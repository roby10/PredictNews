1,INTC,"Retail, tech lead Wall Street rally before jobs data","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks closed sharply higher and the Nasdaq notched an eighth day of gains on Thursday as improved labor market and retail sales data added to optimism a day before the critical June payrolls report.  Equities have been on a tear recently as improving economic data and a potential resolution to Greece’s fiscal issues paved over fears of slowing growth and contagion stemming from the euro zone’s debt crisis.  The Nasdaq’s 8.3 percent gain over the past eight trading sessions is the most for the index in two years and the S&P’s 6.7 percent rise is its best since September 2010, as the market reacted to news of the Fed’s second round of stimulus. The Dow is up 6.6 percent over the same period.  “It’s all about the data today, which was great, and is causing people to revise their outlooks up for tomorrow,” said Jeffrey Friedman, senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock in Chicago. “We passed through a resistance level of 1,352 on the S&P, and the next stop after that could be new highs for the year.”  All 10 S&P sectors rose, led by materials .GSPM, which gained 1.5 percent, while Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold (FCX.N) climbed 3.7 percent to $55.49.  Both the S&P retail index .RLX and the Dow Jones Transportation Average .DJT hit all-time highs.  Data from payrolls processor ADP showed U.S. private-sector employers added 157,000 jobs last month, more than double what was expected. The report, coupled with a fall in new claims for jobless benefits, raised hopes that a recent slowdown in the economy may only be temporary.  The report fueled speculation that Friday’s non-farm payrolls report from the Labor Department would provide more evidence of an improving labor market, a key factor if markets are to rally into the end of the year.  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI shot up 93.47 points, or 0.74 percent, to 12,719.49. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX gained 14 points, or 1.05 percent, to 1,353.22. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC climbed 38.64 points, or 1.36 percent, to 2,872.66.  The market’s rally has some analysts calling for a near-term pullback.  “I can’t make a case from this rally that we’re home clear,” said James Meyer, chief investment officer of Tower Bridge Advisers in West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania. “We’ve gone from the bottom of the range to the top, and I suspect trading will be choppy around here.”  Retailers were among the best performers after several top companies reported better-than-expected sales gains for June, using bargains to lure shoppers in an uncertain economy.  Target Corp (TGT.N) jumped 6.7 percent to $51.67 while Macy’s Inc (M.N) added 5.5 percent to $30.46 and Gap Inc (GPS.N) gained 5.2 percent to $19.28. The S&P retail index .RLX gained 2.4 percent to close at 557.26, a new high.  Elsewhere, the semiconductor index .SOX rose 2.1 percent and added to the Nasdaq’s gains. Intel Corp (INTC.O), a Dow component, rose 2.1 percent to $23.23.  There were some glimmers of a potential compromise that would avoid a debt default as President Barack Obama and top congressional leaders searched for ways to break a deadlock over spending and taxes.  Volume was light again, with about 6.69 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, below last year’s daily average of 8.47 billion.  Almost four stocks rose for every one that fell on the New York Stock Exchange while on the Nasdaq, three stocks rose for every one that fell.

Cowan        AMSTERDAM, July 13 (Reuters) - Dutch electronic chip  manufacturing equipment maker ASML Holding   says its customers are holding back on new orders as sales of computers and mobile phones slow, joining a list of technology firms warning over weak consumer demand.    Shares in ASML, a bellwether for the European tech sector, were down 4.3 percent at 24.59 euros by 1002 GMT, making them the biggest decliner in the FTSEurofirst 300 index. The stock touched an eight-month low at the opening, when it fell as much as 8.4 percent.        “It is clear the industry is heading for a slowdown,” said Victor Bareno from SNS Securites.        ASML, the world’s largest maker of semiconductor lithography machines which map out electronic circuits on silicon wafers, said it still expects 2011 sales to top 5 billion euros ($7.1 billion).	   The average selling price for all its new and used systems sold in the second quarter was 21.2 million euros, up from 20.4 million euros in the same period of 2010.	   But Chief Executive Eric Meurice warned that second-quarter orders came in lower than expected at a total of 840 million euros for ASML’s standard systems and said bookings in the third quarter would not exceed 500 million euros.        “Our customers are currently taking some time to assess the semiconductor end-demand trends for 2012 before determining their overall capacity plans, levels and timings,” Meurice said.   Other tech companies have also recently highlighted concerns about weak consumer spending, particularly in the personal computer market, pointing to slow revenue growth and worrying economic indicators including jobs numbers and rising inflation.   U.S. chip manufacturing equipment maker Applied Materials Inc on Tuesday said tough economic conditions were hurting demand. Novellus Systems Inc and Microchip Technology Inc warned of slowing sales and flat order books earlier this week.        “It looks very much like semiconductor companies are beginning to cut capital expenditure despite their bullish commentary and it heralds the beginning of our long-held concern that 2012 may be a significant down-year on 2011,” said Nomura analyst Richard Windsor in a research note.        SNS analyst Bareno said that the drop in orders in the short term, especially in the foundry sector, was worse than expected, reflecting the current economic uncertainty, but does not necessarily point to a recession in 2012.        Peter Olofsen, an analyst at Kepler Capital Markets in Amsterdam, said the third-quarter bookings gave few clues as to the outlook for 2012.        Olofsen said that faltering demand for mobile phone handsets, personal computers and televisions, combined with ASML’s falling order book, suggested that the foundries are reassessing their capital spending plans.        Retail sales figures for those products in September to November will provide a much clearer picture for 2012, he added.   On Wednesday ASML said it booked 840 million euros worth of systems in the second quarter.        Analysts in a Reuters poll had expected ASML to book second-quarter orders of 945 million euros, down 20 percent from a year ago, but up from 845 million euros in the first quarter.    Peter Wennink, ASML’s chief financial officer, said it was normal for customers to take a pause after a period of very strong growth in 2010 and early 2011. Wennink said he expected the correction to last a few quarters and to then see a rebound, adding that the overall picture for 2012 still looked healthy.    ASML reported a second-quarter net profit of 432 million euros, up from 239 million a year ago on sales of 1.53 billion euros, in line with analysts’ expectations for sales of 1.53 billion.         ASML has a global market share of around 70 percent and competes with Japan’s Nikon Corp and Canon Inc  . It counts Intel Corp , Samsung Electronics Co  and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing  among its customers.

4,INTC,Would-be investors shun Mexican 'broadband for all'," * Mexico broadband plan has $1 billion hole, little cash   * Would-be partners say they will not cough up capital   * If plan fails, Mexico could push to get spectrum back   By Patrick Rucker and Elinor Comlay   MEXICO CITY, July 14 (Reuters) - Potential investors in a Mexico-wide mobile broadband network are turning their backs on the deal, increasing the risk that the ambitious project could collapse and send regulators back to the drawing board.   Mexico telecoms company MVS Comunicaciones said in April it had high-profile partners on board to help raise the $1 billion it estimated it would need to jump-start a shared national fourth-generation “broadband for all” network.   U.S. chip maker Intel (INTC.O) as well as wireless operator Clearwire CLWR.O and local telecoms company Alestra were ready to contribute hundreds of millions of dollars to the project, Jose Abad, an MVS executive, said in April.   But Intel and Clearwire told Reuters this week that they have no plans to invest in the proposed broadband network that would give Latin America’s second-largest economy a boost.   “Intel is open to working with anyone to boost broadband in the country, however, for the moment, we do not have any plans to partner with MVS,” Elisa Martinez, a spokeswoman for Intel in Mexico, told Reuters in an email.   Clearwire said that the company has good relations with MVS but that it would not put any money to work in the broadband plan. An Alestra official said the company would like to be a partner but declined to say whether it would put up any cash.   A spokesman for MVS did not answer specific questions about the project’s financing and said that the matter could only be resolved once the government set the terms — and fees — required to renew the spectrum licenses.   The World Bank estimates that every 10 percent increase in broadband service boosts gross domestic product by roughly 1.4 percent in developing economies — a figure MVS has cited.   Mexico has the fewest wireless broadband subscribers in the 34-member OECD, with just 0.5 per 100 inhabitants, according to December 2010 data. The country also lags in fixed broadband subscriptions, with just 10.4 per 100 inhabitants.   Hector Olavarria, an official in Mexico’s Transport and Communications Ministry, was quoted by Mexican media as saying on Wednesday he was upbeat on the proposal, in part because MVS had won partners for the broadband plan and that the ministry would explain their vision for the spectrum in a few days.   The ministry did not reply to a request for comment.   Mexico has for years urged MVS to find a partner to turn the spectrum into a viable broadband network. MVS has been using the 190 MHz bandwidth in the 2.5 GHz spectrum for TV.   Regulators considered suing MVS to retake the spectrum several years ago but officials and industry sources say such a bruising battle would be difficult now since President Felipe Calderon has less than eighteen months to run in his term.   MVS has a hold on the bandwidth until 2018, but the costs and complex nature of its plan for the broadband network has raised questions about its ongoing viability.   “Creating a network at 2.5 GHz — at the high end of the usable radio spectrum — is going to mean a very dense build,” said HSBC telecoms analyst Richard Dineen, who noted the would-be partners of MVS have no major customer base.   Conventional broadband deals around the world involve a single telecoms company building out a proprietary network that it offers to its own customers, Dineen said.   The MVS plan is more complicated since it envisions several investors laying the network and then charging third parties — like broadcasters Televisa (TV.N) and TV Azteca TVAZTCACPO.MX or Carlos Slim’s America Movil (AMX.N) — for access.   Slim’s telecom rivals in Mexico would be eager to get its hands on a large, unbroken span of broadband spectrum and an auction might even draw foreign players.   As long as the issue is unresolved, dominant telecoms firms like America Movil will profit, a consumer group said.   “This wasted time just benefits incumbents,” said Adriana Labardini of consumer group Al Consumidor. “If MVS is not qualified, the government must say so and put it to auction.”  (Reporting by Patrick Rucker and Elinor Comlay; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)   ",7142011,http://www.reuters.com/article/mexico-broadband/would-be-investors-shun-mexican-broadband-for-all-idUSN1E76D1IU20110714

The company, which makes analog chips for PCs, mobile phones and automobiles, said third-quarter gross margins will decline 25-75 basis points.	   Fairchild expects third-quarter sales to be flat to up 3 percent sequentially, which translates to revenue of about $433.2-$446.2 million.	   Analysts on an average were looking for third-quarter revenue of $440.5 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   Second-quarter net income rose 2.5 percent to $44.9 million, or 34 cents a share. Excluding special items, the company earned 41 cents a share.	   Revenue rose 6 percent to $433.2 million.	   Second-quarter sales at the company’s power conversion, industrial and automotive (PCIA) segment — which accounts for more than half of its revenue — rose 7 percent sequentially, it said in a statement. 	   “As expected, we saw muted but still seasonally better sales in the computing and consumer markets,” CEO Mark Thompson said.	   Analysts on an average had expected second-quarter adjusted profit of 40 cents a share, on revenue of $430.3 million.	   Shares of the South Portland, Maine-based company closed at $16.13 on Wednesday on Nasdaq. They have fallen more than 12 percent since the company reported its first-quarter results in April.

6,INTC,Samsung study rejects claims semiconductor plants caused cancers,"GIHEUNG, South Korea (Reuters) - A study commissioned by Samsung Electronics rejected assertions that employees may have been exposed to carcinogenic chemicals at its plants, as several cancer-stricken former employees of the world’s top memory chipmaker seek compensation for their illnesses.  Despite the findings, the South Korean firm said it would consider offering financial support for some of its former employees diagnosed with cancer, following allegations by civic groups and some former employees that its working environment caused leukemia.  Samsung says 26 of its employees who worked at its chip plants had been diagnosed with leukemia or lymphoma, and 10 of them had died of cancer. Civic groups say there are many more workers who have gotten ill due to hazardous working environment.  Samsung commissioned U.S. consulting firm Environ Corp last year to conduct an investigation following continued pressure, despite two previous studies by the government, which found no problems at Samsung’s plants.  Samsung is the world’s largest chipmaker after Intel Corp and earned $27.8 billion from chip sales last year. Its sprawling semiconductor factories in Giheung, where its chip business first started in early 1980s, employ more than 30,000 people.  The study focused on six cases involved in compensation claims and concluded there was no link between workplace exposure and diagnosed cancers.  “We did not find a link between exposure to cancer-causing chemicals and the health conditions of six employees,” Paul Harper, principal of the health sciences consulting firm, told reporters on Thursday.  Formaldehyde, ionizing radiation and trichloroethylene were the only chemicals and agents used or detected on Samsung’s lines that are known to be related to the cancers in question, Environ said.  None of the six cases were exposed to the carcinogens in sufficient quantities to be associated with increased risks of cancer, Environ said.  The old chip production lines where employees worked and later developed the illnesses were converted into chip test lines and light emitting diode production lines. The study was based on reconstructed exposures estimated by similar exposure groups.  The finding comes after a Seoul court last month ruled in favor of two former Samsung employees. In its ruling, the Seoul Administrative Court said although the precise cause of the workers’ illness wasn’t clear, it can be construed that their exposures to chemicals may have had some connection with their illness.  A total of nine cases are filed against the government-run Korea Workers Compensation & Welfare Service but not directly against Samsung.  The government fund said it appealed against the ruling on Thursday and Samsung said its review was not aimed at influencing the court case.  “It’s not part of our legal strategy but rather part of our attempt to fully access whether there are any problems in Samsung’s working environment,” a Samsung executive in legal department told reporters.  Civic groups and activists expressed skepticism about results of the study, which was reviewed by researchers from Harvard University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Michigan and Yale University.  Samsung didn’t disclose the full report of the review, citing confidentiality agreement with its chemicals suppliers, and said it will consider releasing parts of the document after more review.  If the court case is finalized as industrial accident, it could deal a blow to the reputation of Samsung, which boasts a global high-tech manufacturer of flat screens, semiconductors and handsets.  Samsung reiterated on Thursday that chemicals used during the chip making process at its plants had not caused the cancers.  “Samsung has worked to transparently address questions about workplace health and safety...We believe this study...is consistent with previous studies that found no correlation between the workplace environment and employee illness,” Kwon Oh-hyun, head of Samsung’s chip business, told reporters.  The reputation of the electronics sector as a clean industry has been challenged in the past decade by cancer developments from those who worked at computer parts manufacturer.  In 2003, two former workers of International Business Machine sued the firm, claiming their exposure to chemicals in computer disk drive factory made them sick and ultimately gave them cancer.  Later the claim was cleared by a U.S. court, and IBM commissioned independent review, which concluded that its workplace conditions did not cause cancer or other fatal illnesses.

8,INTC,EXCLUSVE-UPDATE 2-TSMC to make new Apple chips on trial - source," * TSMC testing manufacture of next generation chip - source   * Orders would depend on yield rate- source   * TSMC declines comment; Apple not available to comment   * Move would be a potential blow to supplier Samsung Electronics   * Change of supplier would be tricky for Apple-analysts   (Adds analyst comment, details)	   By Clare Jim and Argin Chang	   TAIPEI, July 15 (Reuters) - Taiwan’s TSMC has begun trial manufacturing of next generation chips for Apple Inc’s mobile devices, a source with knowledge of the matter said on Friday, in a sign that the iPad maker is shifting from its traditional chip supplier, Samsung Electronics  .	   Samsung is the sole supplier of the A5 chips used in the iPad 2, but Apple has hinted it is keen to diversify away from the Korean company. The two are battling a legal dispute over patents, and Samsung has also emerged as Apple’s toughest competitor in the smartphone and tablet market.	   Apple faces several hurdles should it want to make a switch to TSMC, including patents and chip design issues as well as a push by Samsung to retain the business.	   “Apple is trying to diversify its orders but it will still maintain some kind of relationship with Samsung,” said Fubon Securities analyst William Wang.	   “I think TSMC will get the new chip orders, the issue however is allocation. Apple won’t give the whole 100 percent to TSMC. Maybe it’ll allocate only 20-30 percent.”	   Analysts and other sources had previously said TSMC, the world’s largest contract chip maker, was set to become a supplier of a next-generation processor chip to Apple, likely starting next year. However the chip may not be called the A6, as some reports have indicated, the sources said.	   TSMC is an obvious candidate to win processor business from Apple as it has budgeted $7.8 billion this year to update technology and add capacity. It also has experience with the architecture of British chip designer ARM Holdings Plc , widely used by Apple to make power-efficient mobile chips.	   TSMC spokeswoman Elizabeth Sun told Reuters she could not comment on this issue or on market rumours. Apple was not immediately available for comment and a Samsung spokesman declined to comment.	   Shares of TSMC have slipped 1.5 percent so far this year, outperforming the broader market’s 4.4 percent decline.	   “TSMC has got all the authorisation and details ready. Whether Apple puts in a formal order will depend on the yield rate,” said the source with knowledge of the matter, who requested anonymity on the grounds of not being authorised to speak to the media.	   The source did not provide further details of the orders.	   Whether TSMC would get actual orders for the chips would depend on its yield rate, or the amount of chips per batch that come out with no defects, the source said. 	   The global semiconductor industry is set to grow by 7.2 percent this year, boosted by soaring sales of tablets and smart phones, research firm His iSuppli says.	   The market for tablets, created only last year with Apple’s iPad, is expected to surge to 108 million devices next year from an estimated 70 million in 2011 and just 17.6 million in 2010, according to research firm Gartner.	   Some analysts said any switch by Apple from Samsung could be tricky.	   “It won’t be easy for Apple to dramatically change its chip provider from Samsung,” said Seo Won-seok, an analyst at NH Investment and Securities in Seoul.	   “It has to redesign the chipset, which Samsung has been deeply involved from the beginning and has some intellectual property. Apple could try various suppliers but they (Samsung and Apple) need each other and the relationship will continue.”	   The A5 chip is designed by the California company and analysts say it is based on British chip designer ARM Holdings   technology. Details of Apple’s technology are hard to come by though given its obsession with secrecy. 	   Andrew Lu, Hong Kong-based head of semiconductor research at Barclays Capital in Asia ex-Japan, also said he was doubtful that Apple would use TSMC to make the same chips as Samsung. It is more likely that TSMC will make what he calls A-X chips used for different products. 	   “TSMC and Apple would have to come up with their own, and they cannot infringe Samsung’s patent, which includes the system design and memory packaging,” he said.	   If TSMC manages to win all orders for the next generation chip, its earnings per share would be lifted by T$2 a year, Prudential Financial Securities Investment Trust’s senior fund manager Bevan Yeh said. The T$2 would mean a one-third boost to TSMC’s EPS based on the company’s 2010 earnings.	   “Samsung will try everything it can and offer a very low price to save the orders,” said Yeh, adding that Samsung, which had just built a new fab for Intel , might offer a price low enough just to cover the variable costs, or offer a bundled package that includes different components.

9,INTC,"UPDATE 5-IBM's services signings surge, stock rises"," * Signings up better-than-expected 16 percent   * Sets positive tone for tech earns, corporate spending   * Shares rise 2 percent  (Adds comment from IBM execs on Europe, hardware sales)    By Jim Finkle    BOSTON, July 18 (Reuters) - IBM’s (IBM.N) signings of new business at its services division surged 16 percent in the second quarter, trouncing expectations and raising hopes that  2011 will be a good year for the technology sector.   Investors had feared that technology sales would slow in the second half, hurt by the economic uncertainty in Europe and Japan, as well as a drop in government spending. But IBM offset those challenges with strong growth in developing markets from Brazil to China, and robust sales of a new line of mainframe computers.   Analysts said the results marked a strong start to the tech earnings season, with other bellwethers such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) set to report quarterly results in coming days. [ID:nN1E76H1KN]   “As I look for the balance of the earnings reports this week, I think it’s going to set a pretty good tone,” said Keith Wirtz, chief investment officer for Fifth third Asset Management.   International Business Machines Corp shares climbed 2 percent to a record high on the news. The company also raised its full-year profit forecast after second-quarter results beat Wall Street estimates.   “Good service signings reflect that they are capturing their share of the solid IT spending that we’re seeing in the market now,” said Edward Jones analyst Josh Olson.   “IT spending and demand for software and services remains healthy despite all this economic turmoil, and businesses continue to invest in efficiency,” he said. “We’re seeing that in these results.” ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    Graphic showing Q2 overview: tech and telecom   r.reuters.com/nuw62s ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>   IBM said on Monday that signings rose to $14.3 billion during the second quarter, beating Wall Street projections and easing investor concerns after the closely watched number dropped in the first quarter.   Deutsche Bank said in a research note that analysts on average had expected signings of $12 billion to $13 billion.   Investors believe signings is a key indicator of future profits. But IBM says the focus should be more on total backlog of business, which grew by $15 billion during the quarter to $144 billion.   Some $8 billion of the $15 billion increase in backlog came from the developing economies that IBM defines as “growth markets.”   Some investors had feared that corporations will keep a tight grip on 2011 technology budgets, waiting out the economic uncertainty in the United States and Europe.   But developing markets drove top line growth for IBM. On a constant-currency basis, revenue leaped 13 percent in growth markets — which includes the BRIC countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China — far outpacing the 3 percent sales growth chalked up in so-called major markets.   The growth in developing countries was led by sales to financial services firms and communications companies.   “We’ve got real momentum in the financial service sector. It’s a strong place for us,” Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said.   He added that business in Europe had improved, with sales in Germany and Italy returning to growth during the quarter.   IBM reported second-quarter profit, excluding items, of $3.09 per share, beating the average Wall Street forecast of $3.03, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   Revenue rose 12 percent from a year earlier to $26.67 billion, ahead of the average forecast of $25.35 billion.   Shares in the Armonk, New York, company rose to $178.90 in extended trade, beating the previous record high of $177.76 on July 6. They had fallen 26 cents to $175.28 in regular New York Stock Exchange trade on Monday.   Analysts said Wall Street had priced in strong growth expectations, limiting the stock’s after-hours rally.   “Expectations are pretty high for this name right now. We’ve seen it do very well this year, up 20 percent or so to date,” Olson said   Sales of IBM’s Unix server computers rose 12 percent from a year earlier.   The company said it won more than 250 server accounts away from rivals, resulting in over $300 million in sales. About 60 percent of this came from Oracle Corp ORCL.O and 30 percent from Hewlett Packard Co (HPQ.N), IBM said.   Both Oracle and HP declined to comment.

10,INTC,"Chip outlook down on economy, PC sales, inventories","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Doubts about the economy and sluggish PC sales are clouding the second-half outlook for Intel and other chip makers as they prepare to unveil quarterly earnings this week.  High U.S. unemployment and the risk of a financial crisis in Europe are hurting demand for consumer electronics, and some investors worry high chip inventories could cause a slowdown in new orders later in 2011.  Those concerns are exacerbating the summertime blues semiconductor stocks sometimes face mid-year, as demand for chips drops off before picking up again during the back-to-school and holiday seasons.  The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index has dropped 15 percent since the end of April, worse than a 4 percent dip in the Dow Jones industrial average.  Top PC chipmaker Intel is in a standoff against investors who believe high U.S. unemployment and a growing preference for Apple’s iPad 2 are hobbling demand for consumer laptops.  A quarter ago, Intel handily beat earnings expectations and said it expects 2011 worldwide PC sales to grow in the “low double digits”, well above consensus, saying independent forecasters were missing millions of PCs now being built by small manufacturers in China and other emerging markets.  But investors remain skeptical and believe Intel, whose stock is trading at just 9 times expected earnings, will be forced to humbly reduce its PC growth outlook by around half — if not when it reports on Wednesday, then later this year.  Intel typically forecasts revenue for the coming quarter and the full year when it releases quarterly profit.  “Even if they end up hitting that bullish guidance, we’re in a condition where the market doesn’t believe it,” said Gleacher & Company analyst Doug Freedman. “Everyone says it’s just a matter of time before Intel cuts numbers, so they’re not going to buy this stock until expectations are low.”  Intel’s revenue in the current quarter is seen increasing about 5 percent over the second quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, less than normal growth of around 8 percent for this time of year.  “The numbers are probably a little too high,” said Hampton Adams, a portfolio manager at Gamble Jones Investment Counsel in Pasadena, California. “A lot of the demand in the near term has been for tablets, wireless devices — and that’s hurt PCs.”  Underscoring worries in the tech sector, Dutch chip gear maker ASML Holding warned last week that tough economic times were hurting demand for PCs and smartphones. It and other equipment makers said their foundry and memory customers were rethinking plans to expand capacity and order new gear.  After the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan last March, electronics companies, worried about shortages, rushed to stock up on components.  But with manufacturers now less concerned with Japan-related shortages than with persistent U.S. unemployment and the risk of a financial crisis in Europe, high inventories have become a concern and purchasing managers may be ordering fewer new chips.  Some analysts, while cautious about risks in the economy, said relatively high inventories of many kinds of chips are not alarming given the industry’s recent strong growth and recovery from a deep recession.  “Tech in 10 of the last 10 years has traded down through the summer. People like to pour salt in the wounds of seasonality.” said JMP Securities analyst Alex Gauna.  “These macro concerns are real but as far as secular drivers go, in terms of demand for tablets and smartphones, the real business case for cloud computing and the need for bandwidth to make all this work, absolutely I’m constructive,” he said.  Investors will be watching this week for comments about inventories and the economy from programmable chip makers Altera and Xilinx, embedded chipmaker Freescale, memory maker SanDisk and Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices as they report their earnings.  Investors are more upbeat about Qualcomm, which reports at the same time as Intel and may have won some new business with the expected launch of a new Apple iPhone using its baseband chips.

13,INTC,"Intel pulls back PC market outlook, shares slide","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp trimmed its forecast for 2011 personal computer unit sales, warning of softness in mature markets and sending its shares more than 1 percent lower.  The top maker of microprocessors for PCs now expects 8 to 10 percent growth in unit shipments of computers this year, down from the low double-digits it had stuck to earlier in defiance of fears that market momentum was decelerating.  Intel’s processors are used in 80 percent of the world’s computers, but mobile devices from Apple Inc’s iPad to Google Inc Android smartphones are eating into PC sales and Intel is struggling to gain a foothold in the fast-expanding mobile market.  Its Atom division, which caters to a mobile computing market, saw revenue slide 15 percent to $352 million.  “The mature market consumer segment is still soft, but the emerging market consumer segment is healthy and growing,” CEO Paul Otellini told analysts on a conference call.  Doubts about high U.S. unemployment, the risk of a European financial crisis, climbing inventories and sluggish PC sales had clouded the second-half outlook for Intel and other chip makers like Advanced Micro Devices.  The tepid forecast and lingering concerns about the second half overshadowed a solid quarter for the chip giant. Its quarterly results and revenue forecast both trumped Wall Street’s expectations.  Gains in the second quarter were driven by the PC group, Intel’s largest segment, and the data center group, which has been expanding quickly in part because of cloud computing.  Intel’s upbeat results followed positive quarterly earnings from Apple and International Business Machines Corp earlier this week.  The company foresaw current-quarter revenue of about $14 billion, give or take $500 million, versus the $13.5 billion analysts expect on average.  “When we look across the broader worldwide supply chain for PCs and servers, what we see are inventory levels that are lean out there. People are managing things lean, they’re prudent,” Intel Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told Reuters.  Investors eyeing slow economies and red-hot sales of Apple’s iPad 2 in recent months have insisted Intel’s outlook for PC growth is overly optimistic. Analysts had warned that Intel at some point may be forced to trim its estimate.  “The primary question investors are going to ask now is where Intel is seeing the fundamental strength in the PC market,” said Evercore Partners analyst Patrick Wang. “It’s hard to have any confidence in how they are going to deliver 7 percent growth sequentially.”  Analysts on average had expected Intel’s revenue to rise to $13.5 billion in the current quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, less than normal growth for this time of year.

15,INTC,"Apple rolls out new Macs, shares set record","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc shares flirted with a record $400 on Wednesday, a day after the world’s most valuable technology company posted blockbuster results and triggered a spate of brokerage upgrades.  The stock set a lifetime high as a new $999 MacBook Air and $599 “Mac mini” go on sale, the latter rivaling some of the cheaper offerings from Dell Inc or Hewlett-Packard Co.  Apple’s stock climbed 3.3 percent to $389.18, bringing the makers of the iPhone and iPad within shouting distance of Exxon Mobil’s market value of more than $400 billion despite the oil and gas producer raking in more than four times Apple’s annual revenue.  In coming months, Apple is expected to roll out a new iPhone, which is likely to give the world’s most valuable technology company another shot in the arm and offer a challenge to rivals such as Google Inc and Research in Motion.  The new phone could also propel Apple to leap past Exxon.  “We expect Apple will become the largest market cap company on the planet when the stock hits approximately $445 which is only about 13 percent away from aftermarket levels,” said Gleacher & Co analyst Brian Marshall, adding that this is based on the assumption that Exxon shares remain flat.  Apple shares rose to a high of $405 in after-hours trading on Tuesday after iPhone sales and strong Asian business helped Apple’s quarterly results beat Wall Street’s expectations. Sales of its iconic products far outpaced forecasts, helping drive a near doubling of revenue in the fiscal third quarter.  “China is showing phenomenal strength for Apple and was up six-fold,” Wells Fargo analyst Jason Maynard said. “This remains a huge opportunity for Apple and, in our view, is a major differentiator for the company. Apple has been able to successfully monetize China where competitors have been challenged.”  Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo raised their estimates on Apple’s yearly earnings by 10 and 13 percent. Caris & Co raised their price target to $600 from $500, while Brigantine Advisors raised their target on the stock to $450 from $400.  “We find Apple’s valuation compelling, particularly based on the upside potential from revenue and earnings growth in the Mac/PC and iPhone segments and from gross margins,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note to clients.  Apple moved 20.34 million iPhones during the quarter, which analysts say helped it vault past Nokia and Samsung Electronics to become the world’s biggest smartphone maker.  While iPhones remain the flagship device, the company touted its new line of Intel-powered Macs on Wednesday and the latest version of its operating software, the multi-touch enabled Mac OS X Lion.  Mac shipments have helped Apple make the top-three among PC vendors in the United States, the first time it has done so in years, according to research firm Gartner.  Analysts worry that the success of the iPad will take away from not just Microsoft Windows PC sales, but also Apple’s Mac business, something the company dismisses.  “It’s taking away from the PC. When we surveyed people who buy iPads, more of them were choosing it instead of a computer,” marketing chief Phil Schiller told Reuters.  “More are choosing it instead of a Windows computer than choosing it instead of a Mac.”  ",7202011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple/apple-rolls-out-new-macs-shares-set-record-idUSTRE76I0KW20110720
16,INTC,Wall Street closes flat as debt worries offset earns,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks closed near unchanged on Wednesday, a day after Wall Street’s best rally since March, as the oncoming debt ceiling deadline overshadowed strong earnings from Apple Inc.  Apple (AAPL.O) hit another all-time high one day after the maker of the iPhone and iPad reported quarterly revenues that far exceeded expectations.  The stock jumped 2.7 percent to $386.90 but, overall, investors sat on their hands amid the unresolved debt ceiling crisis in Washington. The White House and Congress were negotiating a deal to raise the U.S. debt ceiling before a looming default on August 2.  “The big elephant in the room is the debate about the debt ceiling, and as the clock ticks we all know that we are going to have a deal. It’s just how soon,” said Mohannad Aama, managing director at Beam Capital Management LLC in New York.  “Until then, the market is going to be affected by the daily news that is coming out of earnings season.”  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI lost 15.51 points, or 0.12 percent, at 12,571.91. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX shed 0.89 points, or 0.07 percent, at 1,325.84. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC fell 12.29 points, or 0.43 percent, at 2,814.23.  Technology shares were lower, with Yahoo Inc YHOO.O tumbling 7.6 percent to $13.48 after reporting lackluster results, and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) dropping 1.7 percent to $27.06 ahead of its quarterly report on Thursday.  Financials were the best performing sector, boosted by a 4.4 percent rise in US Bancorp (USB.N) to $26.14. The Midwestern regional bank said second-quarter net income rose by 57 percent. The KBW Bank index .BKX climbed 1.5 percent.  In extended trade, chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) shed 0.7 percent to $22.84, while American Express Co (AXP.N) added 0.3 percent to $52.26. Intel issued a current-quarter revenue forecast that trumped estimates, while American Express’ profits topped expectations.  Sovereign debt problems in Europe and the protracted political battle over increasing the U.S. debt ceiling have weighed on stocks. On Tuesday, there was progress toward a $3.75 billion U.S. budget deal, prompting a late rally, but a resolution remained elusive.  European Union leaders must find a convincing solution to Greece’s debt crisis at a Thursday summit or the global economy will pay the price, the head of the European Commission said in an unusually somber warning.  On the U.S. economic front, existing home sales fell unexpectedly to a seven-month low in June as cancellations of pending contracts surged, according to the National Association of Realtors.  Volume was light with about 6.38 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Amex and Nasdaq, below the daily average of 7.48 billion.

Apple (AAPL.O) hit another all-time high one day after the maker of the iPhone and iPad reported quarterly revenues that far exceeded expectations. For details, see [ID:nN1E76I1K8]   The stock jumped 2.7 percent to $386.90 but, overall, investors sat on their hands amid the unresolved debt ceiling crisis in Washington. The White House and Congress were negotiating a deal to raise the U.S. debt ceiling before a looming default on Aug. 2. [ID:nN1E76I25I]   “The big elephant in the room is the debate about the debt ceiling, and as the clock ticks we all know that we are going to have a deal. It’s just how soon,” said Mohannad Aama, managing director at Beam Capital Management LLC in New York.   “Until then, the market is going to be affected by the daily news that is coming out of earnings season.”   The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI lost 15.51 points, or 0.12 percent, at 12,571.91. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX shed 0.89 points, or 0.07 percent, at 1,325.84. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC fell 12.29 points, or 0.43 percent, at 2,814.23.   Technology shares were lower, with Yahoo Inc YHOO.O tumbling 7.6 percent to $13.48 after reporting lackluster results, and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) dropping 1.7 percent to $27.06 ahead of its quarterly report on Thursday.   Financials were the best performing sector, boosted by a 4.4 percent rise in US Bancorp (USB.N) to $26.14. The Midwestern regional bank said second-quarter net income rose by 57 percent. The KBW Bank index .BKX climbed 1.5 percent. [ID:nN1E76I1NT]   In extended trade, chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) shed 0.7 percent to $22.84, while American Express Co (AXP.N) added 0.3 percent to $52.26.

[ID:nN1E76I25R] and [ID:nN1E76J1RI]   Sovereign debt problems in Europe and the protracted political battle over increasing the U.S. debt ceiling have weighed on stocks. On Tuesday, there was progress toward a $3.75 billion U.S. budget deal, prompting a late rally, but a resolution remained elusive.   European Union leaders must find a convincing solution to Greece’s debt crisis at a Thursday summit or the global economy will pay the price, the head of the European Commission said in an unusually somber warning.

19,INTC,How to play it: Apple surges after stellar results,"NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Apple Inc’s stellar quarterly results trounced Wall Street expectations and sent the company’s shares up more than 5 percent on Wednesday. The iPhone maker said revenue nearly doubled in its fiscal third quarter.  The question: What’s the best way to take advantage of Apple’s climb and is there any downside?  The number one way to benefit from Apple’s momentum is to buy the company’s shares and hold onto them for at least two years, said Steve Coleman, a portfolio manager with Daedalus Capital who has owned Apple stock for seven years.  “It’s dirt cheap and its prospects are fabulous,” Coleman said. “I think it’s its own asset class and its own store of value.”  Apple shares’ record high of $396.27 hit on Wednesday marked a more than 20 percent gain from the start of the year and a more than 50 percent rise from a year ago to date. But given the high profile of Apple and company CEO Steve Jobs — who has been on leave since January for undisclosed medical reasons — the stock is also susceptible to short-term market swings.  “If something happens to Steve Jobs tomorrow, the stock may go down 50 bucks, so you have to be careful and have it in moderation,” said Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management, who recommends starting with a 5 percent position. “There are always things that could trip them up.”  The stock has also benefited from the bullish sentiment in the tech sector after International Business Machines Corp, a bellwether for the industry, delivered strong earnings earlier this week. The S&P information technology index jumped 2.7 percent, the best performing sector, on Tuesday.  Ticonderoga Securities raised its 12-month price target for Apple to $666 from $612 on Wednesday, citing the combination of Apple’s inexpensive valuation and momentum.  While suppliers may benefit down the line from Apple’s business growth, many of these companies are not necessarily known because Apple makes it a point not to disclose names.  As a consequence, there is not as much certainty over to what extent Apple suppliers are poised to benefit from Apple’s profit climb. Even among the known suppliers, their stock will not necessarily jump in tandem with Apple’s because of additional factors like individual company earnings or announcements.  Cirrus Logic and OmniVision Technologies are two Apple suppliers that have benefited from Apple’s upswing. Cirrus shares closed up 4.4 percent on Wednesday, while OmniVision shares rose 3.3 percent.  “The suppliers will definitely benefit,” said Bradshaw, who owns both Cirrus and OmniVision and calls them “top positions.”  Among other known Apple providers, shares of semiconductor provider Marvell fell 0.7 percent on Wednesday, while digital wireless product maker Qualcomm shares were up 0.6 percent and chip maker Intel Corp shares were down 0.3 percent. APPLE OPTIONS  Apple shares have been a winning bet for a long time but with the stock nearing $400 some option strategists suggest investors could look to minimize their risk by betting on more gains, only not exorbitant ones.  Assuming a stock will only rally a little bit is not normal for someone who only invests in stocks. But for investors who use the options market, it’s a common occurrence, says Steve Place, a founder of options analytics firm InvestingWithOptions in Mobile, Alabama.  The way to put on trades like this is not easy — it takes a bit of knowledge about how options work. Unlike a stock, options have other components that influence pricing, one of which is time decay — an erosion of the options premium as it nears expiration.  One trade suggested by Place is a so-called “iron butterfly” strategy. He recommends the September Apple options contracts to implement this strategy. The iron butterfly is a short volatility bet and has a limited risk, limited reward that makes money if the stock stays around a certain price of the investor’s choosing, said Place.  This trade involves selling a straddle — that is, selling a put option and a call option at the same strike price and expiration date. For instance, selling a call at a $400 strike price and selling a put with the same strike price — that is a bet against volatility.  The next step is to buy a “strangle,” which involves buying a call and a put with two different strike prices — both out-of-the-money — with the same expiration date.  Adding a strangle would limit the risk of a strong move in the underlying shares. The bet makes money if the stock remains close to the strike price of the straddle — such as $400.

21,INTC,Stern Advice: Is it 1999 all over again for tech stocks?,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - I wasn’t one of those people who lost a bunch of money when dot-com stocks blew up in 2000, but to be honest, that’s because I didn’t make a lot of money in the bubblicious run up, either.  I still remember naively waiting for new companies like Amazon, AOL and Pets.com (remember that one?) to show a profit before jumping in.  By the time any of those companies achieved profitability — or didn’t — their share prices had gone through the roof and I had missed my chance for wealth — or ruin.  Today, companies like LinkedIn, Groupon, Zynga and Facebook are partying like it’s 1999, making plans to come to market or already trading at valuations that put them among the blue chips.  For example, LinkedIn, which went public in May, reached its year’s high of $121.97 on May 19, and had a market capitalization in the neighborhood of $10 billion, even though it is expected to lose money this year. Maybe it will shake up the world of recruiting and business marketing, but still, that is kind of nerve racking. LinkedIn shares fell 7.5 percent in one day this week after the company was downgraded by a JPMorgan analyst.  Some folks want to throw their wallets at those new household names, and others — perhaps more scarred than I was back in 2000 — wouldn’t touch an Internet stock ever again.  “People got burned so badly that they have been virtually ignoring that area,” says Tom Roseen, head of research services at Lipper, a Thomson Reuters company. Ironically, that might make them a good investment.  Stock market watchers don’t know what to do. Is this a new bubble or a buying opportunity? The right answer probably lies somewhere in between. Here are some thoughts:  — It’s not 1999. Back then, there were several new companies across the tech spectrum going public every day without any profits, and immediately they became objects of bidding wars, remembers Scott Kessler, head of technology sector equity research at Standard & Poor’s. The frenzy now seems concentrated in a narrow band of Internet/social networking companies. “It seems like a handful of companies at best,” he said.  The bulk of technology companies, defined more broadly, may actually be conservatively valued. U.S. science and technology mutual funds have returned 2.14 percent year to date through July 14, reports Lipper. That’s less than half the 5.16 percent logged by the S&P500 during the same period.  — Keep emotions out of it. “Don’t be too scarred by what happened a decade ago,” says Kessler. But he also cautions investors not to “get caught up in the excitement and emotions that surround these companies.” Instead, follow the same numbers that serious investors have used for years. Are there earnings? How do the earnings compare to the share prices?  — Think about corporate investments. Big U.S. companies are sitting on more than $850 billion in cash. And it’s pretty clear, given the slow (or nonexistent) recovery in hiring, that they are not spending that money on people. Maybe they’ll spend some of their cash reserves on productivity-improving technology, boosting the tech sector.  — Advisers like tech now. “The overall health of the technology sector remains very strong,” says John Challenger, an outplacement consultant who watches employment trends. “In fact, it is one of the best performing industries in the economy at the moment.”  Kate Warne, a market strategist for St. Louis brokerage Edward Jones, says her firm is recommending traditional tech stocks such as Intel to their clients. “We think many investors need to be adding dollars to this sector. Many of these tech stocks are paying dividends and have very attractive valuations.”  — Use tried-and-true analysis techniques. People got in trouble in 1999 because they stopped looking at bedrock figures like earnings, and instead started paying for things like “clicks” and “eyeballs.”  Kessler says: “When companies pick and chose what metrics they think are most appropriate, that suggests the other metrics that people have historically used for decades are not as favorable.” Meaning that if you actually judged a company on the basis of its earnings, you probably would not buy that company.  That’s telling you something, says Warne. “If they aren’t making money, they probably aren’t something you would want today.” So while the market isn’t the same as 1999, the applicable advice may be: Keep your eye on the bottom line. You may miss the froth, but you can still make money.  (The Personal Finance column appears weekly.

23,INTC,UPDATE 5-Microsoft Windows fizzles as PC fears loom," * Sales up 8 pct to $17.37 bln, vs estimate at $17.23 bln   * Windows sales fall in soft PC market   * Shares close to unchanged in post-market trading  (Rewrites first paragraph)   By Bill Rigby   SEATTLE, July 21 (Reuters) - Sales of Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT.O) flagship Windows software disappointed for the third straight quarter, taking the gloss off better-than-expected earnings that were aided by an unusually low tax rate.   The results failed to excite a market already wary about growth prospects for the company and PC industry as netbook sales give way to tablets. The stock was flat in after-hours trading.   “All eyes are on Windows and how they are ultimately going to extend this franchise in the future, as the PC business continues to lose share to the tablets,” said Josh Olson, technology analyst at money manager Edward Jones. “Microsoft is really a show-me story in terms of its ability to extend its core flagship products to these new growth platforms.”   On Wednesday, chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) warned that PC sales will not be as strong as it had expected this year. [ID:nN1E76I25R]   Microsoft is expected to enter the tablet market in earnest next year with the launch of its next operating system — code-named Windows 8 — which will be compatible with the low-power chips designed by ARM Holdings ARM.L favored by tablet and mobile phone makers.   Despite the Windows dip, Microsoft managed to ease past Wall Street’s earnings estimates, helped by strong sales of its Office software and Xbox game console, as well as a dramatic drop in its tax bill.   The world’s largest software maker follows Google Inc (GOOG.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) in reporting surprisingly good results as technology spending holds up relatively well in an uncertain economy.   The Redmond, Washington-based company on Thursday posted net profit of $5.87 billion, or 69 cents per share, up from $4.52 billion, or 51 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.   That easily beat Wall Street’s average estimate of 58 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Microsoft has beaten the average profit estimate for each of the last nine quarters.   Microsoft was helped by an unusually low tax rate of 7 percent in the quarter, which cut its tax bill by more than $1 billion from the year before, to $445 million. The company, which gets most of its revenue from overseas, said the savings were due to a one-time tax gain and more business flowing through its regional centers in the low-tax jurisdictions of Ireland, Singapore and Puerto Rico.   Sales rose 8 percent to $17.37 billion, ahead of analysts’ average estimate of $17.23 billion, boosted chiefly by sales of Office, Xbox and server software behind Microsoft’s push into Internet-centric, or “cloud” computing.   Microsoft shares fluctuated after the results were announced in after-hours trading, settling close to their closing price of $27.09 on Nasdaq. The stock is up 8 percent over the past 12 months, compared to a 30 percent rise in the Nasdaq composite index .IXIC. The shares are stuck at a level first hit in 1998, adjusted for stock splits.   “These numbers are good. The question is, what will make Microsoft break this range in which it is stuck, between $25 and $28?” said Trip Chowdhry, managing director at Global Equities Research. “I don’t see these numbers giving an indication that the stock is going to break away.”   Spending by businesses on technology has generally outstripped cash-strapped consumers since the worldwide economic downturn.   Microsoft’s business division, which last month rolled out online versions of its popular Office suite of programs such as Outlook, SharePoint and Excel, was the company’s biggest seller in the quarter, racking up a 7 percent increase in sales to $5.8 billion.   The server and tools business, which sells software used by datacenters — an essential building block of cloud computing — posted a 12 percent increase in sales to $4.6 billion.   The entertainment and devices unit, which sells the company’s video game and phone products, posted a 30 percent increase in sales to $1.5 billion, mostly due to the popularity of the Xbox and the new hands-free gaming Kinect add-on.   Sales at the Windows unit fell 0.8 percent to $4.7 billion. PC sales grew only 2.3 percent in the second quarter, according to tech research firm Gartner, well below earlier projections, as economic uncertainty hangs over consumers and Apple’s iPad and other tablets eat into the market.   Microsoft’s perennial money-losing online services unit, which runs the Bing search engine and MSN Internet portal, posted a 16.5 percent increase in sales to $662 million, but its loss widened to $728 million from a loss of $688 million a year ago, as Microsoft continues to pour money into attacking Google. The unit has now lost almost $6.5 billion in the last three fiscal years.

24,INTC,U.S. debt news and euro debt agreement fuel rally,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks climbed on Thursday as signs of progress on the U.S. debt talks and concrete action from Europe on its own debt crisis heartened investors.  Unexpectedly robust earnings results from Morgan Stanley (MS.N), whose shares rose 11 percent to $24.20, extended a relief rally in bank stocks after Goldman Sachs’ dismal trading profits stunned the market earlier in the week.  But the biggest news was on a possible U.S. debt deal to save the United States from an unprecedented default.  “We started drifting until we got a report that the president and the speaker of the House were close to an accord, and the market shot up like a rocket at that point,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.  The KBW Capital Markets index .KSX rose 2.9 percent.  In Europe, following a summit, euro zone leaders agreed the private sector would provide a net 37 billion euros to a second bailout package for Greece, with the total official financing around 109 billion euros.  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI gained 152.50 points, or 1.21 percent, to 12,724.41. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX rose 17.96 points, or 1.35 percent, to 1,343.80. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC advanced 20.20 points, or 0.72 percent, to 2,834.43.  Stocks rallied to session highs after the White House said it saw momentum for a “balanced” deficit deal, but denied reports that U.S. President Barack Obama and Republican U.S. House of Representatives speaker John Boehner were close to a pact.  Transportation shares also contributed to gains after Union Pacific Corp (UNP.N) posted higher quarterly profits. Shares of the railroad company rose 4.6 percent to $104.40, and the Dow Jones transportation index .DJT was up 1.7 percent.  Biotechnology issues also rose.

25,INTC,"Microsoft profit beats Street, Windows fizzle","SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp eased past Wall Street’s earnings estimates, helped by strong sales of its Office software and Xbox game console and an unusually low tax rate.  The result failed to excite the market, given concerns that soft PC sales would curb demand for Microsoft’s flagship Windows product. The stock was flat in after-hours trading.  The world’s largest software maker follows Google Inc, Apple Inc and International Business Machines Corp in reporting surprisingly good results as technology spending holds up relatively well in an uncertain economy.  But Microsoft was hit by waning growth in PC sales, chiefly due to the collapse of netbook sales in favor of tablets. On Wednesday, chipmaker Intel Corp warned that PC sales will not be as strong as it had expected this year.  Sales of Windows, which comes pre-installed in most PCs, were lower than the year-ago period for the third consecutive quarter.  “All eyes are on Windows and how they are ultimately going to extend this franchise in the future, as the PC business continues to lose share to the tablets,” said Josh Olson, technology analyst at money manager Edward Jones. “Microsoft is really a show-me story in terms of its ability to extend its core flagship products to these new growth platforms.”  Microsoft is expected to enter the tablet market in earnest next year with the launch of its next operating system — code-named Windows 8 — which will be compatible with the low-power chips designed by ARM Holdings favored by tablet and mobile phone makers.  The Redmond, Washington-based company on Thursday posted net profit of $5.87 billion, or 69 cents per share, up from $4.52 billion, or 51 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.  That easily beat Wall Street’s average estimate of 58 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Microsoft has beaten the average profit estimate for each of the last nine quarters.  Microsoft was helped by an unusually low tax rate of 7 percent in the quarter, which cut its tax bill by more than $1 billion from the year before, to $445 million. The company, which gets most of its revenue from overseas, said the savings were due to a one-time tax gain and more business flowing through its regional centers in the low-tax jurisdictions of Ireland, Singapore and Puerto Rico.  Sales rose 8 percent to $17.37 billion, ahead of analysts’ average estimate of $17.23 billion, boosted chiefly by sales of Office, Xbox and server software behind Microsoft’s push into Internet-centric, or “cloud” computing.  Microsoft shares fluctuated after the results were announced in after-hours trading, settling close to their closing price of $27.09 on Nasdaq. The stock is up 8 percent over the past 12 months, compared to a 30 percent rise in the Nasdaq composite index. The shares are stuck at a level first hit in 1998, adjusted for stock splits.  “These numbers are good. The question is, what will make Microsoft break this range in which it is stuck, between $25 and $28?” said Trip Chowdhry, managing director at Global Equities Research. “I don’t see these numbers giving an indication that the stock is going to break away.”  Spending by businesses on technology has generally outstripped cash-strapped consumers since the worldwide economic downturn.  Microsoft’s business division, which last month rolled out online versions of its popular Office suite of programs such as Outlook, SharePoint and Excel, was the company’s biggest seller in the quarter, racking up a 7 percent increase in sales to $5.8 billion.  The server and tools business, which sells software used by datacenters — an essential building block of cloud computing — posted a 12 percent increase in sales to $4.6 billion.  The entertainment and devices unit, which sells the company’s video game and phone products, posted a 30 percent increase in sales to $1.5 billion, mostly due to the popularity of the Xbox and the new hands-free gaming Kinect add-on.  Sales at the Windows unit fell 0.8 percent to $4.7 billion. PC sales grew only 2.3 percent in the second quarter, according to tech research firm Gartner, well below earlier projections, as economic uncertainty hangs over consumers and Apple’s iPad and other tablets eat into the market.  Microsoft’s perennial money-losing online services unit, which runs the Bing search engine and MSN Internet portal, posted a 16.5 percent increase in sales to $662 million, but its loss widened to $728 million from a loss of $688 million a year ago, as Microsoft continues to pour money into attacking Google. The unit has now lost almost $6.5 billion in the last three fiscal years.  ",7212011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-microsoft/microsoft-profit-beats-street-windows-fizzle-idUSTRE76K0O020110721
26,INTC,"AMD's outlook shines, CEO hunt top priority","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.N forecast that its revenue will rise faster than Wall Street expected and that its margins will increase, helping its shares to a 6 percent after-hours rally.  The company, a distant second to Intel Corp (INTC.O) in the business of computer microprocessors, also told investors that finding a CEO is a top priority and that it had interviewed several high-quality candidates, but would not be rushed.  AMD stock rose nearly 6 percent to $6.87 after it said revenue would rise between 8 percent and 12 percent in the third quarter compared with the prior quarter. Wall Street had on average expected a sequential gain of 8 percent.  “They’re guiding ahead of Intel for the third quarter. That’s largely a function of anticipated share gains,” said Evercore Partners analyst Patrick Wang. “They clearly feel confident about where they are technologically. It comes down to execution and supply.”  AMD also said its gross margins would increase 1 percentage point in the third quarter from 46 percent in the second quarter.  AMD has been under the temporary stewardship of Tom Seifert since its board ousted Dirk Meyer more than half a year ago, after they disagreed over the chipmaker’s strategy to establish a footprint in a booming market for mobile devices.  “Meeting a timeline is not the driving force for the search: finding the right candidate is,” general counsel Harry Wolin told analysts on a conference call.  AMD is betting that recently launched processors with added graphics horsepower will make it more competitive against Intel.  But much of the market share AMD is battling over is in low-end netbooks — endangered by Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) iPad and other tablets.  Along with a slow economy, exploding sales of the iPad and smartphones are taking some wind out of demand for PC sales.  On Wednesday, Intel trimmed its forecast for 2011 personal computer unit sales, warning of softness in mature markets, although its revenue outlook beat estimates.  Investors have punished the shares of AMD this year because it has yet to stake out significant territory in the mobile market and due to its lack of a permanent CEO.  AMD’s board abruptly removed Meyer in January because of concerns he had not targeted tablet computers and smartphones.  The company’s revenue in the June quarter was $1.57 billion, down 5 percent from the year-ago period.  Analysts expected revenue of $1.58 billion for the second quarter and $1.70 billion for the current quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, about an 8 percent increase.

30,INTC,BUY OR SELL-Are worries about Intel overblown?," (For more Reuters BUY OR SELL stories, click on [BUYSELL/] )   * Bulls eye data centers, dividend, cheap valuation   * Bears worry about economy, tablet cannibalization   By Noel Randewich   SAN FRANCISCO, July 21 (Reuters) - Investors nervous about a sputtering economy dumped Intel Corp’s (INTC.O) shares even after its quarterly results beat estimates, defying analysts who kept their “buy” ratings or raised their price targets.   The world’s top chipmaker on Wednesday scaled back its forecast for the number of PCs likely to be sold this year. [ID:nN1E76I25R]   Some investors believe the company is still too optimistic and worry about high U.S. unemployment, the risk of a European financial crisis and the threat from Apple’s (AAPL.O) iPad.   About 30 analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters Starmine have a “buy” or “strong buy” rating on Intel, with 20 rating the company’s shares “hold” and just three of them recommending investors sell.   Intel’s stock was down 1.4 percent at $22.67 on Thursday afternoon.   “Everyone wants to talk about how Intel took down their PC unit growth forecast. That misses the point. I don’t care. Servers are going to drive growth and profitability,” said MKM Partners analyst Daniel Berenbaum.   Berenbaum, who raised his price target on the stock to $28 from $25 following Wednesday’s report, echoed a view on Wall Street that worries about the Santa Clara, California, company’s failure to gain traction in smartphones and tablets are overblown, given signs of strength in corporate spending.   Like many dependent on the PC market, Intel’s stock has been punished by investors worried that Apple’s iPad is eating into demand for laptops.   Trading at just 10 times expected earnings and with a dividend yield of about 3.7 percent, bullish analysts still spot a bargain.   Nomura downgraded Intel to “reduce” from “neutral” on Thursday, pointing to increased capital-expenditure plans and evidence of a slow, current quarter at other chip and electronics component makers.   Chip gear makers have recently warned that their customers are worried that tough economic conditions will hurt demand for silicon used in cars, tablets and other consumer electronics.   “These data points suggest purchasing managers are cutting orders, which ultimately should come back to Intel,” Nomura analyst Romit Shaw warned in a note to clients.   Strong growth in China and other emerging markets, where many families are buying their first PCs and fueling much of Intel’s growth, is unlikely to persist at current levels for the longer term, bears warn.   Investors also cite Intel’s failure to find a foothold in the fast-expanding market for smartphones and tablets.   Though the size of those mobile-gadget markets remains tiny when compared with the chipmaker’s overall revenue, some experts believe smartphones and tablets signal the end of the PC era that Intel’s business was built upon.   Companies and consumers will continue to use PCs, but their sales will dwindle, they say.

33,INTC,Analysis: Aging PC giants see writing on the wall,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Silicon Valley’s old guard is waking up to the fact that the era of consumer PC may be in its twilight, accelerating the need to invest and adapt to rapidly changing tastes.  This week’s earnings from the giants of technology had one thing in common: they underscored yet again how consumers are increasingly shunning desktop PCs and going mobile.  Intel, which had argued that pessimistic expectations about the market were out of whack, reduced its 2011 PC forecast. Microsoft Windows sales, that reliable indicator of PC market strength, fell short of expectations for the third straight quarter.  And Apple Inc, which single-handedly showed with its iPad that many consumers are more than happy with an unladen, light and mobile computer, obliterated all estimates by selling a whopping 9 million tablets.  “The desktop, at least for consumers, probably doesn’t have a great future, and the iPad and similar tablets can deliver a lot of the functionality of a laptop,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management.  Worldwide shipments of smartphones are already overtaking PCs, and by 2015, more than 300 million tablets will ship — not far behind 479 million PCs expected to be made, according to IHS iSuppli.  To be sure, there’s time left for PCs. Adoption and sale continue to grow rapidly in emerging markets and among corporate users. But even there, increasingly powerful smartphones are entrenched and tablets are creeping in.  Research in Motion’s Playbook — despite poor reviews as the minnow of the tablet market — became the first to win U.S. government certification.  Judging by share performances, Wall Street is taking notice as well. Shares of Apple reached a record this week and are up 21 percent in 2011. Intel has gained 10 percent, a bit better than the broader market, but Microsoft is down about 3 percent.  In January, the board of Advanced Micro Devices, frustrated about the company’s lack of progress in mobile computing, forced out then-Chief executive Dirk Meyer. It is still searching for a candidate to spearhead a major push into mobile.  “It’s important for us to keep our eyes and ears wide open. This compute space is evolving and our technology is evolving so that we can take it beyond the traditional segments we serve today,” AMD Chief Financial Officer Thomas Seifert, standing in as CEO, told Reuters.  HYPER-COMPETITIVE  Amid economic uncertainty and boding poorly for the rest of the year, PC sales edged up just 2.3 percent in the second quarter, according to tech research firm Gartner, well below earlier projections.  Top executives argued that personal computers still shine. But they also say they’re hurrying to adapt to changing consumer preferences, with Microsoft stepping up its mobile strategy by creating future versions of Windows just for tablets.  ARM Holdings’ energy-efficient technology now all but dominates mobile computing, but Intel and AMD are increasing their focus on processors suited for smaller devices. They’re pushing manufacturers to use their chips to build laptops that are in many ways touchscreen tablets.  The market for processors used in smartphones and tablets is about $6.7 billion this year, MKM Partners analyst Daniel Berenbaum estimates. That’s just 12 percent of Intel’s expected 2011 revenue, but that proportion is growing.  Intel is speeding up plans to use its most cutting-edge technology to manufacture chips aimed a mobile devices, and Chief Executive Paul Otellini said this week the company would be “hyper-competitive” in getting its silicon into tablets running Microsoft’s upcoming version of Windows.  “In the next generation it’s going be hard to tell the difference between a tablet and a netbook,” said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy. “To me a tablet is just a netbook that has a solid-state drive and a touchscreen.”  For now, PC-reliant companies can take comfort in under-saturated markets like oft-mentioned China — the world’s second-largest PC market and one where millions remain unfamiliar with computing in general.  In the second quarter, PC shipments in the United States fell 5.6 percent, year over year, while China’s PC market grew 10.9 percent, according to research firm Gartner.  Despite reducing its 2011 PC sales outlook, Intel’s revenue forecast for the September quarter came in higher than expected. For a second quarter, analysts underestimated the demand for PCs in China and other emerging markets.  Consumers in the United States and Europe often have at least one PC at home and increasingly choose to buy gadgets like tablets over a new laptop. But millions of families in developing countries are increasing their incomes and are reaching the point of being able to buy a computer.  And despite falling Windows sales, Microsoft’s Office sold well in the second quarter, underscoring the importance of PCs to corporations, something unlikely to change radically soon.  For now, investors should heed Intel’s consistently estimate-beating quarterly results and not sell the company’s stock based on worries about what the PC market and mobile markets will look like in a decade, Berenbaum argued.  “What’s going to happen in 10 years? I have no idea, but the market doesn’t know either and the market isn’t going to be able to discount what’s going to happen in 10 years. This market can barely discount 10 minutes,” Berenbaum said.

34,INTC,UPDATE 3-Air Products profit and outlook tepid; stock falls," * Fiscal Q3 adj EPS $1.46 matches Street expectations   * Revenue up 15 percent at $2.58 billion   * Forecasts fiscal Q4 profit in range mostly below Street   * CEO says ‘very disappointed’ with results in main units   * Shares down 2.4 percent  (Adds CFO comments, electronics context; updates stock)   By Ernest Scheyder   NEW YORK, July 22 (Reuters) - Operational challenges and higher costs hampered Air Products and Chemicals Inc’s (APD.N) quarterly profit and led executives to forecast a tepid fiscal fourth quarter, pushing the company’s stock down 2.4 percent.   Air Products, which supplies argon, oxygen and other industrial gases to retail, manufacturing and construction customers, said its operations in North America remain the weakest, hurt by lackluster consumer demand and uncertainty about U.S economic policy.   “The economy in North America has kind of hit a soft patch,” Chief Financial Officer Paul Huck said on a conference call with reporters. “There’s still a lot of uncertainty around there.”   Asian growth remains strong, and the company plans to increase its capital spending there, Huck said.   The Air Products results came on the same day that manufacturing giants Honeywell Inc (HON.N) and Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) issued weak forecasts. [ID:nN1E76L01M] [ID:nN1E76L04K]   Planned customer plant shutdowns during the fiscal third quarter dented Air Products’ tonnage business, which operates industrial gas facilities on-site for customers.   Higher costs ate into the merchant business, which supplies industrial gas for retail and construction customers.   Chief Executive John McGlade said he was “very disappointed” about the weak performance.   “With the Tonnage planned maintenance outages behind us and the actions we are taking to improve Merchant performance, we expect margins to improve significantly” in the current quarter, McGlade said in a statement.   Mixed results could continue, the company said. Air Products forecast a profit of $1.48 to $1.53 per share for the current quarter. Analysts expect $1.52.   “As uncertainties surrounding policy, fiscal and sovereign debt issues begin to resolve over the coming months, we would expect growth to pick up early in our fiscal 2012,” said Huck.   For the third quarter, ended June 30, the company posted net income of $326.5 million, or $1.50 per share, compared with $253.2 million, or $1.17 per share, a year earlier.   Excluding a gain from the sale of its healthcare business in 2009, Air Products earned $1.46 per share. That met analysts’ expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   Revenue rose 15 percent to $2.58 billion. Analysts expected $2.53 billion.   Sales to electronics customers showed the fastest growth, up 21 percent to $602 million.   The electronics segment, which supplies gases that Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Intel Corp (INTC.O) use to make their popular products, should continue to grow, Huck said.   “We expect continued strong performance from this segment,” he said.   Air Products walked away from a planned $5.9 billion buyout of smaller rival Airgas Inc ARG.N earlier this year. [ID:nN15128419]   Shares of Air Products were down 2.4 percent to $93.16 in midday trading. The stock has traded between $69.89 and $98.00 in the past 52 weeks.

36,INTC,Economic jitters threaten holiday chip cheer,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Makers of chips for TVs, game consoles and other consumer electronics aren’t expecting much for Christmas, but insatiable demand for high-end gadgets like Apple’s iPad will likely deliver some cheer.  Texas Instruments, Intel and Qualcomm are normally busy this time of year churning out microchips for consumer electronics — typically the hottest tickets during the annual holiday season from November to December.  But persistently high U.S. unemployment and the risk of further economic slowdown, along with the danger of a European financial crisis, have soured many manufacturers’ moods, according to a growing chorus of chip executives.  Even blockbuster expectations for smartphones have cooled slightly.  “Wherever we look right now there’s macroeconomic uncertainty,” ARM Holdings Chief Executive Warren East told analysts on a conference call on Tuesday. “There is uncertainty about consumer expenditure.”  Cambridge, England-based ARM, whose chip technology is widely used in smartphones and tablets, warned that an uptick in chip manufacturing typically seen ahead of Christmas might be smaller than normal this year.  “Consumer spending is cautious,” said Longbow Research analyst JoAnne Feeney. “(Product manufacturers) are in a wait-and-see holding pattern. They want to see whether demand materializes before they build more televisions, set-top boxes and cameras.”  Last week, Intel cut its outlook for 2011 PC shipments and said growth would come from China and other emerging markets instead of the United States or Europe.  3M Co said on Tuesday its display and graphics segment fell in the June quarter, reflecting less demand for LCD TVs and a tighter consumer electronics market.  Because many of its products are low-cost, quickly used and sold all over the world, 3M is a barometer of global industrial health.  Texas Instruments said on Monday computing and consumer electronics customers concerned about the economy were ordering fewer chips than usual for this time of year. It said store shelves could fill up later than usual this holiday shopping season.  As well as tough economic times, ripples from Japan’s earthquake in March are still affecting the industry.  Electronics manufacturers that deliberately ordered extra components following the disaster are now less worried about shortages and are beginning to work through their inventories, leading to fewer new orders, said CLSA analyst Srini Pajjuri.  Consumer appetite for Apple’s smartphones is as strong as ever, but growth at competitors like Nokia, Research in Motion and LG Electronics has faltered.  And a slew of tablets meant to compete with the iPad have failed to take off, adding to inventories of chips that had been manufactured in anticipation of higher sales but have gone unused.  “Demand for smartphones and tablets is OK, but it’s not as good as people were thinking,” said MKM Partners analyst Daniel Berenbaum. “Plus smartphones and feature phones have a big headwind in Europe, which is a very important market.”  Smartphone shipments this year will grow about 38 percent, according to market research firm IHS iSuppli. Analysts earlier this year had forecast expansion of around 50 percent.  Shares of Broadcom, which makes Bluetooth and other wireless chips and counts Apple as a key customer, soared 9 percent after the Irvine, California company gave a rosier-than-expected quarterly outlook.  Some investors expect larger wireless chipmaker Qualcomm to supply key chips for Apple’s next iPhone and to continue to increase its content in Apple’s devices.  Qualcomm last week raised its guidance for the current quarter, although Chief Financial Officer William Keitel warned that economic uncertainty was making customers “extra judicious”.  Chipmakers that do their own manufacturing, instead of contracting it out, and that have inventories on hand, may be able to respond in time to any last-minute holiday orders should the outlook for consumer demand improve.  Texas Instruments has said there is still time to ramp up ahead of the year-end shopping season and that its factories will be ready if demand improves.  “Christmas could still come if consumers indicate they’re going to spend, Longbow’s Feeney said.

40,INTC,UPDATE 2-ARM cautious on Christmas holiday sales," * Q2 sales, profit beats expectations   * Sees sequential rise in industry revenue in current quarter   * Says Q4 harder to predict due to worries on consumer confidence   * Shares reverse early gains, down 2.2 pct   (Adds CEO comments, analyst reaction, shares)	   By Paul Sandle	   LONDON, July 26 (Reuters) - ARM Holdings sounded a note of caution about electronic goods sales this coming Christmas, overshadowing a better-than-expected second-quarter where its technology, already dominant in mobile phones and tablets, was licensed for more and more uses.	   The Cambridge-based company, whose processor designs are used by Samsung Electronics , Qualcomm and Texas Instruments , sold 29 licenses in the quarter, helping pretax profit rise 25 percent to 54.2 million pounds ($88.3 million) on 18 percent higher revenue of 117.8 million pounds.	   ARM said it expected industry revenue in the second quarter, which drives its third-quarter royalties, to tick up quarter-on-quarter, but it kept forecasts for the year unchanged, indicating less confidence on sales ahead of the key Christmas period.	   “There’s obviously a number of broad macro economic uncertainties that make us cautious as to whether the normal seasonal uptick you see at the end of the year, ahead of Christmas, is as significant as it had been in some other years,” Finance Director Tim Score told reporters on Tuesday. 	   Shares in the company rose as much as 2.6 percent as the market welcomed strong license sales, before reversing the gains on worries about consumer spending.	   They were 2.4 percent lower at 601.5 pence by 0907 GMT, underperforming a 0.2 percent weaker FTSE 100 index . 	   Analyst Paul Morland at Peel Hunt said the results were “excellent”, but with the shares trading at 54 times this year’s earnings, they were vulnerable to a set of quarterly results that did not meet the market’s high expectations.	   “With royalties recognised one quarter in arrears and several semi stocks recently reporting something of a slowdown for Q3, there is a risk that Q4 could be a disappointing quarter for ARM,” he said.	   Score said the strong license sales would drive future royalties as ARM chips were designed into products ranging from cars, air conditioners and running machines to smartphones and computers.	   “We are building that installed license base quicker than we ever have done in the past,” he said.	   ARM shipped 1.1 billion processors based on its architecture in smartphones and tablets, including Apple’s iPhone and iPad, in the quarter. Sales of its chips in smartphones tend to deliver the biggest royalty payments for the company.	   But while consumers’ appetite for Apple’s products is as strong as ever, growth at competing handset makers such as Nokia  , Research in Motion , and LG has faltered. 	   Score said increasing competition among smartphone makers would be good for ARM even if average selling prices of chips fell.	   “The more competitive the environment the better it is for the ARM business,” he said. “We don’t try to pick winners, we try to enable the field. The chipmakers that win will end up paying us the most royalties.”	   ARM is also eyeing the PC and eventually server markets, which are the strongholds of Intel. 	   Microsoft is already designing the next generation of Windows software for ARM-based processors, and a number of manufacturers are planning ARM-based notebooks running Google’s  Chrome operating system later this year.	   “The computing space generally is a longer-term opportunity for us in terms of meaningful royalties,” Score said. “For those to come through the building blocks need to be being put in place now.”	   Analysts had expected the group to report pretax profit of 45.3 million pounds on revenue of 109.1 million pounds.

42,INTC,Infineon profits jump on strong car industry demand,"HELSINKI (Reuters) - German chipmaker Infineon Technologies AG reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit and sales on strong demand from automotive and industrial customers.  Infineon forecast sales in the current quarter to be the same or better than the last quarter while operating profit would be flat. This contrasted with its peers which have recently forecast weaker sales due to sluggish consumer demand.  Infineon, which makes chips for products ranging from cars to electronic passports, said its fiscal third-quarter sales rose 5 percent to 1.04 billion euros ($1.5 billion), while net profit jumped 51 percent from a year ago to 190 million.  “These are good results,” said a trader in Frankfurt.  Analysts on average expected revenue of 1.01 billion euros in the quarter, while their net profit estimates ranged from 156 million to 189 million, according to a Reuters poll.  Shares in the company opened higher, but later dropped after failing to break through a resistance level. Shares were 2.8 percent lower at 7 euros by 1240 GMT, while the blue-chip DAX index was down 1.5 percent, with only a handful of gainers.  “At its daily high the stock touched the 200-day moving average but it did not surpass the resistance level,” a Frankfurt-based trader said.  Infineon said sales and profits at its automotive unit were not significantly hit by disruptions within the automotive supply chain after the Japan earthquake.  Infineon is Europe’s biggest supplier of automotive chips, which are found in two out of three cars worldwide, used for anything from fuel injection to power management for electric cars. The autos segment generates 40 percent of its sales.  German carmakers Volkswagen and Daimler have reported a sharp rise in sales mainly thanks to a surge in demand in emerging markets.  Infineon said the quarterly forecast implied a slight hike in its outlook for the full-year through September, with sales now seen up more than 20 percent and the profit margin roughly at 20 percent. It had earlier forecast 20 percent sales growth with a 19.8 percent margin.  Despite strong earnings from Intel and Freescale, concerns over the financial crisis in Europe, higher inventories and sluggish PC sales have weighed on chip stocks.  Earlier this week Infineon’s larger European rival STMicroelectronics warned its revenue could slip in the three months to end-September.  Infineon was spun off from engineering group Siemens more than a decade ago and last year chose to exit the mobile chip business by selling its wireless chip unit to Intel.  It has since decided to focus on three areas — automotive, industrial & multimarket and chip card security — to reduce its exposure to volatile consumer trends.  “We believe that today’s report will be a further step in convincing the market that Infineon has become a less volatile and more reliable player in the semiconductor market,” said Silvia Quandt analyst Eerik Budarz.  Infineon also said it decided to invest some 250 million euros by 2014 in Dresden, Germany to set up a plant for mass manufacturing of power semiconductors on 300 millimeter wafers.

44,INTC,Exclusive: Nine Google complainants in EU probe,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Google faces a total of nine antitrust complaints which EU regulators are now investigating, two sources said on Tuesday, as rivals ramped up the pressure on the world No. 1 search engine.  The European Commission has up to now only confirmed four cases against Google. The addition of fresh complaints could broaden the EU watchdog’s ongoing probe and pile pressure on the company to strike a settlement.  “The Commission has nine formal complaints now. The new complaints come from small companies,” said one of the sources who declined to provide details because of the sensitivity of the matter.  The second source said three cases came from national regulators while two were fresh complaints.  The Commission said it had nothing to add and Google could not be reached for comment.  The increased number of complaints underscores Google’s dominant position but does not necessarily mean bad news for the company, said Simon Holmes, head of EU and competition law at law firm SJ Berwin.  “Google’s strong position means there are lots of interests involved. But there is nothing wrong per se in having a strong position,” he said.  “The mere proliferation of complaints doesn’t increase the likelihood of infringements. It means there are issues certain parties want to be investigated.”  The Commission opened an investigation into Google in November last year following allegations by three small companies that Google demoted their sites in Web search engines because they were rivals.  Microsoft ratcheted up its rivalry with Google by filing its first-ever complaint to the EU watchdog in March this year, claiming that Google systematically blocked Internet search competition.  The Commission can fine companies up to 10 percent of their global turnover for breaching EU rules. It has in recent years imposed billion-euro penalties on Microsoft and Intel for anticompetitive behavior.  The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is also investigating Google following accusations that it abused its market dominance. The U.S. Senate’s antitrust panel will hold a hearing on Google’s market clout on September 21.

45,INTC,"""State actor"" behind slew of cyber attacks","BOSTON (Reuters) - Security experts have discovered an unprecedented series of cyber attacks on the networks of 72 organizations globally, including the United Nations, governments and corporations, over a five-year period.  Security company McAfee, which uncovered the intrusions, said it believed there was one “state actor” behind the attacks but declined to name it, though several other security experts said the evidence points to China.  The long list of victims in the extended campaign include the governments of the United States, Taiwan, India, South Korea, Vietnam and Canada; the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN); the International Olympic Committee (IOC); the World Anti-Doping Agency; and an array of companies, from defense contractors to high-tech enterprises.  In the case of the United Nations, the hackers broke into the computer system of its secretariat in Geneva in 2008, hid there for nearly two years, and quietly combed through reams of secret data, according to McAfee.  “Even we were surprised by the enormous diversity of the victim organizations and were taken aback by the audacity of the perpetrators,” McAfee’s vice president of threat research, Dmitri Alperovitch, wrote in a 14-page report released on Wednesday.  “What is happening to all this data ... is still largely an open question. However, if even a fraction of it is used to build better competing products or beat a competitor at a key negotiation (due to having stolen the other team’s playbook), the loss represents a massive economic threat.”  McAfee learned of the extent of the hacking campaign in March this year, when its researchers discovered logs of the attacks while reviewing the contents of a “command and control” server that they had discovered in 2009 as part of an investigation into security breaches at defense companies.  It dubbed the attacks “Operation Shady RAT” and said the earliest breaches date back to mid-2006, though there might have been other intrusions. (RAT stands for “remote access tool,” a type of software that hackers and security experts use to access computer networks from afar).  Some of the attacks lasted just a month, but the longest — on the Olympic Committee of an unidentified Asian nation — went on and off for 28 months, according to McAfee.  “Companies and government agencies are getting raped and pillaged every day. They are losing economic advantage and national secrets to unscrupulous competitors,” Alperovitch told Reuters.  “This is the biggest transfer of wealth in terms of intellectual property in history,” he said. “The scale at which this is occurring is really, really frightening.”  Alperovitch said that McAfee had notified all 72 victims of the attacks, which are under investigation by law enforcement agencies around the world. He declined to give more details.  Jim Lewis, a cyber expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said it was very likely China was behind the campaign because some of the targets had information that would be of particular interest to Beijing.  The systems of the IOC and several national Olympic Committees were breached before the 2008 Beijing Games. And China views Taiwan as a renegade province, and political issues between them remain contentious even as economic ties have strengthened in recent years.  “Everything points to China. It could be the Russians, but there is more that points to China than Russia,” Lewis said.  McAfee, acquired by Intel Corp this year, would not comment on whether China was responsible.  There was no comment from China on the report.  The U.N. said it was aware of the report, and had started an investigation to ascertain if there was an intrusion.  A U.S. Defense Department spokeswoman, Air Force Lieutenant Colonel April Cunningham, said “it is unknown who is perpetrating these intrusions.”  “With regard to China, we reported to Congress in 2010 that China is actively pursuing cyber capabilities with a focus on the exfiltration of information, some of which could be of strategic or military utility,” Cunningham said.  White House spokesman Jay Carney declined to comment on the report’s findings but said U.S. President Barack Obama viewed cybersecurity as a top priority and was working to tighten the defenses of both the government and private sector.  U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said, “We obviously will evaluate it, look at it and pursue what needs to be pursued in terms of its content.”  Britain’s electronic spy agency told Reuters the McAfee report highlighted the need for international cooperation as cyber security challenges were transnational.  “Attribution for attacks in cyberspace is always difficult. But whoever is responsible, this report is another reminder of the need for effective cyber-security,” said a spokeswoman for the Government Communications Headquarters, one of the three main arms of British intelligence.  Vijay Mukhi, a cyber-expert based in India, said some South Asian governments were highly vulnerable to hacking from China.  “I’m not surprised because that’s what China does, they are gradually dominating the cyberworld,” he said. “I would call it child’s play (for a hacker to get access to Indian government data) ... I would say we’re in the stone age.”  In Taiwan, an official of the Criminal Investigation Bureau, which has a cyber crime unit, said he had no knowledge of the McAfee report but added there had been no cases in recent years of hacking of government websites.  An official from the Japanese trade ministry’s information security policy team said it was difficult to determine whether a specific government lay behind a cyber attack “although we see which countries the attacks originate from.”  McAfee released the report to coincide with the start of the Black Hat conference in Las Vegas, an annual meeting of security professionals who promote security and fight cyber crime.

The UN said it was aware of the report, and that it has started an investigation to ascertain if there was an intrusion.    “The  idea is to look into the entire Geneva network,” said Farhan Haq, Deputy Spokesperson for the UN Secretary-General, adding that it was difficult to quantify the potential damage without  knowing exactly what had been attacked.    He declined to be drawn on who might be behind the attacks. When asked what would happen if it  turned out to be China, he said: “We’ll have to cross that bridge once we find out what happened to our network.”    McAfee released the report to coincide with the start of the Black Hat conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday, an annual gathering of security professionals and hackers who use their skills to promote security and fight cyber crime.   In the scorching desert heat, they will meet to talk about a series of recent headline-grabbing hacks, such as on Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), the International Monetary Fund, Citigroup Inc (C.N), Sony Corp (6758.T) and EMC Corp’s EMC.N RSA Security.   Experts will disclose security vulnerabilities in commonly used software, computers, services and electronics to help companies and governments combat criminal hackers.   The activist groups Anonymous and Lulz Security have recently grabbed the spotlight for temporarily shutting down some high-profile websites and defacing others.   But attacks like Operation Shady RAT are far more costly and often undisclosed, as victims fear reputational damage or attention from other hackers. McAfee sees Operation Shady RAT as the tip of the iceberg.   “I am convinced that every company in every conceivable industry with significant size and valuable intellectual property and trade secrets has been compromised (or will be shortly), with the great majority of the victims rarely discovering the intrusion or its impact,” Alperovitch wrote in the report.   “In fact, I divide the entire set of Fortune Global 2000 firms into two categories: those that know they’ve been compromised and those that don’t yet know.”  (Additional reporting from Tom Miles in Geneva, editing by Tiffany Wu, Martin Howell)  ",8032011,http://www.reuters.com/article/cyberattacks/biggest-ever-series-of-cyber-attacks-uncovered-un-hit-idUSN1E76R26720110803

Security company McAfee, which uncovered the intrusions, said it believed there was one “state actor” behind the attacks but declined to name it, though several other security experts said the evidence points to China.   The long list of victims in the extended campaign include the governments of the United States, Taiwan, India, South Korea, Vietnam and Canada; the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN); the International Olympic Committee (IOC); the World Anti-Doping Agency; and an array of companies, from defense contractors to high-tech enterprises.   In the case of the United Nations, the hackers broke into the computer system of its secretariat in Geneva in 2008, hid there for nearly two years, and quietly combed through reams of secret data, according to McAfee.   “Even we were surprised by the enormous diversity of the victim organizations and were taken aback by the audacity of the perpetrators,” McAfee’s vice president of threat research, Dmitri Alperovitch, wrote in a 14-page report released on Wednesday.   “What is happening to all this data ... is still largely an open question. However, if even a fraction of it is used to build better competing products or beat a competitor at a key negotiation (due to having stolen the other team’s playbook), the loss represents a massive economic threat.”   <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   Q+A on Operation Shady RAT:                [ID:nN1E76R22Q]   Graphic on cyber attacks:   link.reuters.com/buh92s  Timeline of attacks:           r.reuters.com/vem92s  List of victims:               r.reuters.com/wyj92s  Reuters Insider shows:      link.reuters.com/neg92s  link.reuters.com/bam92s  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>   McAfee learned of the extent of the hacking campaign in March this year, when its researchers discovered logs of the attacks while reviewing the contents of a “command and control” server that they had discovered in 2009 as part of an investigation into security breaches at defense companies.   It dubbed the attacks “Operation Shady RAT” and said the earliest breaches date back to mid-2006, though there might have been other intrusions. (RAT stands for “remote access tool,” a type of software that hackers and security experts use to access computer networks from afar).   Some of the attacks lasted just a month, but the longest — on the Olympic Committee of an unidentified Asian nation — went on and off for 28 months, according to McAfee.   “Companies and government agencies are getting raped and pillaged every day. They are losing economic advantage and national secrets to unscrupulous competitors,” Alperovitch told Reuters.   “This is the biggest transfer of wealth in terms of intellectual property in history,” he said. “The scale at which this is occurring is really, really frightening.”   Alperovitch said that McAfee had notified all 72 victims of the attacks, which are under investigation by law enforcement agencies around the world. He declined to give more details.   Jim Lewis, a cyber expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said it was very likely China was behind the campaign because some of the targets had information that would be of particular interest to Beijing.   The systems of the IOC and several national Olympic Committees were breached before the 2008 Beijing Games. And China views Taiwan as a renegade province, and political issues between them remain contentious even as economic ties have strengthened in recent years.   “Everything points to China. It could be the Russians, but there is more that points to China than Russia,” Lewis said.   McAfee, acquired by Intel Corp (INTC.O) this year, would not comment on whether China was responsible.   There was no comment from China on the report.   The U.N. said it was aware of the report, and had started an investigation to ascertain if there was an intrusion.   White House spokesman Jay Carney declined to comment on the report’s findings but said U.S. President Barack Obama viewed cybersecurity as a top priority and was working to tighten the defenses of both the government and private sector.   U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said, “We obviously will evaluate it, look at it and pursue what needs to be pursued in terms of its content.”   Britain’s electronic spy agency told Reuters the McAfee report highlighted the need for international cooperation as cyber security challenges were transnational.   “Attribution for attacks in cyberspace is always difficult. But whoever is responsible, this report is another reminder of the need for effective cyber-security,” said a spokeswoman for the Government Communications Headquarters, one of the three main arms of British intelligence. [ID:nL6E7J326R]   Vijay Mukhi, a cyber-expert based in India, said some South Asian governments were highly vulnerable to hacking from China.   “I’m not surprised because that’s what China does, they are gradually dominating the cyberworld,” he said. “I would call it child’s play (for a hacker to get access to Indian government data) ... I would say we’re in the stone age.”   In Taiwan, an official of the Criminal Investigation Bureau, which has a cyber crime unit, said he had no knowledge of the McAfee report but added there had been no cases in recent years of hacking of government websites.   An official from the Japanese trade ministry’s information security policy team said it was difficult to determine whether a specific government lay behind a cyber attack “although we see which countries the attacks originate from.”   McAfee released the report to coincide with the start of the Black Hat conference in Las Vegas, an annual meeting of security professionals who promote security and fight cyber crime.

Renee James, head of Intel’s software division, would not discuss pricing for the service, expected out before the end of the year, but said it would work on personal computers using Intel chips sold as long as five years ago.  “It will allow you to subscribe to an enhanced product that’s available to those machines,” James told Reuters in an interview on Friday.  “You’ll have great security from McAfee in software only, and if you have an Intel core laptop or ultrabook it’s going to be even more secure,” she said.  Intel bought McAfee earlier this year in a $7.7 billion deal meant to help the world’s top chipmaker offer more safety from hackers to customers using its chips.  Since then, a wave of high-profile hacking attacks against companies, including consumer electronics giant Sony,has underscored the growing risk to companies and consumers from online criminals.  Intel’s upcoming McAfee product will not include new tweaks to its processors or building security measures directly onto the chips, as some experts have said the company might do.  “We are taking advantage of existing features in silicon to build new software products that are more robust,” James said. “We are not embedding the software in the silicon and I want to be clear about that,” James said.

53,INTC,Hackers don't need movie magic to wreak havoc,"LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Evil hackers with state-of-the-art computers gain remote control of a power plant and blow it up, killing many people and threatening more mayhem if a huge ransom is not paid.  It’s a storyline straight out of a Hollywood action movie but those attending two of the world’s biggest hacking conferences this week learned that such a scenario is not as outlandish as one might think.  Some of the most alarming research released at the Black Hat and Defcon conferences in Las Vegas reveal vulnerabilities in aging computer systems that run power plants, chemical factories, water distribution systems and other industrial facilities around the globe.  Boutique research firm NSS Labs uncovered a “back door” in industrial control systems from Germany’s Siemens AG that could allow hackers to wreak havoc on nuclear power plants, oil and gas pipelines, water treatment systems, pharmaceuticals factories and other critical infrastructure.  The “back door” is an undocumented access point that lets someone remotely break into the system using widely available “telnet” communications software and a six-character password that is the same on all Siemens systems and cannot be changed.  “You get full control,” said NSS Labs Chief Executive Rick Moy. “Things could go boom. Pipelines could explode if the pressure isn’t monitored properly. Hazardous chemicals and fluids could leak out.”  Siemens spokesman Alexander Machowetz said the company was looking into the matter. “We are not aware of any real case of a hacker taking influence on a controller in one of our customer’s facilities,” he said.  The new research from NSS comes after the firm disclosed another security flaw to Siemens in May, which the German company said it addressed with a software update.  Last summer, researchers discovered the Stuxnet virus, a computer worm designed to attack the Siemens’ industrial control systems that operate complicated factory machinery, known as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition.  Stuxnet was used to attack a nuclear enrichment facility in Iran in a blow to the country’s nuclear program. Some experts have described Stuxnet as a “guided cyber missile” aimed at Iran’s atomic program.  Many industrial plants were built decades ago and then later hooked up to the Internet to make them more efficient. In the rush to embrace the Web, engineers left holes in their systems that hackers have started to exploit.  “They stayed away from the security community. They wanted to do it themselves. Now they are wide open,” said Rick Howard, general manager of VeriSign Inc’s iDefense division and one of the researchers speaking at Defcon on securing critical infrastructure.  Security experts from government agencies and big corporations attend the Black Hat and Defcon conferences every year, crowding into sessions alongside hackers, many of whom use their skills to promote security and fight cyber crime.  At meetings that run through Sunday, they talked about headline-grabbing attacks, such as the massive cyber espionage campaign disclosed by Intel’s McAfee security software unit, in which 72 organizations around the world were infiltrated.  Howard gave a presentation on Saturday on Stuxnet, the first piece of malicious software to surface that was designed to attack an industrial control system.  The U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned Congress last month that hackers likely are adapting the code in Stuxnet to build new weapons that could launch attacks on industrial control systems anywhere in the world.  Jerome Radcliffe, an expert on Stuxnet, said many of the passwords in such systems are hard-coded into the devices, meaning they cannot be changed. That makes makes them easy prey.  A diabetic, Radcliffe relies on a computer to measure his blood-sugar levels and dose him with insulin as needed. He hacked into that system and figured out a way to send it erroneous dosing instructions or order it to shut down.  He said hackers could use a similar approach to attack machines used to distribute water to millions of home.  “My insulin pump is a good human story,” Radcliffe said. “It’s a one-person deal. But if I could shut off the water for an entire city, that’s a disaster.”  Three other hackers say they worked out how to remotely open and close prison-cell doors. These systems are controlled by the same type of computers as many industrial control systems, known as PLCs, or programmable logic controllers.  The independent hackers conducted their research after spending just $500 to buy a used PLC on eBay and $2,000 for software from its manufacturer, Siemens. They identified security holes and discovered how to take advantage of them to launch an attack.  So far the hackers — a father-daughter pair and their friend — have not tested their theories on a real prison but toured one facility, which they declined to identify.  They said they saw a prison guard using the computer that controls the PLC to check his Google email, which could potentially give hackers a path to launch an attack.  “This is a real threat. It’s not something theoretical,” said one of the hackers, Tiffany Rad.

55,INTC,UPDATE 2-Intel CFO says view unshaken by US debt downgrade," * Sees emerging markets driving more growth   * Says PC supply chain remains lean   * Outlook uncertain for much of chipmarket  (Adds detail on Intel, background on industry)   By Noel Randewich and Peter Henderson   SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Intel’s chief financial officer said he does not expect S&P’s downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt to hurt business at the top personal computer chipmaker this quarter, despite a sharp sell-off on Wall Street on Monday.   Weeks before global Standard & Poor’s took the unprecedented step of downgrading U.S. debt, Intel trimmed its forecast for 2011 personal computer unit sales, warning of softness in mature markets but pointing to healthy expansion in China.   Families buying their first PCs in emerging markets, the source of half of Intel’s sales, are unlikely to put off their purchases because of troubles in the United States, CFO Stacy Smith said in an interview with Reuters on Monday.   “When your country is doing well, you know, you’re probably somewhat inoculated from some of the shocks going on elsewhere in the world,” he said.   Across the broader chip industry, uncertainty has grown in recent weeks. Unusually high U.S. unemployment and a deepening financial crisis in Europe have soured electronics manufacturers’ moods, a growing chorus of chip executives say.   Major chip companies like ARM Holdings ARM.L and Texas Instruments TXN.N have warned that spending during the crucial holiday season could fall well short of expectations. [ID:nN1E76P0SU]   Even blockbuster expectations for smartphones beyond Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) iPhones have cooled slightly.   Intel remains notably more optimistic about the PC industry’s prospects than many investors and executives in other parts of the electronics industry.   “I don’t think that the specifics of the debt downgrade of the U.S. changes the overall business trajectory that we’ve been seeing,” Smith said of Intel.   “The only forecast we put out there for the business level was Q3, and, yeah, nothing that’s happened in the last week or so changes my view of Q3,” he added, shortly after the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down more than 5.5 percent.   Last month, Intel forecast current-quarter revenue of about $14 billion, give or take $500 million, better than the $13.5 billion analysts had expected on average. [ID:nN1E76I25R]   Its shares are down almost 16 percent since hitting a year’s high in May, but that vastly outperformed the plunge of roughly 24 percent by the Philadelphia semiconductor index .SOX.   Intel, whose stock fell 3.27 percent on Monday, is not planning to start a new venture making chips for chip design companies, Smith said, knocking down speculation by some analysts.   “We have a couple of very small foundry deals ... but we have no plans to enter the foundry business,” he said.

56,INTC,"Financial advisers have ""black Monday"" blues","NEW YORK (Reuters) - For plenty of financial advisers — who also serve as quasi-therapists, spiritual gurus and confidantes — Monday was bad.  Really bad.  The S&P 500 posted its largest drop — more than 6 percent — in nearly three years, sparked by rising fears of a recession and fueled by the United States’ loss of its perfect triple-A credit rating. Panicked selling on heavy volume resulted in the S&P’s worst day since December 2008 — every stock in the benchmark index’s components ended the session in negative territory.  An adviser at a brokerage giant Merrill Lynch office in a Philadelphia suburb said the phones rang off the hook all day.  “Thank goodness for people who are on vacation and not calling in, although many are,” she said, asking not to be identified by name due to company policy. “Every call is too long. Tons of emails. Everyone doing conference calls, which are pretty much worthless.”  She turned down the television volume several times and “thought about putting on the Food Channel.”  Alan Haft, an independent financial adviser in Newport Beach, California, said his phone was buzzing with calls from clients wanting to “sell everything.”  “One calls saying the Mayan Calendar is coming true, that he’s absolutely certain this really is the beginning of the end of the world,” Haft said.  The eight money managers at Capital Investment Advisors in Atlanta started their day with an emergency 8 a.m. EDT meeting to review the situation. The good news? “We don’t think this is 2008,” said Mitch Reiner, chief operating officer at the firm.  Reiner said more aggressive clients took advantage of cheap prices, adding Intel, Procter & Gamble, Eli Lilly and other large-cap dividend stocks to their portfolios.  But one “very conservative client” wanted to know he wasn’t among the bargain hunters. Reiner’s response: “Because you can’t handle being down 3 percent.”  Trying to talk people off a ledge is never easy. Several advisers said it was even more difficult on Monday because they already talked clients off the ledge last week when the U.S. debt deal was sealed.  But several advisers who focus on long-term financial planning say their phones were quiet on Monday.  Richard Coppa, managing director at Wealth Health in Roseland, New Jersey, fielded just three calls from clients, “which honestly, is a good sign,” he said. And the clients he did connect with are “disgusted with our government, more than anything.” Added Patricia Powell, a certified financial planner at Powell Financial Group in Martinsville, New Jersey: “It is deadly quiet. I have not received a single client call or email about the markets today.”  One theory is that financial institutions are panicking more than retail investors. “My inbox is getting flooded with their “take” on the market slide, ratings downgrade, etc.,” said Ori Pagovich of Gotham Financial Services in New York. “Everyone either has a Webex, Webinar, white paper, update or anything in between on the events of the last two business days.”  With every big downturn comes opportunity, though.  “While clients are certainly concerned about recent market activity, they are not panicking; some have viewed the current pullback in the market as a potential buying opportunity,” said Joe Jennings, investment director for PNC Wealth Managementin Baltimore.  Monday was one of the heaviest trading days at ING Direct Investing. All told, the firm processed about 50,000 individual orders, which amounts to about 100 per minute, said Dan Greenshields, president of the ING Groep NV unit.  And there were more buyers than sellers who snapped up Apple and General Electric, along with several exchange-traded funds, such as SPDR S&P 500, SPDR Gold Trust and Powershares QQQ Trust.The bulk of that buying came from individuals aged 21 to 39. “People with long time horizons are buying,” Greenshields says.  Margaret Black-Scott, who is president and CEO of Beverly Hills Wealth Management, has been talking up Coke, Proctor & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson to her clients. It’s a variation on the mantra “know what you own” coined by Peter Lynch, the legendary manager of the Fidelity Magellan Fund.  “Take a look on your pantry shelf. What do you have there that you have to have?” said Black-Scott. “Do you drink lots of tea or coffee or eat breakfast cereal? There are lots of things we don’t need that are nice, and then there are lots of things we have to have.”  ",8082011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-crisis-advisers/financial-advisers-have-black-monday-blues-idUSTRE77769G20110808

And the clients he did connect with are “disgusted with our government, more than anything.” Added Patricia Powell, a certified financial planner at Powell Financial Group in Martinsville, New Jersey: “It is deadly quiet. I have not received a single client call or email about the markets today.”   One theory is that financial institutions are panicking more than retail investors. “My inbox is getting flooded with their “take” on the market slide, ratings downgrade, etc.,” said Ori Pagovich of Gotham Financial Services in New York. “Everyone either has a Webex, Webinar, white paper, update or anything in between on the events of the last two business days.”   With every big downturn comes opportunity, though.   “While clients are certainly concerned about recent market activity, they are not panicking; some have viewed the current pullback in the market as a potential buying opportunity,” said Joe Jennings, investment director for PNC Wealth Management (PNC.N)in Baltimore.   Monday was one of the heaviest trading days at ING Direct Investing  ING.AS. All told, the firm processed about 50,000 individual orders, which amounts to about 100 per minute, said Dan Greenshields, president of the ING Groep NV unit.   And there were more buyers than sellers who snapped up Apple (AAPL.O) and General Electric (GE.N), along with several exchange-traded funds, such as SPDR S&P 500 (SPY.P), SPDR Gold Trust (GLD.P) and Powershares QQQ Trust (QQQ.O).The bulk of that buying came from individuals aged 21 to 39. “People with long time horizons are buying,” Greenshields says.   Margaret Black-Scott, who is president and CEO of Beverly Hills Wealth Management, has been talking up Coke (KO.N), Proctor & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) to her clients. It’s a variation on the mantra “know what you own” coined by Peter Lynch, the legendary manager of the Fidelity Magellan Fund.   “Take a look on your pantry shelf. What do you have there that you have to have?” said Black-Scott. “Do you drink lots of tea or coffee or eat breakfast cereal? There are lots of things we don’t need that are nice, and then there are lots of things we have to have.”  (Edited by Jonathan Oatis)    ",8082011,http://www.reuters.com/article/crisis-advisers/refile-u-s-financial-advisers-have-black-monday-blues-idUSN1E77720L20110808

61,INTC,Tesla names automotive newcomers as Model S execs,"DETROIT (Reuters) - Tesla Motors named four executives, none from the automotive industry, to help the Silicon Valley company prepare for the mass production of its Model S car, which is due out in 2012.  Tesla on Tuesday said it appointed Ravi Simhambhatla as vice president of information technology and business applications, Greg Reichow as vice president of powertrain operations, Peter Carlsson as vice president of supply chain and John Hillegass as vice president of design and retail development.  Tesla plans to debut the Model S in mid-2012. It hopes that the sedan will widen its scope from being a niche brand that sells only the expensive Roadster sports car. The base model of the Model S will cost about $57,400 compared to the Roadster’s base price of $109,000, before a $7,500 federal tax credit and other rebates.  Reichow, who comes to Tesla from SunPower Corp, “will increase efficiency on Tesla’s existing lines and implement innovative processes for Tesla’s future vehicles,” the company said in a press statement.  Hillegass will help build Tesla’s retail store network after working for Pixar Studios, Stanford University, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, and Apple.  Simhambhatla was chief information officer at high service, low-cost airline Virgin America, and Carlsson comes from NXP Semiconductors.

63,INTC,UPDATE 3-Emerging markets comfort Intel CFO as stocks fall," * Sees emerging markets driving growth   * Says PC supply chain remains lean   * Outlook uncertain for much of chip market  (Rewrites first paragraph, adds detail on Intel, background)   By Noel Randewich and Peter Henderson   SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Intel’s business is on course despite the meltdown in global stock markets and U.S. sovereign debt downgrade, thanks to demand in developing markets, its chief financial officer said.   In sharp contrast to panicked investors who sent the Dow Jones down more than 5 percent on Monday, an unruffled Stacy Smith said consumers in booming economies like China and Brazil that now make up half of Intel’s sales were not scared by U.S. issues.   “When your country is doing well, you know, you’re probably somewhat inoculated from some of the shocks going on elsewhere in the world,” he said in an interview with Reuters on Monday.   Intel’s share price has bumped along at a low valuation for some time as investors have clamored for the Santa Clara, California company to move faster and more aggressively into mobile devices, like smartphones and tablets. Intel chips won’t be in smartphones before next year, for instance.   Smith, who himself carries three smartphones and also owns a tablet, insisted there were no signs of problems to make him change his business forecast. “Nothing that’s happened in the last week or so changes my view of Q3,” he added.   He spoke shortly after the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down more than 5.5 percent in reaction to S&P’s cut of the U.S. sovereign debt rating.   While analysts say the direct impact on the economy from the credit rating downgrade itself is limited, a sustained drop in share prices would have a negative impact on wealth, and likely force both consumers and businesses to hunker down.   A few weeks ago, Intel trimmed its forecast for 2011 personal computer unit sales, warning of softness in mature markets but pointing to healthy expansion in China.   Intel could see more signs of trouble later this month as its manufacturing customers gauge demand for the normally-busy back-to-school season.   “Things could materially change, not just for Intel but for many companies later in August depending on feedback the supply chain gets about back to school,” said Robert W Baird & Co analyst Tristan Gerra.   FIRST-TIME BUYERS   For years technology analysts predicted developing economies would leapfrog past desktop computers to buy thin, fast, Web-connected portables. Instead, Europeans and Americans have turned to the lighter devices while emerging market buyers have started off with robust PCs the whole family can use and that bring Intel big profits, Smith said.   Intel remains notably more optimistic about the PC industry’s prospects than many investors and executives in other parts of the electronics industry.   Major chip companies like ARM Holdings ARM.L and Texas Instruments TXN.N have warned that spending during the crucial holiday season could fall well short of expectations. [ID:nN1E76P0SU]   Even blockbuster expectations for smartphones beyond Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) iPhones have cooled slightly.   “I don’t think that the specifics of the debt downgrade of the U.S. changes the overall business trajectory that we’ve been seeing,” Smith said of Intel. He declined to discuss the outlook for the fourth quarter.   Last month, Intel forecast current-quarter revenue of about $14 billion, give or take $500 million, better than the $13.5 billion analysts had expected on average. [ID:nN1E76I25R]   Its shares are down almost 16 percent since hitting a year’s high in May, but that vastly outperformed the plunge of roughly 24 percent by the Philadelphia semiconductor index .SOX.   Intel, whose stock fell 3.27 percent on Monday, is not planning to start a new venture making chips for chip design companies, Smith said, knocking down speculation by some analysts.   “We have a couple of very small foundry deals ... but we have no plans to enter the foundry business,” he said.

64,INTC,Rajaratnam sentencing may be a fight to the death,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. government request that Galleon Group hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam spend as much as 24-1/2 years in prison — a term associated more with murder than financial crimes — raises the ante in the biggest individual insider trading case in a generation.  Whether Rajaratnam, like Ponzi schemer Bernard Madoff, deserves the type of sentence often given to drug kingpins and Mafia bosses comes down, fundamentally, to the strength of the case against him, and the assessment of his presiding judge.  “I think what he did was terrible, corrosive and harmful to the markets,” said James Cox, a securities law professor at Duke University. “At the same time, where are the bodies, where is the blood?”  Cox and other legal experts believe Rajaratnam will get a substantial sentence, but less than the prosecutors requested in a sentencing memorandum filed with the court on Tuesday.  Prosecutors said a 19-1/2 to 24-1/2 year term, reflecting nonbinding federal sentencing guidelines, is appropriate for Rajaratnam, a Sri Lankan-born former billionaire whom they called “the modern face of illegal insider trading.”  A Manhattan jury convicted Rajaratnam in May on 14 criminal counts for trading on tips from bankers, company directors and traders in eBay Inc (EBAY.O), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), Intel Corp (INTC.O) and other stocks, netting an illicit profit of $63.8 million over seven years.  U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell will pass sentence on September 27.  Rajaratnam’s lawyers asked for a term “substantially below” the guidelines range, citing their 54-year-old client’s otherwise “exemplary” life and philanthropic efforts, and the “unique constellation of ailments ravaging his body.” A long prison term, they said, would amount to a “death sentence.”  There is no parole in the federal prison system, though a sentence can be reduced by 15 percent for good behavior.  Created in 1984, the sentencing guidelines have long been criticized as too severe, even draconian, for their emphasis on the size of crimes.  In 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court declared them “advisory” to avoid a conflict with the Constitution.  The next year, Holwell’s colleague, Judge Jed Rakoff, criticized the guidelines as he imposed a 3 1/2-year prison term on Richard Adelson, a former chief operating officer of Impath Inc, for overstating results of the cancer diagnosis testing company. Prosecutors sought 85 years, which was permitted under the guidelines.  There can be an “utter travesty of justice that sometimes results from the guidelines’ fetish with abstract arithmetic, as well as the harm that guideline calculations can visit on human beings if not cabined by common sense,” Rakoff wrote.  Twenty-four years is a long time. A person finishing such a term today would have entered prison when Ronald Reagan was U.S. president, Margaret Thatcher was Britain’s prime minister, and actress Lindsay Lohan was a year old.  U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara is seeking a prison term that exceeds some of the longest in earlier insider trading cases.  The financier Michael Milken, for example, was sentenced to 10 years in prison after pleading guilty in 1990. Former Credit Suisse Group AG CSGN.VX banker Hafiz Naseem got the same term in 2008 over a $7.5 million scheme.  Other financial criminals got more time behind bars.  In 2009, Madoff got 150 years for his Ponzi scheme, while the lawyer Marc Dreier got 20 years for his own. The guidelines called for 145 years in prison for Dreier.  Former WorldCom Inc chief Bernard Ebbers got 25 years and former Enron Corp chief Jeffrey Skilling got 24 years for their roles in accounting frauds.  Federal judges in Manhattan regularly impose shorter sentences on insider trading defendants than the guidelines recommend, including 13 of 15 in cases brought by Bharara’s office in 2009 and 2010.  That trend is continuing. Rakoff on July 29 imposed a 2-1/2-year term on former SAC Capital Advisors LP portfolio manager Donald Longueuil, who, he predicted, “in the fullness of time, will lead a productive and useful life.” Prosecutors sought four to five years under the guidelines.  Holwell is part of that trend. Last November, he sentenced Ali Hariri, a former vice president of chipmaker Atheros Communications Inc, to 1-1/2 years in prison. Prosecutors wanted two to 2-1/2 years under the guidelines.  And on July 20, Holwell sentenced Rajaratnam’s one-time co-defendant Danielle Chiesi, a former New Castle Funds trader, to 2-1/2 years in prison. Prosecutors wanted three to four years, but Holwell said substituting community service for some prison time would help Chiesi “adjust her moral compass.”  On the other hand, at Chiesi’s sentencing, Holwell gave Wall Street what he called a “loud and clear” warning that people who commit insider trading will be caught, and if convicted, will go to prison.  And Rajaratnam has fought the government from the beginning. That makes him unlike Longueuil and Chiesi, who may have gotten shorter sentences in part because they pleaded guilty.  Prosecutors said that a long sentence is just punishment for Rajaratnam’s “brazen, arrogant, harmful and pervasive” criminal conduct, some of which they memorialized in recorded phone calls played to jurors at the trial.  Rajaratnam is expected to appeal the admission of wiretaps, new to insider trading cases, as evidence. He is also challenging the conviction.  While legal experts agree that Rajaratnam will get a substantial sentence, they disagree on the length.  “The judge will be motivated not so much by the high-profile nature of the case, but by the evidence,” said Solomon Wisenberg, co-chairman of the white-collar defense practice at Barnes & Thornburg in Washington, D.C., and author of “White Collar Crime: Securities Fraud.”  Gerald Lefcourt, a former president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, is among those who argue that Rajaratnam’s case is unusual given “the breadth of the crime and the number of people involved.”  “While the defense may argue that the crime of insider trading is less harmful to individuals than crimes by officials at public companies, confidence in the markets is crucial to capitalism,” Lefcourt said.  Lefcourt predicts Holwell will reaffirm his message to Wall Street by imposing a 15- to 20-year prison term on Rajaratnam.  Cox meanwhile said a six- to eight-year term, together with a substantial monetary penalty, might send the right message.  And he added that it appears “very clear” that Wall Street should have learned its lesson.

66,INTC,Congresswoman eyes McAfee briefing on cyber attacks,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A congresswoman on Wednesday requested more information on security company McAfee’s report detailing a five-year hacking campaign that breached 72 organizations globally.  Representative Mary Bono Mack, chairman of the House Commerce subcommittee with jurisdiction over cybersecurity, said she was alarmed by the report on a slew of cyber attacks that McAfee has dubbed “Operation Shady RAT.”  In a letter to Dmitri Alperovitch, vice president of threat research for McAfee and author of the report, Bono Mack requested a briefing with his research team and asked how the government and private sector could more effectively mitigate data breaches.

Representative Mary Bono Mack, chairman of the House Commerce subcommittee with jurisdiction over cybersecurity, said she was alarmed by the report on a slew of cyber attacks that McAfee has dubbed “Operation Shady RAT.”   In a letter to Dmitri Alperovitch, vice president of threat research for McAfee and author of the report, Bono Mack requested a briefing with his research team and asked how the government and private sector could more effectively mitigate data breaches.

69,INTC,Intel expects Ultrabook PCs priced below $999 in Q4,"TAIPEI/BANGALORE (Reuters) - Top chipmaker Intel Corp said computer makers Lenovo, Asustek and Acer will launch its new category of notebook computer in the third to fourth quarter, and expects to see their prices below $999 in the fourth quarter.  Intel Capital, Intel’s global investment arm, will create a $300 million fund to invest in companies building hardware and software technologies for the new category of PCs known as Ultrabook.  “We are working very hard to bring the Ultrabook into the main stream...the prices will come down over time,” Erik Reid, Intel’s PC Client Group General Manager of Mobile Platforms Division, told a press conference in Taipei on Thursday.  Ultrabooks, launched by Intel in late May, will be lightweight but still pack high-performance processors. Intel sees them accounting for 40 percent of laptop sales to consumers by the end of next year.  Reid said Ultrabooks will also focus on the enterprise market and Intel is working with partners such as Dell and HP to launch the notebooks. However, the transition usually first happens in the consumer market, Reid said.  Santa Clara, California-based Intel is eager to make laptops more attractive to consumers who are increasingly captivated by Apple’s iPad and other mobile gadgets.  Speaking on the new PE fund, Intel Capital Managing Director David Flanagan told reporters that the investment will be made over the next 3-4 years in companies that help deliver slim components and platform technologies, longer battery life and new user experience.  He did not specify how much the fund plans to invest in Asia, but said Asia has a big potential for investment, given the large number of manufacturers in the region.  Besides the latest Ultrabook fund, Intel Capital has a number of dedicated funds in specific technology areas. Past technology-specific funds have included the Intel Digital Home Fund and Intel Communications Fund.  Last month, Intel Corp, which dominates the PC microchip industry but is struggling in a fast-expanding mobile market, warned that PC sales will not be as strong as it had expected this year and it expected PC unit growth at around 8 to 10 percent this year.

73,INTC,UPDATE 4-Mosaid deal would create global patent power-WiLan,"   * Mosaid says studying offer, investors should wait   * WiLan offer is at 20 premium to Mosaid’s Wednesday close   * WiLan says would still have significant cash after deal   * Secretive nature makes Mosaid valuation hard-analyst  (Adds interview with CEO, analyst comments, closing share prices)   By Alastair Sharp and Pav Jordan   TORONTO, Aug 18 (Reuters) - A proposed combination of two Canadian patent-holding companies would make it easier to extract lucrative licensing deals from technology giants in areas ranging from wireless to semiconductors, would-be buyer WiLan WIN.TO said on Thursday.   In fact, the race among tech giants to scoop up intellectual property to protect their businesses is heating up so much that WiLan may not be the only bidder for Mosaid’s MSD.TO patent portfolio, present in all Wi-Fi-enabled devices.   “I can’t predict who in the patent world might make a bid. It could be anybody, it could be nobody,” WiLan Chief Executive Jim Skippen told Reuters in an interview.   And if the bid for Mosaid is successful, Skippen said WiLan could soon be facing an unsolicited bid of its own.   “I think that a combined company will be very attractive, whether for investors or whether as an acquisition. It’s going to be very valuable so it wouldn’t shock me if somebody down the road tried to buy the combined company.”   WiLan, which makes money by developing and licensing intellectual property for the communications and consumer electronics markets, has offered C$38 a share for Mosaid just as tech majors increasingly pay huge sums for patents to use as weapons in litigation and cross-licensing. [ID:nN1E77G1WU]   The unsolicited offer values Mosaid at C$480 million, with a 20 percent premium to Wednesday’s closing share price.   Mosaid asked shareholders on Thursday to take no immediate action on the offer.   The companies know each other well and are practically neighbors in Ottawa. Skippen was Mosaid’s senior vice-president for patent licensing and general counsel before leaving in 2006 to reinvigorate WiLan.   “I’m in a very unique position to know an awful lot about the company without doing due diligence,” Skippen said.   The perceived value of patents has skyrocketed in recent months. Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Research In Motion RIM.TO and others paid $4.5 billion in July to thwart Google’s (GOOG.O) attempt to snare thousands of bankrupt Nortel’s patents. [ID:nNL3E7I10H]   Google, needing to beef up its patent portfolio to protect its Android mobile phone software from legal attack, said on Monday it would pay $12.5 billion for Motorola Mobility (MMI.N) to gain access to one of the mobile phone industry’s largest patent libraries. [ID:nL3E7JF1LD]   Two-thirds of Mosaid’s revenue stems from licenses relating to semiconductors and memory, while it has a growing wireless licensing business focused on short-distance Wi-Fi technology.   WiLan has settled a string of legal battles this year with companies it says were using its patented technology without paying licensing fees, including Intel (INTC.O), Cisco Systems (CSCO.O) and Texas Instruments TXN.N.   Skippen is confident the combined company can come to terms with companies like Intel and Cisco that have signed deals with WiLan and are being sued by Mosaid.   Since the terms of settlements are typically confidential, analysts say it is hard to value Mosaid’s worth.   “The reality is that most patents are worthless, some are worth a fair bit, and a small number are worth a great deal,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Brian Piccioni said in a note to clients as he raised his price target on Mosaid to C$40 from C$32.   He also said the cost and hassle of valuing the portfolio might discourage others from launching a rival bid.   Shares in Mosaid jumped 24 percent to C$39.22 on Thursday, suggesting investors consider a higher bid or competing offer a possibility. WiLan shares were down 5.9 percent at C$6.67.   Both WiLan and Mosaid develop and acquire patents with the main aim of winning licensing deals from companies that use the technology, rather than using the intellectual property in their own products.   WiLan has approached Mosaid about a takeover several times over the last few years, most recently this week when Skippen informed them before announcing the latest proposal.   “The door is very much open and the ball is very much in their court,” said Skippen.

75,INTC,UPDATE 6-HP sinks as investors flee business revamp," * HP is doing too much at once -analysts   * Uncertainty likely to hurt PC sales -analysts   * Transformation may be expensive, drawn out   * Analysts downgrade stock, cut price targets   * Shares close off 20 percent, worst day since 1987  (Adds analyst comment, share price update)   By Sinead Carew and Sayantani Ghosh   NEW YORK/BANGALORE, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Inc (HPQ.N) shareholders delivered a sharp rebuke to CEO Leo Apotheker, wiping out $16 billion from the company’s market value on concerns that his plan to revive the No. 1 PC maker could do more harm than good in the near term.   The company’s shares fell 20 percent on Friday after a rash of announcements including a costly $11.7 billion acquisition, the killing of its tablet computer and a drawn-out review of its PC business that could lead to a spin-off. [ID:nN1E77H1JI]   On top of this, the company cut its full-year profit and revenue targets, resulting in the biggest drop of HP shares in a single day since Black Monday in 1987.   While Apotheker’s decisions appeared to make sense for the long term, the worry is that they will take too long to realize and cost to much, analysts said.   “It’s a lot to get your arms around,” Robert W. Baird analyst Jayson Noland said.   One big worry is that uncertainty surrounding the PC business will cause HP’s corporate customers to switch to rivals like Dell Inc DELL.O.   HP has been struggling in the PC market as niftier gadgets like iPad have lured away consumers. But it should not have told the world it would take 18 months to determine the fate of its PC business, which brings in 16 percent of its profits, said Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu.   “Why would anybody want to do business with them if it’s up for sale?” said Wu. “To have this in limbo for 12 months is going to be pretty material.”   Investors also worried that HP’s offer of nearly $12 billion for British software company Autonomy Corp AUTN.L was too high, even if software is a high-profit business.   “If you told me (the price) was half that it would seem more in line,” said Noland, adding that the timing was bad. “Their numbers are deteriorating and they’re trying to transform in the middle of a really bad economy.”   Analysts also questioned why HP was giving up so soon on the mobile business it bought for $1.2 billion from Palm Inc PALM.O — even as they doubted HP would ever defeat Apple Inc (AAPL.O), whose iPad and iPhone crushed Palm’s sales.   “There’s not a lot of confidence in (Apotheker’s) management,” said Wu. “This is just further proof.”   HP shares closed at $23.60 on Friday, making it the biggest loser in the S&P 500 Index .SPX, which fell 1.5 percent. Before the announcements, HP's shares had closed at $31.39 on Wednesday. Dell shares closed up nearly 2 percent on Friday.   “Last night HP may have eroded what remained of Wall Street’s confidence in the company and its strategy,” Needham & Co said in a research note.   Thursday’s weak financial forecast from HP follows smaller rival Dell’s lowered revenue outlook earlier this week that dragged down both stocks. [ID:nL3E7JH1ZW]   Both companies have been venturing out of traditional comfort zones and into enterprise solutions and services, but continuing soft sales have been a constant source of trouble.   At least two brokerages downgraded HP, and five cut their price targets, mainly citing uncertainty and expenses related to the restructuring.   Palo Alto, California-based HP said it has already stopped production devices like its TouchPad tablet, which were were based on the WebOS software it acquired from Palm. While the WebOS system has attracted a lot of media attention and admiration from technology analysts , it ultimately failed to attract buyers.   “It seems like a knee jerk reaction but I want to think its the right decision,” Noland said. “It was a lot of cost and a fairly large distraction over the last 9 months.”   Some analysts suggested that another company might buy the WebOS business or Palm patents but even if this Noland said he did not expect HP to make its investment back.   <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   TAKE A LOOK on HP:                         [ID:nL5E7JJ08D]   Graphic on Q2 tech results:    r.reuters.com/nuw62s  Breakingviews                              [ID:nN1E77I0O8]   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>    Gleacher & Co analyst Brian Marshall cut his price target for HP to $39 from $50 saying he “materially underestimated the magnitude and timing of this metamorphosis.”    He said, however, that HP “is undergoing a sound strategy transformation by focusing on high-growth, high-margin opportunities in the enterprise/commercial markets.”   With a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 5.6, the company is trailing its peers, including Dell, Apple (AAPL.O) and IBM (IBM.N), according to Starmine SmartEstimate.

76,INTC,HP sinks as investors flee business revamp,"NEW YORK/BANGALORE (Reuters) - Shares of Hewlett-Packard slumped by more than 20 percent to a six-year low on Friday as investors wiped about $16 billion off the market value of the world’s biggest PC maker in a resounding rejection of its plan for a major shake-up.  Investors also appeared to lose confidence in Chief Executive Leo Apotheker after a flurry of HP announcements on Thursday including an $11.7 billion acquisition offer, a shuttering of its mobile efforts and the potential spin-off its PC business.

On Thursday, HP said it may spin off its PC business — the world’s largest — as part of a wrenching series of moves away from the consumer market, including killing its new tablet and buying British software company Autonomy Corp for as much as $11.7 billion.  Intel’s PC Client group — which caters to personal computers — accounted for 64 percent of the chipmaker’s sales last quarter, the brokerage said. It maintained its “reduce” rating on the stock and a price target of $18.  Nomura said HP’s lowered outlook for the second half of 2011, consistent with Dell Inc and NetApp Inc’s weak forecasts, backs its view that Intel will miss its third-quarter outlook.  Last month, Intel forecast third-quarter revenue of about $14 billion, give or take $500 million.  Intel’s shares closed at $19.77 on Thursday on Nasdaq.

81,INTC,"UPDATE 3-AMD ends CEO search, hires Lenovo executive"," * New AMD CEO Rory Read was Lenovo president, COO   * He promises to be aggressive in adding mobile products   * AMD shares rise 0.5 pct  (Adds comments from analyst, new CEO. Updates share activity)   By Jim Finkle and Sinead Carew   BOSTON/NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.N on Thursday named a top executive with PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd (0992.HK) as its new CEO, ending a search that the chipmaker began in January.   The world’s No. 2 maker of computer microprocessors hired Rory Read, 49, from Lenovo, where he served as president and chief operating officer of the PC maker during a recent period of brisk growth.   He is under pressure to make AMD a player in developing chips for mobile devices, one of the few well performing areas for the hardware business. AMD wants to catch up with rivals including Intel Corp (INTC.O) and ARM Holdings ARM.L.   In a conference call with analysts, Read declined to provide specifics of his mobile strategy, but said he would act “just like a boxer.”   He praised the company’s workers, but said that there was still room for them to develop more of a “sense of urgency” about their work. “I think it’s always great to go faster. Faster is always better. Bigger is better. Those are always good things,” he said.   The chipmaker’s shares rose 0.5 percent on a day when the Nasdaq fell by nearly 2 percent on relief that the position was finally filled.   “There’s obviously some questions that need to be answered about how he envisions the smartphone market,” said Williams Financial Group analyst Cody Acree.   The chipmaker’s board ousted Read’s predecessor, Dirk Meyer, over disappointment with AMD’s limited success in developing products for the smartphone and mobile markets. Instead, the company focused on chips used in low-end netbook computers — a market that has been hurt by tablets such as Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) iPad.   AMD positioned Read as a turnaround expert and technology veteran who could lead the company into newer, faster-growing areas of the semiconductor market.   In the six months before AMD’s hiring of Read, the company’s shares fell 30 percent. Intel fell 7 percent during the same period.   The company credited Read for double-digit revenue growth and reversing operating losses at Lenovo, where he was promoted to president and COO in 2009. And it said that one of his achievements during a 23-year career at IBM (IBM.N) was turning around IBM’s Business Consulting Services division.   AMD’s shares rose 3 cents, or 0.47 percent, to $6.37 on New York Stock Exchange.  (Editing by Gerald E.

AMD’s shares rose 3 percent after it announced the appointment of Read — a technology industry veteran who previously served as Lenovo’s president and chief operating officer.   Read, 49, will be charged with narrowing the gap between AMD and top PC chipmaking rival Intel Corp (INTC.O). He will take over from Tom Seifert, who has served as the temporary leader since AMD’s board ousted Dirk Meyer more than half a year ago, after they disagreed over the chipmaker’s strategy to establish a footprint in a booming market for mobile devices.   AMD credited its new executive Read with driving double-digit revenue growth and reversing operating losses at Lenovo, where he was promoted to president and COO in 2009.   The chipmaker, which is a distant second to Intel in computer chips, abruptly removed Meyer in January because of concerns he had not targeted the market for chips used in tablet computers and smartphones.

84,INTC,Newsmaker: Cook's vision center stage after Jobs's departure,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tim Cook, the small-town football fanatic turned chief executive of the world’s largest technology company, long faced the question of whether he had the same remarkable vision as his predecessor Steve Jobs.  The question became even more important on Wednesday when Jobs resigned from Apple Inc and Cook took his place, with Jobs’ recommendation.  Apple’s long-time chief operating officer, Cook was confirmed as CEO by the company’s board, and Jobs was named chairman. Jobs has been on medical leave.  Cook now must prove that his technology instincts are as sharp as when he joined Apple in 1998 after leaving the once-mighty Compaq, then the world’s top PC maker. At the time Apple was barely afloat.  His gut decision during his first meeting with Jobs not only changed his life but altered the course of technology history.  “My most significant discovery so far in my life was the result of one single decision, my decision to join Apple,” Cook told Auburn University students at his alma mater last year.  “Working at Apple was never in any plan that I outlined for myself, but was without a doubt the best decision that I ever made.”  Now, as leader of one of the most highly recognizable brands, Cook will be called upon to satisfy investors and consumers who know Apple as a technology pioneer.  People who have known and worked with Cook over the past two decades use terms like “brilliant” and “phenomenal” to describe him.  He is also called a supply chain genius at a company that values operational efficiency nearly as much as design. Still, after years of relative anonymity as Jobs’s No. 2, Cook is in some ways untested.  “Tim has been de facto CEO for some time and the company has been hugely successful,” said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Financial. “The vision and the road map are intact.”  Cook started taking on more responsibility after Jobs was diagnosed with a rare form of pancreatic cancer and had a liver transplant. Jobs is on his third medical leave.  Despite his ill health and ongoing speculation about if and when Jobs would leave Apple, he turned up time and again at milestone company events to the delight and surprise of Wall Street and Main Street.  One of the things Cook shares with Jobs is sheer competitiveness.  “He’s not in it for the fame or the ego or the money. He’s in it to win,” said Greg Petsch, who was Cook’s boss at Compaq Computer in the late 1990s.  For a graphic on Tim Cook's impact on margins, click on: r.reuters.com/vuq28r How Cook got his job is part of Apple legend. As recounted in the Wall Street Journal, Jobs, then newly returned to Apple to reinvigorate the company, had turned down several applicants in characteristically brusque fashion, including walking out midway through one interview.  By Cook’s own account, they took to each other instantly, and Cook made his fateful decision. He was told he would be a fool to leave Compaq for an also-ran on the verge of bankruptcy. But his mind was made up.  “I listened to my intuition, not the left side of my brain,” Cook said.  Jobs and Cook have balanced each other ever since. Where Jobs is famous for his explosive temper, firing employees on the spot, Cook is described as down-to-earth and soft-spoken.  Where Jobs is known for his New Age interest in vegetarianism and spirituality, Cook, who is from Alabama, loves Auburn U football and is a fitness fanatic.  And where Jobs enjoyed rockstar-like fame early in his career as a pioneer of the computer era, the intensely private Cook toiled for years in obscurity, an operations wonk who became chief lieutenant at one of the world’s coolest companies.  A person who worked with Cook at Apple said, “He has a steel trap of a mind.”  “He not only knows everything about what he’s doing, he knows everything about what you’re doing, too.”  Some say Cook’s achievements, not to mention his skillful management of Apple’s resurgent Mac unit, show he is much more than a by-the-numbers supply chain expert.  “They call him an operational genius, but Tim’s a lot more strategic than he’s been getting credit for,” said Petsch.  Although operations executives are not generally considered CEO material, Petsch pointed to former Intel CEO Craig Barrett’s rise to the top from COO jobs.  “He is very highly regarded internally at Apple,” said Ashok Kumar, an analyst at Rodman & Renshaw. “From a succession perspective, they could not possibly identify a better candidate. He has a track record to back it up.”  Others argue that it is outdated to think of Apple as simply a vehicle for Jobs’s savant-like technology vision.  Jobs has for years been surrounded by a superbly talented management team, executives like design chief Jonathan Ive, mobile software guru Scott Forstall and product marketing head Phil Schiller, who will be there for Cook.  There is little doubt that much of the Apple mystique revolves around Jobs. His far-sighted, sometimes counterintuitive approach has guided Apple to a string of triumphs.  Although Jobs was involved in strategic decisions Cook has been running the company day-to-day.  Cook has acknowledged that Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, California, is a long way from Robertsdale, Alabama, calling his journey “improbable.”  “I am where I am in life because my parents sacrificed more than they should have, because of teachers, professors, friends and mentors who cared more than they had to, and because of Steve Jobs and Apple,” Cook said last year at Auburn.  Cook was the middle of three boys in a family described by people in Robertsdale as “real nice.” His parents, Geraldine and Donald, have become local celebrities of a sort, as their son’s star has risen.  At Robertsdale High School, Cook finished No. 2 in his class of roughly 175 students in 1978, was president of the National Honor Society, played in the band, and was voted “most studious,” according to the yearbook.  He earned a degree in industrial engineering from Auburn in 1982, and received his MBA from Duke University in 1988.  Cook’s technology career traces the arc of the early days of the computer revolution.  He spent 12 years at IBM working in distribution and manufacturing in North America before moving in 1994 to computer reseller Intelligent Electronics, where he developed a reputation as an operations maven.  “The guy is just a phenomenal operating executive,” said Mark Briggs, who was Cook’s boss at IE. Briggs remembers a highly analytical executive, focused on metrics, who overhauled the company’s supply chain.  “He just works all the time, that’s his life.”  Compaq had hired Cook in 1997 to be vice president of worldwide materials, but he spent only six months at the Houston-based company before defecting to Apple.  His impact on Apple was swift. The company, which had reported a $1 billion loss in fiscal 1997, swung to a profit in fiscal 1998.  Apple simplified its product lines, cut the number of distributors and resellers, and outsourced some manufacturing, among other changes. This had the effect of reducing bloated inventory to a fifth of levels in the previous year.  Gross margin, which stood at 19 percent in 1997, surged to 25 percent in 1998 and climbed to 39.4 percent by fiscal 2010.  Cook took over as head of global sales in 2000, and was appointed to lead Apple’s Mac division in 2004. He was promoted to the COO spot in 2005.  He was Jobs’s go-to guy.

86,INTC,Oracle brings new claims against HP in Itanium case,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Oracle Corp accused Hewlett-Packard Co of fraud for concealing facts during negotiations between the two companies, according to a court filing.  The cross complaint filed by Oracle against HP on Tuesday is the latest salvo in ongoing litigation over the Itanium platform.  Oracle decided in March to discontinue its support for Itanium, a heavy-duty computing microprocessor, saying Intel Corp made it clear the chip was nearing the end of its life and the company’s focus was on its x86 microprocessor.  HP has dubbed Oracle’s decision “anti-customer” behavior. The company sued Oracle in a California state court in June.  The litigation has been part of a deteriorating relationship between the two companies. Oracle hired former HP chief executive Mark Hurd last year after Hurd left HP amid questions about his relationship with a female contractor.  HP filed a trade secrets lawsuit against Hurd related to the Oracle hire, which was soon settled.  In the filing on Tuesday, Oracle claims HP fraudulently induced Oracle to enter into the Hurd settlement.  HP concealed the fact it was about to hire Leo Apotheker as its chief executive and Ray Lane as its chairman, Oracle’s filing says.  Apotheker and Oracle CEO Larry Ellison have long been rivals from the time Apotheker headed European software maker SAP AG. HP Chairman Ray Lane and Ellison had a troubled relationship from the time Lane was fired from Oracle in 2000, according to the filing.  “Given the well-documented animosity between Oracle and Messrs. Apotheker and Lane, HP knew that Oracle would not have signed the Hurd Agreement had it known of HP’s imminent plans,” the filing says.  HP spokeswoman Mylene Mangalindan said HP is resolved to enforcing Oracle’s commitments to HP and to their shared customers.  “Rather than focusing on what is right for our joint customers, Oracle is relying on invented excuses to cover up its blatant disregard for its legal obligations,” Mangalindan said in an email.  Other claims asserted by Oracle against HP include defamation and intentional interference with contractual relations. Oracle seeks rescission of the Hurd agreement, general and punitive damages and other remedies.  The case in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara is Hewlett-Packard Company v. Oracle Corporation, No. 11CV203163.

Oracle decided in March to discontinue its support for Itanium, a heavy-duty computing microprocessor, saying Intel Corp (INTC.O) made it clear the chip was nearing the end of its life and the company’s focus was on its x86 microprocessor.   HP has dubbed Oracle’s decision “anti-customer” behavior. The company sued Oracle in a California state court in June.   The litigation has been part of a deteriorating relationship between the two companies. Oracle hired former HP chief executive Mark Hurd last year after Hurd left HP amid questions about his relationship with a female contractor.   HP filed a trade secrets lawsuit against Hurd related to the Oracle hire, which was soon settled.   In the filing on Tuesday, Oracle claims HP fraudulently induced Oracle to enter into the Hurd settlement.   HP concealed the fact it was about to hire Leo Apotheker as its chief executive and Ray Lane as its chairman, Oracle’s filing says.   Apotheker and Oracle CEO Larry Ellison have long been rivals from the time Apotheker headed European software maker SAP AG (SAPG.DE). HP Chairman Ray Lane and Ellison had a troubled relationship from the time Lane was fired from Oracle in 2000, according to the filing.   “Given the well-documented animosity between Oracle and Messrs. Apotheker and Lane, HP knew that Oracle would not have signed the Hurd Agreement had it known of HP’s imminent plans,” the filing says.   HP spokeswoman Mylene Mangalindan said HP is resolved to enforcing Oracle’s commitments to HP and to their shared customers.   “Rather than focusing on what is right for our joint customers, Oracle is relying on invented excuses to cover up its blatant disregard for its legal obligations,” Mangalindan said in an email.   Other claims asserted by Oracle against HP include defamation and intentional interference with contractual relations. Oracle seeks rescission of the Hurd agreement, general and punitive damages and other remedies.   The case in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara is Hewlett-Packard Company v. Oracle Corporation, No. 11CV203163.

88,INTC,"HP may resurrect TouchPad, weighs PC spinoff","BEIJING (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co may resurrect its TouchPad as it weighs a spinoff of its personal computer arm, the head of its PC division said, suggesting HP might revive a tablet that lasted just six weeks in the face of stiff competition from Apple Inc.  HP stunned markets two weeks ago, when it announced it may shed its PC business — the world’s largest after the $25 billion acquisition of Compaq in 2002 — as part of a wrenching series of moves away from the consumer market. Those included killing off the TouchPad tablet computer.  Now, the board of the largest U.S. technology company by revenue is expected to decide before the end of the year whether to hive off its PC arm — which began selling the TouchPad in July — into a separate company, considered the best option for shareholders.  Personal Systems Group head Todd Bradley told Reuters in an interview he intends to lead any standalone company created, and expects it to be a full-fledged computer maker spanning tablets, ultra-thin and all-in-one PCs.  “Tablet computing is a segment of the market that’s relevant, absolutely,” he said, without elaborating. He said a spinoff of the Personal Systems Group will bring the “best value” to HP shareholders for taxation and other reasons.  “My intention would be to lead it through this transaction ... and if it’s a standalone public company, to lead that.”  Selling the PC division to a rival such as Taiwan’s Acer Inc, which acquired computer maker Gateway in 2007, or to China’s Lenovo Group Ltd, which bought IBM’s PC division in 2004, is not a desirable alternative, Bradley said.  “I would just say that the numbers don’t support that that strategy works,” he said, citing Acer reporting its first-ever quarterly loss last week.  HP has struggled in the PC market — a high-revenue but low-margin business — as popular devices such as Apple’s iPad lure consumers away.  Bradley is on a trip to China, Taiwan and South Korea to meet with employees, suppliers, government officials and media to convince them that HP’s PC business will remain robust and committed to Asian markets.  “China’s obviously a critically important market for HP as well as PSG,” he said.  Bradley said HP will increase investments in Shanghai, and over the next three years expand its Shanghai manufacturing base, consolidate six employee sites into one campus, and make Shanghai a regional headquarters in China for the PSG.  “Regardless of what happens, we’re the largest PC company in the world. We need everybody energized, and while this isn’t business as usual, we need people to go out and sell products every day,” Bradley said.  Suppliers to HP PCs will remain largely intact, although the company may renegotiate and redefine the relationships.  “Unwinding the integration that’s taken place within HP will be enormous amounts of work and effort, justified by the return we think we’ll be able to provide to our shareholders.”  Nevertheless, he said, “we will be one of, if not the largest, customers of all of our major suppliers, be it Samsung to LG to Microsoft to Intel.”  The Palo Alto, California-based company is now exploring options for its WebOS software, which it acquired through the acquisition of Palm, of which Bradley is a former chief executive.  Bradley has said that a number of companies had expressed interest in possibly using WebOS as an operating system, but he gave no further details on Tuesday, saying that he is not in China to announce or even negotiate anything regarding WebOS.

90,INTC,UPDATE 4-US solar company that Obama visited will shut down," * Solyndra received $535 mln loan guarantee, Obama visit   * Company cutting 1,100 jobs immediately   * Bankruptcy filing likely early next week   * Company raised some $1 bln in venture capital funds  (Adds DOE, Republican lawmaker comments)   By Nichola Groom   LOS ANGELES, Aug 31 (Reuters) - U.S. solar start-up Solyndra LLC, succumbing to pressure from lower-cost Chinese rivals, said it has suspended operations and plans to file for bankruptcy, 15 months after President Barack Obama visited a company factory that was to be expanded with the help of a federal loan guarantee.   The Chapter 11 filing, expected next week, will make Solyndra the third U.S. solar company to seek bankruptcy protection in the last month. Former Wall Street high flyer Evergreen Solar Inc ESLRQ.PK filed for Chapter 11 two weeks ago, followed four days later by SpectraWatt Inc, a private company that was backed by Intel Corp (INTC.O).   U.S. Representative Henry Waxman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce said the bankruptcies “are unfortunate warnings that the United States is in danger of losing its leadership position in the clean energy economy of the future ... We should be doing everything possible to ensure the United States does not cede the renewable energy market to China and other countries.”   In a press release on Wednesday, Solyndra said it could not compete with bigger overseas rivals. Earlier this year, cuts to generous solar subsidies in No. 2 market Italy stalled development of solar projects and led to a global glut of solar panels that sparked a 25 percent drop in prices.   Even industry heavyweights such as China’s Suntech Power Holdings Co Ltd STP.N and U.S.-based First Solar Inc (FSLR.O) are struggling with dwindling profits, while small, up-and-coming solar companies are finding it increasingly difficult to stay afloat. [ID:nN1E77O11T]   Solyndra said it was evaluating options, including a sale of the business and licensing its copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) technology.   About 1,100 employees are being laid off immediately, it said in a statement.   A company spokesman said the bankruptcy filing would likely come early next week in Delaware.   Solyndra simply could not compete with “Chinese firms that have received billions of dollars in low-cost loans from state banks and have access to a well developed domestic supply chain for solar manufacturing,” GTM Research analyst Shyam Mehta said. The company’s relatively unproven CIGS technology was another key reason for its demise, he added.   “Solyndra has been swimming upstream ever since it entered the market,” Mehta said.   The announcement is the latest in a series of disappointments for Solyndra, whose fall from grace has been tracked closely because it received a $535 million loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy in 2009.   The company also made headlines in May 2010 when Obama paid a visit to the company’s Fremont, California, factory.   Solyndra was the first company to receive a loan guarantee under an advanced clean energy program created in 2005. The Energy Department came under criticism last year when the company postponed plans to expand the Fremont factory, cut jobs and withdrew plans for an initial public offering.   At the time, U.S. firms were just beginning to smart from the rapid influx of cheap solar panels from China.   “We have always recognized that not every one of the innovative companies supported by our loans and loan guarantees would succeed, but we can’t stop investing in game-changing technologies,” DOE Director of Public Affairs Dan Leistikow said in a blog post on Wednesday on the DOE Website.   Still, Republican lawmakers said Solyndra was a bad bet from the start.   “We smelled a rat from the onset,” Representatives Fred Upton of the Energy and Commerce Committee and Cliff Stearns of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee said in a joint statement. “In this time of record debt such disregard for taxpayer dollars cannot be tolerated.”   The Energy and Commerce committee has been probing Solyndra’s loan guarantee since early this year, and in July subpoenaed White House documents related to the loan. [ID:nN1E76C20A]   Solyndra received some $1 billion in venture capital funds from investors including CMEA Ventures, Argonaut Ventures, Madrone Partners, Redpoint Ventures, funds affiliated with RockPort Capital Partners, and U.S. Venture Partners.   Prior to Solyndra, Evergreen Solar was the most high-profile U.S. solar company to collapse. Evergreen was once at the forefront of U.S. renewable energy technology and had planned to produce its solar wafers in Massachusetts. Ultimately, even a plan to shift manufacturing to Asia could not save it.

LTX-Credence’s warning underscores the problems faced by the chip testing equipment industry and echoes the weak outlook from its larger rivals Japan-based Advantest Corp and Teradyne Inc . 	   Average worldwide bookings for chip equipment fell 16 percent — largest in over a year — in July, according to industry body Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International.	   “Customers ... are slowing their growth plans based on end demand and that translates back into slowing of orders,” said LTX CEO David Tacelli in a conference call.	   “There are no cancellations, no push outs but there is a change in forecast that got aggressively worse over the month or so.”	   Most chipmakers, including bellwether Intel Corp  and Texas Instruments , as well as contract chipmakers, such as TSMC , have warned of a difficult current quarter as weak demand pushes up inventories.	   “We think because they (LTX-Credence) have a smaller customer base than peers their revenue base is more volatile,” D. A. Davidson analyst Thomas Diffely said.	   “They derive most of their revenue from the consumer and automotive end markets and a bit of a slowdown, specifically in those markets, is hurting them.”	   Atmel , one of LTX’s top customers, had forecast third-quarter sales below market expectations earlier this month as growth in its industrial and automotive end-markets slowed.	   LTX-Credence expects a first-quarter adjusted loss of 6-10 cents per share and revenue to nearly halve to $35-$39 million.	   Analysts were expecting earnings of 26 cents per share on revenue of $64.2 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.	   Net income in the fourth quarter fell 12 percent to $12.1 million, or 24 cents per share. Excluding items, it earned 27 cents per share.	   Sales fell 14 percent to $62.7 million. Almost a third of the total revenue comes from Taiwan - home to its largest customer Spirox Corp , and TSMC, the world’s top contract chip maker.	   Analysts were expecting fourth-quarter earnings of 28 cents per share, on revenue of $65.7 million.	   Shares of the Milpitas, California-based company were down 18 percent at $5.40 in morning trading on Wednesday.

93,INTC,Zarlink expecting white-knight takeover offer,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Specialty chipmaker Zarlink Semiconductor said on Thursday it expects a white knight to best a hostile C$550 million ($561 million) takeover offer from U.S. rival Microsemi, and is in talks with at least 15 potential buyers.  Zarlink said third parties were interested in buying either part or all of the Ottawa-based company, which designs computer chips for communications and medical applications.  “Based on the level of interest which has been expressed to date ... it is likely that a transaction will emerge from the board’s strategic process which is superior to the Microsemi offers,” Zarlink Chairman Adam Chowaniec said in a statement.  Zarlink did not identify the suitors, but analysts say its award-winning medical applications technology - it builds wireless chips for medical devices such as pacemakers and defibrillators - could attract such industry giants as Intel, Texas Instruments and Qualcomm, which are either entering or active in the sector.  California-based Microsemi has offered C$3.35 a share for Zarlink, but the shares have consistently traded higher than that since Microsemi first made its proposal public in July, suggesting the market thinks a higher bid is likely.  Zarlink said several parties have started due diligence and expressed interest in pursuing a transaction.  “Fifteen is a big number, and I’ve always thought, from day one since this thing was announced, that there was a high probability of at least one rival bid. I continue to hold to that view,” said Brian Piccioni, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets.  Jeff Mo, a portfolio manager whose firm Mawer Investment Management holds a 2.4 percent stake in Zarlink, also expects a higher bid.  “In our sensitivity analysis we felt that Zarlink could be worth between C$3.50 and C$4.50 a share,” he said.  But Microsemi held to its cash offer price on Thursday, saying the Zarlink board had yet to reveal an alternative.  “There is nothing in Zarlink’s circular that would lead us to conclude there is additional value in the company that was not understood by us, or the market, prior to our bid,” the company said.  Zarlink stock closed up 2.79 percent at C$3.69 in Toronto on Thursday.  The shares have lagged their peers, but analysts say a turnaround in its financial performance in the past three to four years, and a significant build-up in its medical business, are promising growth, making Zarlink more attractive to strategic buyers.  “The Microsemi offers are highly opportunistic,” Chowaniec said. “They come at an inflection point in Zarlink’s financial, technological and operational repositioning.”  Microsemi went hostile with a formal offer to shareholders on August 17, following its public proposal in July and unofficial talks with Zarlink that started in January.  The U.S. company has been an aggressive buyer in recent years, acquiring nine companies since 2009. Its bid for Zarlink includes an offer to debenture holders of C$1,367.35 per C$1,000 principal amount of convertible debentures.  Zarlink said that all of its directors and officers intend to reject the bid, and urged shareholders to do so as well.  Telecom and cable companies use Zarlink’s main communications products, including line circuits and network timing and synchronization products, to deliver bundled voice, video, data and mobile services.

Microsemi, which has bought nine other companies since 2009, has offered C$3.35 a share for Ottawa-based Zarlink, and the bid expires September 22. Zarlink, a Canadian specialty chipmaker, says it has held talks with 15 potential suitors and that they will likely yield a higher offer.  “If they have a party that’s fully funded, they should really name the baby ... who is it?” Microsemi Chief Executive Jim Peterson told Reuters in an interview on Friday.  “At this point, come 22 September, in these market conditions I might take my fully funded money and go to what I call Plan B or Plan C and quite frankly, we’ll find out where it trades on the 23rd.”  Microsemi has been courting Zarlink since the beginning of the year, and at one point offered to pay as much as C$3.55 a share for the Ottawa-based designer of computer chips for communications and medical applications.  It made its interest in Zarlink public with a takeover proposal in July, and followed that with an official hostile bid on August 17.  Zarlink shares have consistently traded above the Microsemi bid, suggesting the market thinks a higher bid is likely.  “At C$3.35, this is a good company, and I’m here to tell you that it is not worth where it’s trading at today,” Peterson said.  “Here’s my open offer. I’ll sign an NDA (non-disclosure agreement). I certainly wouldn’t sign a standstill. I’ll look under the hood, but the C$3.55 number that I put my name on, I have to back off of that right now.”  Analysts point at industry giants such as Intel (INTC.O), Texas Instruments TXN.N and Qualcomm (QCOM.O) as potential suitors for Zarlink’s award-winning medical applications technology, building wireless chips for medical devices such as pacemakers and defibrillators.  Zarlink shares were trading at C$3.65 a share on Friday afternoon, reversing earlier gains that took the stock as high as C$3.71.  Zarlink has not identified any of its potential suitors, saying only that parties are interested in the company as a whole or in its parts.  It said its directors and officers intend to reject the Microsemi offer and recommended shareholders to do the same.

101,INTC,"HP exec says PC unit spinoff ""best value""","BEIJING (Reuters) - A spin-off of Hewlett-Packard Co’s PC unit would be the best value for shareholders, according to the head of its PC division, who added that tablet computing was “relevant” to the future market for any spinoff.  HP stunned markets two weeks ago, when it announced it may shed its PC business — the world’s largest after the $25 billion acquisition of Compaq in 2002 — as part of a wrenching series of moves away from the consumer market. Those included killing off the TouchPad tablet computer in the face of stiff competition from Apple Inc..  Now, the board of the largest U.S. technology company by revenue is expected to decide before the end of the year whether to hive off its PC arm — which began selling the TouchPad in July — into a separate company, considered the best option for shareholders.  Personal Systems Group head Todd Bradley told Reuters in an interview he intends to lead any standalone company created, and expects it to be a full-fledged computer maker.  Asked if there could be a tablet in the future of the separated company, Bradley responded:  “Sure, of course. Tablet computing is a segment of the market that’s relevant, absolutely.”  He said a spinoff of the Personal Systems Group will bring the “best value” to HP shareholders for taxation and other reasons.  “My intention would be to lead it through this transaction ... and if it’s a standalone public company, to lead that.”  Selling the PC division to a rival such as Taiwan’s Acer Inc, which acquired computer maker Gateway in 2007, or to China’s Lenovo Group Ltd, which bought IBM’s PC division in 2004, is not a desirable alternative, Bradley said.  “I would just say that the numbers don’t support that that strategy works,” he said, citing Acer reporting its first-ever quarterly loss last week.  HP has struggled in the PC market — a high-revenue but low-margin business — as popular devices such as Apple’s iPad lure consumers away.  Bradley is on a trip to China, Taiwan and South Korea to meet with employees, suppliers, government officials and media to convince them that HP’s PC business will remain robust and committed to Asian markets.  “China’s obviously a critically important market for HP as well as PSG,” he said.  Bradley said HP will increase investments in Shanghai, and over the next three years expand its Shanghai manufacturing base, consolidate six employee sites into one campus, and make Shanghai a regional headquarters in China for the PSG.  “Regardless of what happens, we’re the largest PC company in the world. We need everybody energized, and while this isn’t business as usual, we need people to go out and sell products every day,” Bradley said.  Suppliers to HP PCs will remain largely intact, although the company may renegotiate and redefine the relationships.  “Unwinding the integration that’s taken place within HP will be enormous amounts of work and effort, justified by the return we think we’ll be able to provide to our shareholders.”  Nevertheless, he said, “we will be one of, if not the largest, customers of all of our major suppliers, be it Samsung to LG to Microsoft to Intel.”  The Palo Alto, California-based company is now exploring options for its WebOS software, which it acquired through the acquisition of Palm, of which Bradley is a former chief executive.  Bradley has said that a number of companies had expressed interest in possibly using WebOS as an operating system, but he gave no further details on Tuesday, saying that he is not in China to announce or even negotiate anything regarding WebOS.

104,INTC,U.S. solar firm Solyndra files for bankruptcy,"WILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) - Solyndra LLC, a solar panel maker that received $535 million in federal loan guarantees, filed for bankruptcy, the third U.S. solar firm to succumb to pressure from Chinese rivals in recent weeks.  Solyndra, which also received more than $700 million in venture capital funding, said it will try to find a buyer quickly to avoid a firesale liquidation.  The solar industry has been in turmoil this year as a glut of panels has sent prices plummeting 25 percent. Manufacturing capacity expanded just as government austerity measures in Europe eliminated subsidies and undercut demand.  Solyndra cut prices to try to compete but said in court papers that it was unable to match the extended payment terms offered by foreign competitors.  Last week the Fremont, California-based company said it had suspended operations and laid off 1,100 workers.  Solyndra’s bankruptcy filing on Tuesday follows similar filings by former Wall Street high flyer Evergreen Solar Inc and SpectraWatt Inc, a private company that was backed by Intel Corp.  Even industry heavyweights such as China’s Suntech Power Holdings Co Ltd and U.S.-based First Solar Inc are struggling with dwindling profits, while small, up-and-coming solar companies are finding it increasingly difficult to stay afloat.  Solyndra said in documents filed in Delaware’s bankruptcy court that it plans to spend the next four weeks trying to drum up interest among potential U.S. and foreign buyers to avoid shutting down permanently and selling its assets piecemeal to repay its creditors.  If it finds a buyer, could lead the rehiring of some of its laid off workers. One of those workers filed a class action lawsuit against the company in the bankruptcy court for violating the federal WARN Act, which requires larger companies to give 60 days advance notice of layoffs.  The company did not return a call for comment.  The company was founded in 2005 to commercialize its light-weight panels, which are made up of cylinders rather than conventional flat panels. Solyndra was touted by MIT Technology Review as one of the 50 most innovative companies in the world and was visited last year by President Barack Obama.  Solyndra raised more than $700 million by selling preferred shares to venture capitalists, including Argonaut Ventures LLC of San Francisco, which owns about 39 percent of the company. Argonaut is also among the company’s first-lien lenders, meaning it will be the first to be repaid, ahead of the U.S. government.  The company has secured debts of $783.8 million, according to court documents.  Other venture backers include Madrone Partners, USVP Venture Partners and Rockport Capital Partners, according to court documents.  Argonaut and Madrone plan to provide Solyndra with $4 million in debtor-in-possession financing, at 15 percent interest, to get the company through its four-week search for a buyer, according to court documents.  The company must pay off the $4 million bankruptcy loan as well as the $69.3 million owed to the first-lien lenders before it begins to repay the government-guaranteed loan from the U.S. Federal Financing Bank, a unit of the U.S. Treasury.  The case is Solyndra LLC, Case No. 11-12799, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware.

106,INTC,"Nvidia up on outlook, analysts skeptical","(Reuters) - Shares of Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) jumped more than 11 percent on Wednesday, as investors bet on strong sales for the company’s chips used in mobile devices like smartphones and tablets.  The chipmaker forecast strong 2013 sales, but analysts said the outlook was too optimistic given the current macro environment and increased competition as rivals Intel (INTC.O) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.N step on the gas.  “We find it difficult to believe that, in the current economic environment, a company that is 80 percent exposed to consumer spending has meaningful visibility into demand over the next 18 months,” analyst Daniel Berenhaum at MKM Partners said.  Nvidia said it expects its Tegra product, which is used in mobile devices like smartphones and accounts for about 10 percent to total revenue, to contribute roughly $1 billion to sales in fiscal 2013 — much higher than analysts’ expectations.  In an interview with Forbes on Tuesday, CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said he expects Android tablets running Nvidia’s new quad-core processor to be available this year, ahead of competitor Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O).  Nvidia, which also competes with Samsung Electronics Co (005930.KS) and Texas Instruments TXN.N, said it has 70 percent of the Android tablet market share. This accounts for about 30 percent of the overall tablet market, which is dominated by Apple Inc (AAPL.O).  A dreary economy had weakened sentiments for chipmakers on supply chain concerns caused by Japan’s earthquake in March and lower PC sales.

Shares of the Santa Clara, California-based company rose to $14.64 in heavy trading on Wednesday.

108,INTC,Chip stocks may have hit bottom - Barron's," NEW YORK, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Chips stocks may have hit bottom and could be poised for a rebound ahead of January’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, according to a report in the Sept. 12 issue of Barron’s.  The shares of companies that make chips for everything from smartphones to computers have fallen sharply. They dropped again last week but declined less than the broader market.  Meanwhile, Fairchild Semiconductor FCS.N, Altera (ALTR.O) and Texas Instruments TXN.N have said they will log lower sales than originally expected in the quarter ending this month.  “The stocks are valued as if they’ll never see growth again, which is probably not true,” Barron’s wrote, adding that the broad nature of the revisions suggests a problem with the wider economy and not something specific to the industry.  Other chip stocks are also valued more cheaply now than they have been historically. Nvidia (NVDA.O) is trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 13.9. In February, the stock had a forward multiple of 25.  Intel (INTC.O), the world’s largest chipmaker, is trading at 8.3 times its projected earnings. That is not far from the multiple at which Fairchild — a much smaller company — trades, and does not include the $2 per share of cash-after-debt that Intel has.

109,INTC,Bets on euro zone progress boost Wall Street,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks gained on Tuesday as investors bought shares beaten down in recent weeks and bet European leaders would take action soon to ease the Greek debt crisis.  Worries the euro zone crisis could tip the global economy into another recession have pummeled stocks, though the selling has reached a level that some argue a Greek default is priced in to the market.  Investors appeared to be pinning hopes on progress being made during a conference call planned between French President Nicolas Sarkozy, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou on Wednesday.  Buyers pushed large-cap tech shares higher. They are viewed by some as less risky stock bets and an area likely to benefit in an improving economic climate.  Some analysts said the market had factored in more negative scenarios so that any improvement in Europe would be a reason to buy.  “There’s still a chance there’s some big rescue package coming, but I think that investors have mulled over the worst-case, short-term scenarios,” said Bryant Evans, investment adviser and portfolio manager at Cozad Asset Management, in Champaign, Illinois.  “I think investors are perhaps becoming a little more comfortable with the idea that Greece is probably going to have to default.”  Reuters calculations based on Markit credit default swap prices put the probability of a Greek default at 90 percent. Greek two-year bond yields hit a record near 94 percent.  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was up 44.73 points, or 0.40 percent, at 11,105.85. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX was up 10.60 points, or 0.91 percent, at 1,172.87. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was up 37.06 points, or 1.49 percent, at 2,532.15.  Overseas stocks also rose, with the FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top European shares ending up 1.1 percent.  Oracle Corp ORCL.O, Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) provided the biggest boosts to the Nasdaq index, with Oracle up 3.6 percent at $27.72.  The industrial sector led gainers on the S&P 500. The S&P industrial index .GSPI was up 1.9 percent.  Among declining stocks, Best Buy (BBY.N) said quarterly sales were flat, missing estimates on weak demand for televisions, but the big consumer electronics chain stood by its fiscal-year revenue outlook. Its shares slid 6.5 percent to $23.35.  Volume was 7.8 billion shares on the NYSE, Amex and Nasdaq, slightly above last year’s average of 7.6 billion.

111,INTC,Developers get early taste of Windows 8,"ANAHEIM, California (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp handed out 5,000 sleek Samsung tablet computers running a test version of Windows 8 at its annual developer conference on Tuesday, hoping to stoke excitement over its new operating system.  The devices, powered by Intel Corp i5 chips, are the first chance for people outside Microsoft to play with Windows 8, the temporary code name for its next software system that includes features tailored for touchscreens and tablets. The company is betting the new system will stem the tide of consumers switching to Apple Inc’s iPad.  Microsoft, whose software still runs more than 90 percent of personal computers, needs the new system to appeal to developers in the hope that they will create thousands of applications to attract users.  At the same time, it needs to lure a younger, tech-savvy audience and halt the march of Apple devices into Microsoft’s business market, analysts said.  “Kids today are seeing more Apple logos than Microsoft logos, and Microsoft needs to change that if they are going to continue being the force that they have been,” said Michael Silver, an analyst at tech research firm Gartner, who was attending the developer conference.  “If you look at where Apple is successful, it’s from consumers who have more power to bring in what they use at home to the business,” Silver said. “That’s important for Microsoft to go after, to get this fixed.”  Tablet makers are expected to start selling products with Windows 8 by the middle of next year at the earliest.  The giant U.S. software company also hopes to woo an applications development community that has already taken to Google’s Android and Apple, by making the process of building apps in a variety of computer languages simpler.  Developers worldwide can download a preview of Windows 8 from Microsoft beginning Tuesday evening (at dev.windows.com ).  The new system boots up in seconds and features a home page filled with colorful tiles taking the user directly into applications such as Facebook, messaging or news feeds.  Rebuilt from the ground up, Windows 8 uses less memory to run than Windows 7, freeing up space for apps. The test Samsung device, using Internet Explorer 10 as its browser, worked smoothly, although some of the demonstrations on stage at the conference did not work perfectly.  “Clearly this is pre-beta, but all things considered, I was impressed with the speed and responsiveness of the user interface and also the IE 10 browser,” said Al Hilwa, an analyst at tech research firm IDC, who tried out the Samsung tablet.  Windows 8 is less likely to appeal to business users, analysts said, given that many companies are still working their way toward switching to Windows 7, released in 2009.  Microsoft has sold almost 450 million Windows 7 licenses in two years since it was introduced, but the newest version still accounts for less than one-third of global Windows users, many of whom are clinging to older versions.  The new system is the first to be compatible with low-power chips designed by ARM Holdings, which have become the standard for mobile devices.  Windows unit chief Steven Sinofsky stressed the new operating system is the first to focus on applications — it will contain an online app store for the first time — reflecting the way people now use computers, tablets and smartphones.  He said tablets running Windows 8 will be able to connect easily to printers, cameras and other devices. Windows 8 will also work on PCs with regular mouse and keyboard commands. Thin new laptops by Acer, Asustek and Toshiba featured in presentations at the conference.  Sinofsky — who called the free tablet distributed at the conference “not an iPad” — emphasized it was a development machine only, and will not appear in stores. It features about 30 different apps written over the summer by Microsoft interns.  Analysts said Microsoft wants to get Windows 8 devices in stores for the “back-to-school” season next year, starting around July, or the holiday shopping season at the latest.  Microsoft itself has not set a schedule publicly for release of Windows 8, with Sinofsky saying on Tuesday the process would be “driven by quality, not by a date.”  Microsoft shares closed up 0.6 percent at $26.04 in a generally higher market.

113,INTC,"Intel, Google unveil Android mobile partnership","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp and Google Inc launched a development partnership on Tuesday, the latest effort by the world’s dominant maker of PC microprocessors to break into the booming smartphone market.  The two companies will work together to optimize future versions of Google’s Android mobile software for Intel’s “Atom” processors, hoping to speed the development and time-to-market of future Intel-powered smartphones.  The move could jump-start Intel’s efforts to expand into the market for mobile phones and touchscreen tablet devices at a time when sales of PCs are slowing.  The first Android phones featuring Google chips should be available in the first half of 2012, Intel executives said at the company’s annual developer conference in San Francisco on Tuesday.  Intel is allying itself with one of the biggest players in the mobile industry. In August, Google announced plans to acquire mobile phone maker Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion.  And Android software, which Google licenses free to manufacturers, is currently the most popular smartphone software, ahead of Apple’s iOS as well as software by Microsoft and Research in Motion.  While Intel is the world’s No. 1 maker of PC microprocessors, it has struggled to gain a foothold in the new class of mobile gadgets such as smartphones and tablets.  Today’s crop of smartphones, from the iPhone to devices based on Android software, use chips from companies like Texas Instruments and Samsung which in turn license technology from ARM Holdings.  Those chips are considered more power efficient than Intel’s — a key factor for handheld, battery-powered devices.  But Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini, speaking at the conference, said the smartphone market is still in its early stages.  “The smartphone business is not established in terms of the ultimate shake-out of who’s going to win and who is going to lose,” Otellini said during a chat with reporters following his keynote speech.  “You saw what happened in terms of how fast Android took share from Apple,” he said. “So good products on good platforms can really still make a big difference in this industry.”  While Android technically already could support Intel chips, the new partnership will make it much easier for a manufacturer to bring an Intel-based Android phone to market.  Until now, it has been up to phone manufacturers to make their Android phones compatible with Intel chips, whereas future versions of the Android software will work with Intel chips right out of the gate, and will be optimized to take advantage of Intel’s technology.  “It’s really about Google saying that Intel is going to be a first-class citizen in the Android ecosystem,” said David Kanter, an analyst with Real World Technologies.  But he added that Intel still needs to win over hardware makers if it hopes to succeed in the smartphone  market.  Otellini also again highlighted his confidence in the new “ultrabook” computing market during Tuesday’s speech, saying the lighter, sleeker laptops should hit store shelves starting this holiday season.

120,INTC,"Obama signs patent bill, sees boost for innovators","(Reuters) - President Barack Obama signed into law a patent overhaul bill on Friday that backers say will curb frivolous lawsuits and help the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office do the hiring needed to clear a huge backlog of applications.  Obama said the law would give a boost to U.S. businesses, in part by giving the patent office the funding it needs to catch up on the backlog of nearly 675,000 patent applications.  “It’s a bill that will put a dent in the huge stack of patent applications waiting for review. It will help startups and small business owners turn their ideas into products three times faster than they can today,” Obama said at a signing ceremony carried on television.  “And it will improve patent quality and help give entrepreneurs the protection and the confidence they need to attract investment to grow their businesses and to hire more workers.”  While the administration has repeatedly pushed the measure as a jobs bill, some members of the patent community are skeptical of any direct effects.  “As for manufacturing or industry hiring lots of workers, I think that may be a little bit overblown,” said Bernard Codd, an attorney with McDermott Will & Emery. “I think it’s going to depend more on the national economy picking up. This may be a piece of the puzzle.”  In a rare show of bipartisanship, the Democrat-controlled Senate voted on September 8 to approve a version of the legislation that had come from the Republican-held House of Representatives.  Similar to a measure sponsored by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, the measure won praise from Republicans such as House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Representative Darrell Issa, himself a patent holder.  The patent overhaul began at the urging of the tech industry, which makes devices containing hundreds of patented technologies and has faced growing numbers of patent infringement lawsuits.  There was initial opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, whose products often rely on a single patent, but the bill went through many changes. Eli Lilly and Co Chief Executive John Lechleiter attended the signing ceremony at a northern Virginia high school, the White House said.  The tech industry had sought to cut the number of infringement cases filed by patent-licensing companies which do not make products and are sometimes derided as “patent trolls.”  One portion of the new law places limits on who can be named as respondents in a single lawsuit, a measure aimed at these patent-holding companies.  “Some of these lawsuits name 50 or even 100 defendants,” said Colleen Chien, who teaches patent law at Santa Clara Law School. Chien said the law would reduce that problem.  The measure would also grant patents to the first inventors to file, rather than requiring inventors to show they were the first to develop an innovation. The change will make it easier for companies who file for patents in numerous countries.  One goal of the bill is to give the patent office more resources so it will do a better job of assessing patent applications, with the idea that rejecting bad patents will head off some litigation.  There were 2,296 patent lawsuits in 2000 in U.S. district courts. That number rose 23 percent to 2,833 in 2010, according to Joshua Walker, head of Lex Machina, which tracks patent litigation. In addition, the number of defendants per lawsuit rose, from an average of two in 2000 to three in 2010.  The legislation is designed to end the practice of fees paid to the patent office being diverted to the U.S. Treasury. There is some skepticism, however, among the ranks of patent holders that lawmakers — desperate to reduce budget deficits — will live up to pledges to end the diversion.  The law will also allow anyone — including a company’s rivals — to scrutinize newly granted patents and give the patent office evidence to show why it should not be allowed.  Half of the patents challenged in court are invalidated, which means they never should have been issued, says Daniel Ravicher, who teaches at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law.

122,INTC,EU probing if Google dominates Internet search,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU regulators are still undecided whether Google dominates in Internet search and if it has abused rivals in breach of competition rules, the EU’s antitrust chief said on Friday.  The European Commission opened an investigation into Google in November last year after rivals, including Microsoft, accused the company of abusing its dominant position in the market for web search services.  “As part of our current investigation, we are trying to determine whether the company holds a dominant position in Internet search,” EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia told a competition conference in Florence.  “Google is the browser of choice for very many of us; but dominance is not the same as abuse of dominance. Abuse is a conduct that protects or extends dominance by illegitimate means, and we still have to conclude whether this is the case for Google,” he said.  Google is the world’s most popular search engine with more than 90 percent of the global market, according to Internet statistics firm StatCounter.  Its Chrome web browser had 22 percent of the global market in July, Microsoft’s Internet Explorer had 42.5 percent while Mozilla’s Firefox had 28 percent.  Google faces nine antitrust complaints filed with EU regulators, sources told Reuters last month, as rivals turned up the heat on the firm.

124,INTC,"Rambus: Hynix, Micron conspired to block chips","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microchip heavyweights Micron Technology Inc and Hynix Semiconductor Inc conspired to squelch Rambus Inc’s superior chip technology and keep it from becoming an industry standard, a Rambus lawyer argued in court on Monday.  Rambus’ rivals countered in closing arguments in California state court that its “RDRAM” memory chip technology failed simply because it was inferior.  The three semiconductor corporations have waged a legal battle for years, with Rambus suing to claim some $3.95 billion in lost profits. That figure was scaled back from $4.38 billion after Rambus accepted the defendants’ arguments that discounts would have applied.  Rambus’s RDRAM chip, used in personal computers, had been in close competition with Micron and Hynix products from the late 1990s, said attorney Sean Eskovitz.  “RDRAM should have won this race, but the defendants cheated,” he said. Micron and Hynix conspired to lower their prices and drive Rambus out of the market, he added.  “It’s not just unfair, it’s unlawful.”  Rambus has also accused Micron and Hynix of boycotting its memory technology, according to the lawsuit. Micron, Hynix and Samsung colluded to restrict production and raise the price of Rambus chips in favor of their own technology, to the detriment of consumers, the lawsuit alleges.  Rambus settled its antitrust claims against Samsung last year in a deal worth up to $900 million.  In court, Eskovitz cited memos from Intel Corp saying Rambus’s technology was superior. And he played video of Micron Chief Sales Executive Mike Sandler testifying that he had had “improper” conversations with Hynix.  In an earlier lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice, Hynix pleaded guilty to price-fixing, he added.  Micron and Hynix, who will continue closing arguments on Tuesday, deny any anti-competitive conduct and say Rambus had encountered technical and design issues that prevented its technology’s wider adoption.  Hynix’s attorneys said that Intel had given up on Rambus’s RDRAM in 1999 in favor of SDRAM — before the alleged collusion against Rambus had taken place. SDRAM became the widely adopted industry standard.  “Rambus’s choices doomed this product,” argued Hynix attorney Kenneth Nissly.  Unable to compete fairly, the company decided to pursue lawsuits against its competitors and partners, he said.  Earlier in the trial, the defendants had argued that RDRAM used more electricity and generated more heat, assertions that Rambus’s witnesses disputed.  Much of Rambus income comes from patent licensing, and it has initiated litigation against a range of tech companies. Winning patent cases makes it easier for Rambus to negotiate additional licensing arrangements.  Its shares often gyrate in tandem with major court decisions. On Monday, they closed up 0.9 percent at $13.39.  The case in Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Francisco is Rambus Inc. v. Micron Technology Inc. et al, 04-431105.

127,INTC,Microsoft boosts dividend 25 percent,"(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp announced a 25 percent increase in its quarterly dividend on Tuesday to 20 cents per share, as the technology giant hands more cash back to shareholders frustrated with its stagnant share price.  The increase, following a 23 percent hike last year, is on the high-end of the range expected by Wall Street, but still may disappoint some investors hoping for a greater payout from Microsoft’s $53 billion pile of cash and short-term investments.  Shares of Microsoft rose 12 cents to $27.10 in extended trading on Tuesday.  The latest increase, payable on December 8 to shareholders of record as of November 15, 2011, means Microsoft’s dividend yield is now about 3 percent.  That puts it in the mid-range of comparable large tech firms, with Intel Corp hovering around 4 percent and IBM Corp at around 1.8 percent. Cisco, which introduced a dividend earlier this year, is at around 1.5 percent. Google Inc and Apple Inc do not pay dividends.  A regular dividend is generally regarded as a mark of a mature company that cannot match earlier growth rates or stock gains, and tends to attract more conservative investors.  Despite explosive growth in the 1990s, Microsoft finds itself in that category, with a share price essentially unchanged for the past decade.  Microsoft, which went public in 1986, paid its first annual dividend in 2003. The following year it issued a special dividend of $3 per share — shelling out more than $30 billion in one go — and started paying a quarterly dividend, which it has raised in increments most years since then.

129,INTC,Dealtalk: Microsemi must raise Zarlink bid or lose to rival,"(Reuters) - A C$550 million hostile bid for specialty chipmaker Zarlink will likely fail as investors wait for predator Microsemi to raise its bid, or for a friendly suitor to emerge.  Microsemi’s C$3.35/share bid expires at 5 pm EDT on Thursday. But with the stock at C$3.46 a share, there is little chance of people tendering.  “We would not choose to tender,” said Jeff Mo, a portfolio manager whose firm Mawer Investment Management is the sixth-largest Zarlink shareholder, with a 2.4 percent stake.  “Given the high liquidity in the stock, investors would likely sell their shares into the market today rather than tender to a lower offer tomorrow.”  Microsemi would have the option of walking away, extending its bid, or raising it, but it is not seen taking the final option as long as there are no rival bids.  Zarlink designs mixed-signal chip technology for communications and medical applications. Analysts say the medical business is poised for growth, making the company an attractive acquisition target in the largely consolidated semiconductor industry.  The company says Microsemi Corp’s offer is too low, and expects talks with at least 15 other potential suitors to produce a better deal.  Neither Zarlink nor Microsemi could be reached for comment on Wednesday.  Zarlink has played its cards close to its chest since Microsemi filed its bid on August 17. And while Zarlink Chairman Adam Chowaniec has not named names, the market suspects big industry names may want to buy some or all of the company.  Several industry giants are either involved in or entering the medical device technology area where Zarlink seeks to grow. They include Intel, Texas Instruments, Qualcomm and Integrated Device Technology.  Microsemi has been courting Zarlink since January.  Before it took its hostile offer to shareholders, it said it might pay as much as C$3.55 a share for Zarlink under certain conditions, although it indicated more recently that it might walk away when the current offer expires.  Few expect the saga to end that easily.  “I still think there’s a high probability you’ll see a white knight step up,” said an industry analyst who preferred not to be named.  Failing that, he said “the expectation is that if Zarlink can’t line up a friendly buyout, they might go friendly (with Microsemi) at C$3.55.”  Zarlink said last week that Microsemi was going to challenge a shareholder rights plan it put in place to defend against hostile takeover.  That issue won’t go before regulatory authorities until early October, however, signaling Microsemi may extend its offer on Thursday so it can bide its time to see if another bid emerges.  “We are still quite confident that a higher bid will eventually emerge,” said shareholder Mo.

They include Intel (INTC.O), Texas Instruments TXN.N, Qualcomm (QCOM.O) and Integrated Device Technology (IDTI.O).   Microsemi has been courting Zarlink since January.   Before it took its hostile offer to shareholders, it said it might pay as much as C$3.55 a share for Zarlink under certain conditions, although it indicated more recently that it might walk away when the current offer expires.   Few expect the saga to end that easily.   “I still think there’s a high probability you’ll see a white knight step up,” said an industry analyst who preferred not to be named.   Failing that, he said “the expectation is that if Zarlink can’t line up a friendly buyout, they might go friendly (with Microsemi) at C$3.55.”   Zarlink said last week that Microsemi was going to challenge a shareholder rights plan it put in place to defend against hostile takeover.   That issue won’t go before regulatory authorities until early October, however, signaling Microsemi may extend its offer on Thursday so it can bide its time to see if another bid emerges.   “We are still quite confident that a higher bid will eventually emerge,” said shareholder Mo.

131,INTC,Microsoft boosts dividend 25 percent,"(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp announced a 25 percent increase in its quarterly dividend on Tuesday to 20 cents per share, as the technology giant hands more cash back to shareholders frustrated with its stagnant share price.  The increase, following a 23 percent hike last year, is on the high-end of the range expected by Wall Street, but still may disappoint some investors hoping for a greater payout from Microsoft’s $53 billion pile of cash and short-term investments.  Shares of Microsoft rose 12 cents to $27.10 in extended trading on Tuesday.  The latest increase, payable on December 8 to shareholders of record as of November 15, 2011, means Microsoft’s dividend yield is now about 3 percent.  That puts it in the mid-range of comparable large tech firms, with Intel Corp hovering around 4 percent and IBM Corp at around 1.8 percent. Cisco, which introduced a dividend earlier this year, is at around 1.5 percent. Google Inc and Apple Inc do not pay dividends.  A regular dividend is generally regarded as a mark of a mature company that cannot match earlier growth rates or stock gains, and tends to attract more conservative investors.  Despite explosive growth in the 1990s, Microsoft finds itself in that category, with a share price essentially unchanged for the past decade.  Microsoft, which went public in 1986, paid its first annual dividend in 2003. The following year it issued a special dividend of $3 per share — shelling out more than $30 billion in one go — and started paying a quarterly dividend, which it has raised in increments most years since then.

132,INTC,Rambus faithful set up verdict vigil,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Pat Hughes left the bar he owns in New York City, flew across the country and showed up at 4:45 a.m. Wednesday morning to stand in line.  He wasn’t trying to buy tickets to the Super Bowl or a Lady Gaga concert or shop at a holiday sale. Rather he wanted to be sure of getting a seat in a stuffy courtroom where lawyers would spend hours expounding on the minutiae of semiconductor technology.  Such is the dedication of investors in Rambus Inc, which for a decade has been fighting to prove that titans of industry conspired to steal its patents, fix prices and drive it out of business. Closing arguments ended Wednesday in Rambus’s lawsuit against Micron Technology Inc and Hynix Semiconductor Inc after more than three months of testimony.  Investors such as Hughes have descended on the California Superior Court in San Francisco to watch their side do battle — and perhaps make a last-minute trade.  “It’s the David vs. Goliath thing,” said Hughes, 46. “And so many of us have lost so much of our investment.”  Billions of dollars are at stake. Rambus is asking for $3.95 billion in damages, which by California law would be instantly tripled, as well as unspecified punitive damages. Such an award could dramatically change the fortune of a company worth $1.46 billion in market capitalization as of Wednesday.  The company’s shares often gyrate in tandem with major court decisions. For example, in January 2007 Rambus shares gained 9 percent after a favorable ruling in a case involving Hynix.  And the shares dropped 18 percent in May this year when an appeals court ruled against Rambus in a case against Micron.  On Thursday, a half dozen of the Ramboids, as company followers call themselves, set up a vigil in the marble-floored corridor outside the courtroom, waiting for the jury to return.  Jim Rockwell of Orange, Connecticut, said he has followed the company’s fortunes since investing in 1999. A former software company owner, Rockwell said he was impressed by Rambus’ inventions, which he believes underlie much of the hardware now on the market. “Computer memory would be so much slower if it were not for what they did,” he said.  Rockwell, who also attended previous trials in California, Virginia and Washington, D.C., spent a week lining up at 6 a.m. for one of the coveted 42 seats in the courtroom. By Wednesday morning, the line stretched nearly a block, and anyone who arrived after 7 a.m. was relegated to following the online postings of the early birds.  The group shared donuts in line and many went out for dinner to pore over the closing arguments.  Lawyers for both sides focused on the reasons and the timing of the decision by the dominant microprocessor company, Intel Corp, to abandon Rambus’s memory product RDRAM in favor of SDRAM, which became the industry standard.  Rambus says South Korea’s Hynix and Idaho-based Micron colluded to fix prices of memory chips used in personal computers and prevent its technology from becoming widely used. It claims it lost billions of dollars in business.  Micron and Hynix argue that Rambus’s chip technology was plagued by technical problems and that the company blames competitors for its own failure.  Micron attorney William Price and Hynix attorney Kenneth Nissly displayed memos from Intel and other computer companies suggesting that Rambus’s arrogance had alienated its business partners. “Based on their view of the product, Rambus, and the changing market, Intel had decided not to have anything to do with Rambus,” said Price.  In rebuttal, Rambus attorney Bart H. Williams argued that Intel’s decision to switch from RDRAM to SDRAM came about only because it was harder to get RDRAM. “It was all about price and availability,” he said.  Much of Rambus income comes from patent licensing, and it has initiated litigation against a range of tech companies. Winning patent cases makes it easier for Rambus to negotiate additional licensing arrangements.  The case in Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Francisco is Rambus Inc. v.

134,INTC,Zarlink accepts sweetened Microsemi takeover bid,"(Reuters) - Microsemi Corp MSCC.O has reached a friendly agreement to buy Canadian specialty chipmaker Zarlink Semiconductor Inc ZL.TO, ending a hostile standoff with a sweetened deal worth $632 million that will bolster Microsemi’s medical technology product portfolio.  California-based Microsemi, which had courted Zarlink since January, said it will pay C$3.98 for each Zarlink share, or 19 percent more than its earlier C$3.35 bid, which Zarlink had rejected.  The total transaction value is $525 million, net of Zarlink’s cash of $107 million, Microsemi said.  After the announcement, Zarlink shares jumped 14 percent at the market open to C$3.94. The stock had hit a one-year low of C$1.55 last November, and in March 2009 it was worth just 21 Canadian cents.  Ottawa-based Zarlink designs mixed-signal chip technology for communications and medical applications, a sector that is widely viewed as poised for strong growth in an otherwise largely consolidated semiconductor industry.  The deal helps Microsemi diversify its revenue stream, almost 40 percent of which comes from the defense market, said Tore Svanberg, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.  “There is a lot of nervousness about defense budgets and things like that, so longer term, I think Microsemi is just trying to be prudent,” he said.  Several industry giants are either involved in or entering the medical device technology area, including Intel (INTC.O), Texas Instruments TXN.N, Qualcomm (QCOM.O) and Integrated Device Technology (IDTI.O).  “I expected a higher bid, I just expected it to come from somebody else,” said BMO Capital Markets analyst Brian Piccioni.  Before reaching the friendly deal with Microsemi, Zarlink said it had talked to at least 15 other potential suitors interested in buying the company in its entirety or in part.  But Zarlink never said which companies it was talking to, and Microsemi had not been expected to raise its bid unless another, higher offer surfaced.  “Entering the process and performing diligence enabled us to confirm the compelling strategic fit between the two companies,” Microsemi Chief Executive Jim Peterson said in announcing the deal on Thursday.  Under the terms of the deal, Microsemi agreed to pay C$1,624.49 per C$1,000 principal amount of debentures, also a 19 percent increase over an earlier offer.  Zarlink was not available for immediate comment.  “I think that most shareholders will be quite pleased with the turn of events,” Piccioni said.

136,INTC,Tech firms to invest $4.4 bln in upstate New York," ALBANY, N.Y., Sept 27 (Reuters) - A group of five technology firms will invest $4.4 billion in New York State in an effort to develop a new generation of computer chips, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced on Tuesday.  The companies which signed an agreement with New York are Intel (INTC.O), IBM (IBM.N), GLOBALFOUNDRIES [CSMF.UL], TSMC (2330.TW) and Samsung (005930.KS).   The investment could keep or create about 7,000 jobs upstate, Cuomo said in a statement, adding that no private company would receive any state funds.   “This unprecedented private investment in New York’s economy will create thousands of jobs and make the state the epicenter for the next generation of computer chip technology,” Cuomo said.   Under an agreement between the state and the firms, New York will kick in $400 million over five years to the State University of New York’s College for Nanoscale and Science Engineering (CNSE) in Albany.   The state’s investment will be directed entirely to CNSE, and all tools and equipment acquired will be owned by CNSE.   New research and development facilities will be located in Albany, Canandaigua, Utica, East Fishkill and Yorktown Heights.   Two projects make up most of the investment. The first will focus on making the next generation of computer chips while the second will focus on changing existing production over to the new technology.   Tuesday’s announcement came as 10 newly created regional development councils began to debate economic development initiative ideas. On a radio show on Monday, Cuomo said “plans with a high degree of predictability” would be rewarded with grants and tax credits.

137,INTC,AMD cuts Q3 rev view on supply issues; shares fall,"(Reuters) Advanced Micro Devices Inc cut its third-quarter revenue and gross margin forecast citing manufacturing issues at its German foundry supplier.  Shares of the company fell 10 percent to $5.56 in extended trading on Wednesday.  The company forecast third-quarter revenue to be 4-6 percent higher than the second quarter. It had earlier forecast 10 percent growth, and plus or minus 2 percent to that.  AMD, like larger rival Intel Corp, manufactures chips for a range of electronic devices. The company’s ‘Llano’ range of chips were launched in June and were built for mainstream desktops and laptops. The chips are built in two sizes — 32 nanometer and 45 nanometer.  The company said the revenue forecast cut was mainly due to 32 nm yield, ramp and manufacturing issues at Globalfoundries’ German factory that limited the supply of its Llano chips.  AMD also said 45 nm supply was less than expected due to difficulties related to the use of common tools across technology nodes.  The chipmaker, which cut its gross margin forecast to 44-45 percent, said the shortfall was due to lesser-than-expected supply of Llano and associated products with higher average selling prices.  The company said longer-than-expected delays in shipments of its next-generation Interlagos server processor will also affect margins.

139,INTC,"CORRECTED - UPDATE 2-Intel, Google unveil Android mobile partnership"," (In story that ran on Sept. 13 Corrects to “Intel chips” from “Google chips” in fourth paragraph)   * Aim is to quicken Intel’s mobile efforts   * Early days yet to declare winners, losers   (Adds details from conference, experts’ comments)   By Alexei Oreskovic   SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Google Inc (GOOG.O) launched a development partnership on Tuesday, the latest effort by the world’s dominant maker of PC microprocessors to break into the booming smartphone market.   The two companies will work together to optimize future versions of Google’s Android mobile software for Intel’s “Atom” processors, hoping to speed the development and time-to-market of future Intel-powered smartphones.   The move could jump-start Intel’s efforts to expand into the market for mobile phones and touchscreen tablet devices at a time when sales of PCs are slowing.   The first Android phones featuring Intel chips should be available in the first half of 2012, Intel executives said at the company’s annual developer conference in San Francisco on Tuesday.   Intel is allying itself with one of the biggest players in the mobile industry. In August, Google announced plans to acquire mobile phone maker Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion.   And Android software, which Google licenses free to manufacturers, is currently the most popular smartphone software, ahead of Apple’s (AAPL.O) iOS as well as software by Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Research in Motion RIM.TO.   While Intel is the world’s No. 1 maker of PC microprocessors, it has struggled to gain a foothold in the new class of mobile gadgets such as smartphones and tablets.   Today’s crop of smartphones, from the iPhone to devices based on Android software, use chips from companies like Texas Instruments TXN.N and Samsung (005930.KS) which in turn license technology from ARM Holdings ARM.L.   Those chips are considered more power efficient than Intel’s — a key factor for handheld, battery-powered devices.   But Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini, speaking at the conference, said the smartphone market is still in its early stages.   “The smartphone business is not established in terms of the ultimate shakeout of who’s going to win and who is going to lose,” Otellini said during a chat with reporters following his keynote speech.   “You saw what happened in terms of how fast Android took share from Apple,” he said. “So good products on good platforms can really still make a big difference in this industry.”   While Android technically already could support Intel chips, the new partnership will make it much easier for a manufacturer to bring an Intel-based Android phone to market.   Until now, it has been up to phone manufacturers to make their Android phones compatible with Intel chips, whereas future versions of the Android software will work with Intel chips right out of the gate, and will be optimized to take advantage of Intel’s technology.   “It’s really about Google saying that Intel is going to be a first-class citizen in the Android ecosystem,” said David Kanter, an analyst with Real World Technologies.   But he added that Intel still needs to win over hardware makers if it hopes to succeed in the smartphone market.   Otellini also again highlighted his confidence in the new “ultrabook” computing market during Tuesday’s speech, saying the lighter, sleeker laptops should hit store shelves starting this holiday season.

140,INTC,Samsung joins forces with Intel and Microsoft,"(Reuters) - Samsung Electronics unveiled on Wednesday software pacts with Intel and Microsoft as the world’s No.2 cellphone maker strengthens its mobile software push.  Samsung has quickly become one of the largest smartphone makers globally, helped by its strong offering of devices using Google’s Android platform.  Analysts said Wednesday’s deals signaled Samsung’s aim to lower its exposure to Android following Google’s $12.5 billion August acquisition of Motorola Mobility.  “The Google Motorola deal certainly gives Samsung some motivation to lessen the dependence on Android,” said Matthew Thornton, analyst at Avian Securities.  Microsoft and Samsung signed on Wednesday a new deal for development and marketing of Windows phones, while also agreeing on a wide patent cross-licensing deal. Samsung has also used Microsoft’s software in the past.  Earlier on Wednesday two Linux software groups, one backed by Samsung, another by Intel, said they have joined forces to develop a new operating system for cellphones and other devices.  Under the deal, the LiMo Foundation and Linux Foundation are effectively merging their LiMo and Meego mobile operating systems and hope to gain wider industry and consumer support, but analysts said the new Tizen platform is likely to struggle.  It would have to attract wide support from developers and manufacturers to compete with the dozen or so other mobile operating systems available in a smartphone market currently dominated by Apple’s in-house software and Google’s Linux-based Android.  “The best hope for them is that big operators get worried by Android ... and decide to consciously switch their allegiances to rival platforms to restrict Google’s huge influence over the mobile market,” said analyst Neil Mawston from Strategy Analytics.  Earlier this year Nokia, the biggest phone maker by volume, ditched its own Symbian operating system in favor of Microsoft’s Windows Phone software.  Currently Windows Phone has a smartphone market share of 2-3 percent, according to industry analysts, and LiMo and Meego have less than 1 percent apiece, while Android’s share is almost 50 percent and still growing.  “This (Tizen) is driven by necessity. Linux rivals to Android have failed to gain traction and Samsung needs to reduce its dependence on Google,” said Geoff Blaber, an analyst at London-based telecoms industry consultancy CCS Insight.  The world’s second-biggest cellphone maker behind Nokia, Samsung is the leading user of the Android platform, which has been one of the reasons for its escalating court-room fight over patents with Apple.  Microsoft said the definitive agreement with Samsung to cross-license the patent portfolios of both companies, provides  broad coverage for each company’s products, and it will get royalties for Samsung’s devices running the Android platform.  “It’s probably a win-win. Microsoft is leveraging its patents to get customers while Samsung is looking for ways to lessen its dependence on Android,” said Avian’s Matthew Thornton.  LiMo Foundation and the Linux Foundation said the new Tizen platform is an open-source, standards-based software platform that supports multiple devices including smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, netbooks and in-vehicle ‘infotainment’ systems.  A spokesman for Samsung said: “We’ve been a core Linux partner ... and this is in line with our strategy of supporting many platforms.”  The initial release is planned for the first quarter of 2012, enabling the first devices using Tizen to come to market in mid-2012, the two groups said.  The world’s largest semiconductor firm Intel and Samsung Electronics, the second biggest maker of cell phones and one of the key contributors to LiMo, will head the technical steering committee developing Tizen.  Earlier this month Intel and Google launched a development partnership to adapt Android for Intel’s Atom processor chips, with a view to having the first Anroid phones featuring Intel chips in the first half of next year.  Linux is the most popular type of free, or open-source, computer operating system which allows the public to use, revise and share. Linux suppliers earn money selling improvements and technical services.

Currently Windows Phone has a smartphone market share of 2-3 percent, according to industry analysts, and LiMo and Meego have less than 1 percent apiece, while Android’s share is almost 50 percent and still growing.	   “This (Tizen) is driven by necessity. Linux rivals to Android have failed to gain traction and Samsung needs to reduce its dependence on Google,” said Geoff Blaber, an analyst at London-based telecoms industry consultancy CCS Insight.	   The world’s second-biggest cellphone maker behind Nokia  , Samsung is the leading user of the Android platform, which has been one of the reasons for its escalating court-room fight over patents with Apple.    	  Microsoft said the definitive agreement with Samsung to cross-license the patent portfolios of both companies, provides   broad coverage for each company’s products, and it will get royalties for Samsung’s devices running the Android platform. 	   “It’s probably a win-win. Microsoft is leveraging its patents to get customers while Samsung is looking for ways to lessen its dependence on Android,” said Avian’s Matthew Thornton.	   LiMo Foundation and the Linux Foundation said the new Tizen platform is an open-source, standards-based software platform that supports multiple devices including smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, netbooks and in-vehicle ‘infotainment’ systems.	   A spokesman for Samsung said: “We’ve been a core Linux partner ... and this is in line with our strategy of supporting many platforms.”	   The initial release is planned for the first quarter of 2012, enabling the first devices using Tizen to come to market in mid-2012, the two groups said.	   The world’s largest semiconductor firm Intel and Samsung Electronics, the second biggest maker of cell phones and one of the key contributors to LiMo, will head the technical steering committee developing Tizen.	   Earlier this month Intel and Google launched a development partnership to adapt Android for Intel’s Atom processor chips, with a view to having the first Anroid phones featuring Intel chips in the first half of next year.

146,INTC,"Intel Capital says India tech startup valuations ""near-bubble""","MUMBAI (Reuters) - Intel Capital, the investment arm of Intel Corp (INTC.O), the world’s biggest chipmaker, believes valuations of early-stage technology companies in India have reached a “near-bubble” stage, as too much capital chases too few quality opportunities.  “It’s crazy. I am not drawing parallels, but it feels like ‘99 in the U.S.,” said Sudheer Kumar Kuppam, managing director for Asia Pacific at Intel Capital.  “This is not a good sign. Most of the time, we evaluate companies and we have to leave it at that stage as we feel valuations were too high,” Kuppam told Reuters during a visit to India’s financial capital.  Big valuation expectations in the global tech sector are being driven in part by much-anticipated initial public offerings planned by U.S. firms such as Groupon and Zynga, although market weakness in recent months has cooled that excitement.  U.S.-based Intel Capital normally picks up stakes of less than 20 percent in early stage companies, with an average deal size of $5 million. Its $250 million India fund has made about $40 million in investments so far this year, including $20 million for stakes in six small firms announced on Friday.  While corporate culture in India is historically family driven, with company owners reluctant to bring in private equity investors, the software and technology start-ups that are mushrooming in the country tend to be more willing to sell stakes to outsiders.  “We are seeing plenty of entrepreneurs taking the step, seeing the opportunity and past successes,” Kuppam said, referring to companies bringing in venture capital.  “You can see every Silicon Valley v.c. (venture capital) fund has an office in India,” he said.  Private equity investments in India rose 21.6 percent  in the first half of this year to $3.3 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.

148,INTC,Intel acquires Israeli mobile navigation firm Telmap,"TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel Corp has agreed to acquire mobile navigation software maker Telmap, the chief executive of the Israel-based company said on Sunday.  Details of the deal were not disclosed but Israeli media said Intel is paying about $300 million to $350 million.  Telmap CEO Oren Nissim declined to comment on the price and said the deal was expected to close before the end of the year.  Telmap will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Intel, which has two plants and four development centers in Israel, and will retain its brand, management and 210 employees.  “The unique thing about this transaction is that here comes a giant and says ‘We really like what you’re doing, we believe in your strategy, we want to enhance and go forward. We’re not here to swallow you up,’” Nissim told Reuters.  Teaming up with Intel will enable Telmap to provide a “true alternative” to offerings from giants such as Nokia and Google, Nissim said.  “I think to a large extent that from a strategic perspective came the only company that could have come,” he said of Intel.  Intel expects Telmap to become much bigger and reach places it hasn’t before, whether it be in Europe, Asia-Pacific or the United States, Nissim said, adding Telmap will stay in Israel but expects to recruit workers abroad.  Peter Riddle, general manager of Intel’s AppUp developer program, in a blog posted at AppUp’s annual gathering of developers in Seattle, said the deal was a step toward expanding Intel’s mobile software services capabilities.  “Telmap delivers great multi-platform consumer experiences every day, and we’re looking forward to combining that focus and excellence with Intel’s to significantly grow their business,” he wrote.  “But Telmap isn’t just a great consumer service provider — with Telmap we can directly provide developers with location-based services spanning devices, operating systems and CPU architectures.”  Telmap, which offers location-based services to provide details on traffic data, speed cameras and local offerings, expects to post revenue of $33 million in 2011 and be profitable for the second consecutive year.  Intel, the world’s No. 1 chipmaker, has become a larger provider of software and services following its acquisitions of McAfee and Wind River.  “In mobility Intel fully understands that consumers are after where value is being created for them, which is at software, services, content,” Nissim said.  “Many things in mobility are happening around a person’s whereabouts. A lot of application developments are being done and Intel wants to be close to that pillar,” he said.  In addition to its core business, Telmap will open up its platform to third-party developers who will be able to enhance their applications with location-based services, Nissim said.

Prosecutors have called for a prison sentence of about 20 years or more for the central figure in what they describe as the biggest probe of insider trading at hedge funds on record. Defense lawyers suggest a much lower guidelines sentence of between 6-1/2 years and 8 years, or less.  The main arguments revolved around sharp disagreement over Rajaratnam’s millions of dollars in illicit profits, or losses avoided in pulling positions in stocks — based on inside tips — that he knew would fall in value.  The issue is key to what punishment U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell will impose on Rajaratnam. The hedge fund manager is set to be sentenced on October 13 under nonbinding federal guidelines that take the “loss amount” into account and can enhance or reduce a prison term.  Rajaratnam lawyer Terence Lynam argued that the guidelines refer to “gains resulting from the offense” and said the “court should isolate the gains from insider trading from other factors in the market” — one of the main differences between the calculations by the two sides.  “We don’t dispute that insider trading is a serious offense,” Lynam said as Rajaratnam sat in court looking straight ahead. “But the sentencing range overstates the seriousness of the offense here.”  Prosecutors and defense lawyers are so far apart on the issue that Holwell took the relatively unusual step of scheduling a separate hearing.  At Rajaratnam’s two-month-long trial, which ended in May with a sweeping conviction on 14 criminal charges, the government put the figure at $63.8 million in dozens of stocks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Google Inc and Intel Corp.  In court on Tuesday, a prosecutor said Rajaratnam’s insider trading gains could be as much as $72 million, but needed only to be $50 million to qualify Rajaratnam for an enhanced sentence under the guidelines.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Michaelson said government calculations showed about $30 million was made on mergers and acquisitions, $30 million from earnings announcements and $10 million in “loss avoidance” with the rest in other Galleon trades.  Defense lawyers estimated the amount at about $36.3 million, but argued on Tuesday that the money manager should be held responsible on personal gains of as little as $7.4 million. They said Rajaratnam’s Galleon trades should not be counted.  Galleon was wound down after Rajaratnam’s October 2009 arrest and all its investors were made whole.  Michaelson told the judge the parties were “close to an agreement” on the money Rajaratnam will forfeit, but he was not specific about the amount.  Holwell said he would announce his ruling on the gains at the sentencing proceeding.  Holwell is still due to rule before sentencing on a government request to make documents about Rajaratnam’s medical record public. Rajaratnam argues in pre-sentencing papers that he needs “life-sustaining medical care.” The ailments are not described. His lawyers say they should remain private.  Rajaratnam, 54, was convicted on evidence based largely on FBI phone taps in a broad probe that ensnared dozens of traders, lawyers and executives, most of whom pleaded guilty and chose not to exercise their right to a trial.  His lawyers have asked the judge to allow him to remain free on $100 million bail and under house arrest in his Manhattan apartment while he appeals his conviction.  They cited Rajaratnam’s health and his adherence to bail conditions since his arrest as reasons why he should not report to prison until the appeal process is completed.

157,INTC,IBM buys Q1 Labs to expand in security software,"(Reuters) - IBM Corp (IBM.N) will buy security software provider Q1 Labs as it looks to expand in a market which has seen recent high-profile cyber attacks on victims from Sony Corp (6758.T) to the British police.  Last year, Intel Corp (INTC.O) paid $7.68 billion for data security firm McAfee Inc, and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N) bought security software company ArcSight Inc for $1.5 billion.  Also on Tuesday, McAfee said it would buy NitroSecurity, a privately-owned provider of security information and event management tools. NitroSecurity and Q1 Labs, which is also privately owned, make software to help businesses analyze security logs and spot hacking threats and attacks.  IBM, which did not say how much it was paying for Q1 Labs, sees the security software and services business as a $94 billion market opportunity and has been buying analytics companies to beef up its security offerings.  In five years, it has spent more than $14 billion on 25 deals focused on analytics to help customers deal with the huge volumes of unstructured data from sources such as social media, biometrics and criminal databases.  In August, it bought British security analytics software firm i2, also for an undisclosed sum, and last month acquired Toronto-based risk analytics software firm Algorithmics for $387 million in cash.  Symantec Corp (SYMC.O), with a 19 percent share, dominated the global security software market — worth $14.7 billion by revenue — last year, according to research firm Gartner. McAfee followed with about a 10 percent share, ahead of Trend Micro (4704.T) and IBM, with 5 percent.

160,INTC,Intel acquires Israeli mobile navigation firm Telmap,"TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel Corp has agreed to acquire mobile navigation software maker Telmap, the chief executive of the Israel-based company said on Sunday.  Details of the deal were not disclosed but Israeli media said Intel is paying about $300 million to $350 million.  Telmap CEO Oren Nissim declined to comment on the price and said the deal was expected to close before the end of the year.  Telmap will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Intel, which has two plants and four development centers in Israel, and will retain its brand, management and 210 employees.  “The unique thing about this transaction is that here comes a giant and says ‘We really like what you’re doing, we believe in your strategy, we want to enhance and go forward. We’re not here to swallow you up,’” Nissim told Reuters.  Teaming up with Intel will enable Telmap to provide a “true alternative” to offerings from giants such as Nokia and Google, Nissim said.  “I think to a large extent that from a strategic perspective came the only company that could have come,” he said of Intel.  Intel expects Telmap to become much bigger and reach places it hasn’t before, whether it be in Europe, Asia-Pacific or the United States, Nissim said, adding Telmap will stay in Israel but expects to recruit workers abroad.  Peter Biddle, general manager of Intel’s AppUp developer program, in a blog posted at AppUp’s annual gathering of developers in Seattle, said the deal was a step toward expanding Intel’s mobile software services capabilities.  “Telmap delivers great multi-platform consumer experiences every day, and we’re looking forward to combining that focus and excellence with Intel’s to significantly grow their business,” he wrote.  “But Telmap isn’t just a great consumer service provider — with Telmap we can directly provide developers with location-based services spanning devices, operating systems and CPU architectures.”  Telmap, which offers location-based services to provide details on traffic data, speed cameras and local offerings, expects to post revenue of $33 million in 2011 and be profitable for the second consecutive year.  Intel, the world’s No. 1 chipmaker, has become a larger provider of software and services following its acquisitions of McAfee and Wind River.  “In mobility Intel fully understands that consumers are after where value is being created for them, which is at software, services, content,” Nissim said.  “Many things in mobility are happening around a person’s whereabouts. A lot of application developments are being done and Intel wants to be close to that pillar,” he said.  In addition to its core business, Telmap will open up its platform to third-party developers who will be able to enhance their applications with location-based services, Nissim said.

Today, my thoughts, and those of everyone at Nokia, are with the friends and family that he leaves behind.”	   “His capacity to revolutionise entire sectors of the economy by the power of imagination and technology is a source of inspiration for millions of engineers and entrepreneurs across the world. His efforts to render new technologies more attractive and simple to use have made a success of businesses that have changed the world of computing, the distribution of cultural content, telecommunications and even animated cinema.”	   “Today, we lost one of the most influential thinkers, creators and entrepreneurs of all time. Steve Jobs was simply the greatest CEO of his generation.”   “Steve, thank you for being a mentor and a friend. Thanks for showing that what you build can change the world.

163,INTC,ASML Q4 orders a beacon for tech sector,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Investors will focus on ASML’s fourth-quarter orders for signs of a recovery in the global chip sector when the Dutch chip equipment maker reports third-quarter results on Wednesday. ASML was expected to report a 22 percent rise in third-quarter net profit to 330 million euros ($450 million), a Reuters poll found, while sales were seen up 19 percent to 1.397 billion. A bellwether for Europe’s technology sector, ASML is the world’s largest maker of semiconductor lithography machines which map out electronic circuits on silicon wafers, competing with Japanese groups Canon and Nikon. Its order book development is seen as a barometer for expectations of big chipmakers such as Intel, the world’s largest, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the world’s biggest contract chipmaker. Victor Bareno, analyst at SNS Securities, said he expected a pick-up in ASML’s fourth-quarter orders from the third quarter, adding that since market conditions have not improved, orders will still be at depressed levels. What appeared to be a pause in orders for the chip equipment industry is turning into a full-blown downturn, said Bareno, adding he expected orders to bottom out by the end of 2011 and the chip market to recover during the first half of next year. ASML’s fourth-quarter order book was seen at 500-700 million euros — well below the record year-ago figure of 2.315 billion but above the indicated level for the third quarter, which the company said would not exceed 500 million euros. Global chipmakers and foundries have been battling falling demand as the industry was hit by economic uncertainties, supply chain disruptions due to the March earthquake in Japan, and customer inventory adjustments. Last month, research firm Gartner said semiconductor inventories were too high and it expected the sector to go through a moderate inventory correction during the coming few quarters with production and sell-through expected to return roughly to balance by the second quarter of 2012. Some chipmakers have reportedly said they will cut capital spending in 2012 amid low visibility in the sector and lower growth expectations in some chip markets next year. ASML chief executive Eric Meurice said on July 13 customers were taking “some time” to assess semiconductor end-demand trends for 2012 before making decisions about how and when they would determine capacity plans. Despite the expected drop in third-quarter orders, Meurice said at the time ASML’s 2011 sales would still be the best yet for the company, topping 5 billion euros. He was expected to reiterate this full-year sales target on Wednesday. Surging demand for smartphones and tablet computers are the bright spots for the chip sector at the moment as demand for desktop and laptop computers wanes. So, while Apple has prospered from demand for its iPads and iPhones, and the Galaxy smartphone series has become Samsung’s main profit engine, other firms with different chip requirements have not done so well. AU Optronics, LG Display, Micron Technology and Intel are among those that have recently trimmed outlooks for some products due to weaker demand. ASML has a global market share of around 70 percent and counts Intel, Samsung Electronics, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing among its customers.

165,INTC,UPDATE 4-ASML sees slowdown in chip sector,"* Q3 net profit 355 mln euros, above forecast 329.9 mln euros * Q3 revenues 1.459 bln euros, above forecast 1.397 bln euros * Q4 bookings seen above Q3 level of 514 mln euros * Confirms sees 2011 sales at record 5.5 billion euros * Shares up 0.7 pct at 1110 GMT By Roberta Cowan AMSTERDAM, OCT 12 - Dutch chip equipment maker ASML   said it saw signs of slowing growth in the semiconductor industry except in the technology needed to produce tablets and smartphones, and avoided making predictions for its own performance next year. A bellwether for Europe’s technology sector, ASML is the world’s largest maker of semiconductor lithography machines which map out electronic circuits on silicon wafers, competing with Japanese groups Canon and Nikon and counting Samsung Electronics , Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Intel among its customers. “I think 2012 will be a difficult year to say anything about right now; this is because we are listening to our customers,” said Chief Financial Officer Peter Wennink in a company video released with third-quarter results on Wednesday. Wennink added that the slowdown in the semiconductor industry was evident from ASML’s fourth-quarter order book. ASML, which has a global market share of about 70 percent, said it saw fourth-quarter orders above the third-quarter level of 514 million euros, but declined to be more specific. Analysts surveyed by Reuters had expected fourth-quarter bookings of between 500 and 700 million euros. ASML said customers were continuing to upgrade technology for chip manufacturing but wasn’t more specific about what orders it expected in the last three months of the year. Some analysts were relieved that orders were at least rising, rather than falling. “ASML’s third-quarter results are quite solid, with fourth-quarter order intake slightly better than expected,” said Victor Bareno from SMS Securities in Amsterdam, adding that the report gave “some confidence that ASML isn’t falling off a cliff.” ASML’s shares rose over 4 percent in early trade on Wednesday but by 1110 GMT had pared earlier gains, trading up 0.7 percent at 27.20 euros. “Even with the current high volatility and market conditions, I believe ASML has the visibility to improve the fourth-quarter order book by more than 100 million euros,” Bareno added. Other analysts were less optimistic. “For us to be relieved, we’d want to see a higher fourth-quarter order book and some visibility for next year,” said Richard Windsor from Nomura in London. “ASML is setting out a worst case scenario because basically we really don’t know what will happen next year. Technology upgrades will happen even if there’s no new demand, but they don’t know what will happen in 2012 as far as capacity expansion goes,” added Windsor. Wennink said ASML had become flexible enough to cut its cost base by up to 20 percent within six months, if necessary. ASML’s order book development serves as a barometer for the expectations of big chip makers such as Intel Corp , the world’s largest, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing  , the world’s biggest contract chip maker. “It is too early to understand how overall demand for semiconductors will contribute to our business in 2012, but we believe that a sustained need for leading-edge systems ... will likely result in increased fourth-quarter bookings, compared with Q3,” Chief Executive Eric Meurice said in a statement. Wennink said the smaller, faster, smarter chips found in the latest mobile devices including smartphones and tablet computers will continue to drive demand for the leading-edge equipment used for producing those smart chips. Industry experts estimate the most advanced chips found in tablets and smartphones amount to about 20 percent of the semiconductor sector. Global chip makers and foundries have been battling falling demand as the industry was hit by economic uncertainties, supply chain disruptions due to the March earthquake in Japan, and customer inventory adjustments. While Apple has prospered from demand for its iPads and iPhones, and the Galaxy smartphone series has become Samsung’s main profit engine, growth in the traditional personal computer market has plummeted. Last month, research firm Gartner said semiconductor inventories were too high and it expected the sector to go through a moderate inventory correction in the next few quarters with production and sell-through expected to return roughly to balance by the second quarter of 2012. Some chip makers have reportedly said they will cut capital spending in 2012 amid low visibility in the sector and lower growth expectations in some chip markets next year. ASML said it expects fourth-quarter sales to be above 1.1 billion euros. In the third quarter it made a net profit of 355 million euros, up 32 percent from a year ago, on sales up 24 percent at 1.459 billion euros. It reiterated its 2011 sales forecast of 5.5 billion euros. Intel is seen posting revenue at the low end of its forecast range when it releases third-quarter earnings on Tuesday.",10122011,http://www.reuters.com/article/asml/update-4-asml-sees-slowdown-in-chip-sector-idUSL3E7LC0QB20111012
166,INTC,PREVIEW-Cloud spending helps techs as PC sales stagger,"* IBM, Intel, Apple, Microsoft report next week * Cloud computing seen as big driver in down economy * PC sales limp along, hurts Microsoft, hardware makers By Bill Rigby and Noel Randewich Oct 14 (Reuters) - Big U.S. Internet computing companies should outshine their plainer PC cousins when earnings season kicks off next week, as corporations and fast-growing Web players dramatically accelerate their pace of hardware spending. Corporations are increasingly turning to new technology to make themselves more productive in a downtrodden global economy. Meanwhile, a social networking and e-commerce boom is spurring massive outlays on the giant server factories that power Internet computing. That’s good news for Intel Corp , which is supplying more of its microchips direct to companies building their own servers, and firms like EMC Corp and VMware whose businesses are integral to the storage and transmission of remote data, known as “cloud computing”. But it is less of a boon for traditional hardware makers such as Dell Inc and Hewlett Packard Co , which find themselves selling PCs at low margins and struggling to cope with an accelerating migration to smartphones and tablets. “The area of strength is still data centers, the cloud,” said Kevin Cassidy, chip analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “You have Facebook building out their data centers ... five football fields large.” Facebook, like online leaders Amazon.com and China’s Baidu , is buying masses of equipment to fill two major data centers in Oregon and North Carolina, but going straight to component makers like Intel for parts, rather than buying whole servers from HP or IBM . “It’s server demand, specifically emerging-market server demand,” said Evercore Partners analyst Patrick Wang, identifying growth areas. “Companies tied to the cloud and data centers are doing relatively better, there’s no question.” Apple Inc , which reports on Tuesday, continues to defy the economy and astound Wall Street by luring ever more consumers to buy its newest gadgets. But most other hardware companies are limping along, with little sign of a revival ahead. Worldwide PC sales barely rose more than 3 percent last quarter over last year’s numbers, according to the major research firms, as consumers stick with old machines or buy smartphones and tablets instead. Gartner last month cut its annual PC sales growth forecast to 3.8 percent, down from its previous projection of 9.3 percent. “I would not want to be in the hardware business right now,” said Michael Yoshikami, CEO of fund manager YCMNET Advisors. “Cloud companies are going to continue to accelerate, but PC companies generally are going to continue to suffer.” The knock-on effect hurts Intel’s traditional business of supplying chips for PCs, but it especially hits Microsoft Corp , which still relies on PC sales to keep its core Windows and Office products growing, despite making recent inroads into the cloud market with its server software and Azure developer platform. “I expect little or no growth from the consumer and I just want to know that companies are still spending for the refurbishment of the existing PC fleet,” said Kim Forrest, senior analyst at money manager Fort Pitt Capital Group, on Microsoft’s outlook. “If you are not hiring people, you don’t need to buy that extra PC. If it’s still kind of working, you’ll suffer through till the company has more money.” Wall Street is expecting a modest 9 percent rise in IBM’s quarterly net profit when it reports on Monday, and a 6 percent rise from Microsoft on Thursday. Intel, reporting on Tuesday, is expected to post a 12 percent increase. Apple, launching sales of its newest iPhone on Friday, is expected to post a whopping 57 percent jump in net profit. Only the smaller cloud-focused tech companies look close to rivaling that kind of growth rate. VMware, the small but fast-growing leader in projecting or “virtualizing” operating systems onto computers via the Internet, also reports earnings on Monday, with analysts’ predicting a 30 percent jump in net profit. “VMware is making a legitimate move to become the next major enterprise software stack,” said Jefferies & Co analyst Ross MacMillan, in a research note to clients earlier this month, putting a “buy” recommendation on the stock. “It is a bold strategy, but one with significant rewards if successful,” said MacMillan. The world’s biggest data storage equipment company, EMC, which owns the majority of VMware, reports on Tuesday, with analysts expecting a 27 percent jump in net profit. “I think companies with higher exposure to the cloud will do better,” said Cassidy at Stifel Nicolaus, citing small newcomers like Mellanox Technologies Ltd , which builds high-end networks connecting servers and storage devices. “You build these new high-speed servers and you need to have highways or networks that keep them connected at higher speeds.”",10142011,http://www.reuters.com/article/technology-earnings/preview-cloud-spending-helps-techs-as-pc-sales-stagger-idUSN1E79D0OG20111014
167,INTC,Firms urge action on skilled immigrant reform,"WASHINGTON/SANTA CLARA, California (Reuters) - When U.S. restrictions on work permits barred Intel from moving nearly 50 Finnish engineers to the United States this year, the microchip maker reluctantly parked them in a new research center in Finland. U.S. and multinational firms are chafing at delays and difficulties securing visas that effectively require them to keep high-skilled workers abroad instead of expanding operations in the United States. “Tech companies like ours follow where the action is and where the talent pools are,” said Young Sohn, chief executive of the semiconductor maker Inphi. That trend puts pressure on President Barack Obama to set aside his plan for a “comprehensive” overhaul of U.S. immigration policies — at the risk of angering key Hispanic voters — and fix the system of work permits and green cards for the likes of engineers and programmers. “America can’t afford to let high-skilled immigration reform remain attached to the controversies that surround comprehensive immigration reform more broadly,” executives advising Obama on jobs and competitiveness said this week. “Given the challenges our economy now faces in a global age, we all need to rethink,” the chief executives from GE, Boeing, DuPont and other firms said. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also wants quick action on skilled workers because of Capitol Hill’s resistance to the sweeping deal sought by Obama that would address undocumented workers and border security at the same time. “I’m not sure you can do this whole thing in one great big bunch,” Chamber President Thomas Donohue said. “We might have to do it a piece at a time. And this is the piece that we really ought to be able to get done in a big hurry.” Even with 9.1 percent of Americans unemployed, there are thousands of vacancies in the U.S. manufacturing sector because the U.S. labor force lacks the engineering, computing and math skills companies need. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the cumbersome process to secure visas for top foreign graduates in the United States contributed to “critical shortfalls” in the software industry as well as electronics, pharmaceuticals and aerospace. “Turning these students out of the country is, to put it bluntly, about the dumbest thing that we could possibly do,” he said. “We cannot afford to keep turning away those with skills that our country needs to grow and to succeed. It is sabotaging our own economy.” The United States caps H-1B skilled worker visas at 65,000 a year and often hits the maximum within months, leaving limited options for top-skilled foreign graduates and experts. And while it issues more than 1 million permanent residency “green cards” each year, only 15 percent are given for economic reasons to workers and their families, and those are subject to nationality quotas that pinch applicants from big countries. Intel, whose CEO Paul Otellini is a member of Obama’s jobs panel, learned in March that the annual cap had already been met for the permits it needed to move over the 50 engineers who previously had worked for Nokia. The specialists now work in a new R&D; center in Helsinki, but Intel said it would have preferred to have them do their mobile computing research in its U.S. facilities. “Intel’s R&D; and manufacturing hub is in the United States. It is important to our business group managers to have the flexibility to move individuals with specialized technical expertise to the U.S. to collaborate with existing Intel teams,” Intel’s staffing manager Idan Zu-Aretz said. Labor unions have expressed concern that companies hire foreign workers because they can do so at a lower salary than Americans would accept. But proponents of more skills-based immigration say the salary differential is overstated. They say immigrants tend to create jobs because they are twice as likely as U.S.-born people to start their own companies and can help improve access to foreign export markets. Obama is likely to tread carefully on the issue of foreign workers because of his preoccupation with reducing the U.S. jobless rate as part of his 2012 re-election campaign. Turning away from his “comprehensive” immigration approach could also alienate the Democrat from Hispanic voters who want to see help for the estimated 11 million undocumented workers and their families now in the United States. Cecilia Munoz, the top immigration policy official at the White House, said the prospects for immigration reform depended on Republicans in Congress, who supported a comprehensive fix under the Bush administration but have since cooled to it. “The challenge for anything in the immigration arena, including the broader immigration reform as a whole or any of these individual pieces, is the lack of bipartisan support,” she said in a recent interview. Scott Corley, head of the Compete America alliance of companies that includes Google, Wal-Mart and Cisco, said there was potential for piecemeal action on skilled immigration before the election. A bill introduced in the House of Representatives to eliminate green card nationality quotas may be able to clear Congress as a first step, Corley said. “It’s a technical fix that we could do today,” he said of the bill from Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz. He added there was possibility of amendments to other pieces of legislation working their way through Congress. “We do need a comprehensive reform to the system and we do support that, but the truth is it’s not going to happen any time soon,” he said.

169,INTC,UPDATE 5-Intel outlook defies worries of PC decline,"* Q4 outlook beats expectations * GAAP EPS 65 cents * Stock rises after hours  (Adds detail on outlook and Windows release; updates stock price) By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Intel Corp forecast quarterly revenue above Wall Street’s expectations, defying concerns that tablets and a shaky economy are eating into demand for personal computers. Intel shares moved sharply higher after the company beat earnings expectations and said developing countries like China are fueling expansion and helping make up for slower growth in the United States and Europe. “Guidance is well above consensus estimates, but below seasonality,” said Patrick Wang, an analyst at Evercore Partners. “They are giving us a realistic look at the fourth quarter and it seems like they are guiding conservatively.” Intel’s processors are used in 80 percent of the world’s PCs but the company has failed to gain traction in increasingly popular mobile gadgets like Google Inc’s Android smartphones and Apple Inc’s iPad, which some people are buying instead of laptops. Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said Intel’s outlook was a little lower than normal for this time of year, mostly because of weakness in Europe’s economy. Corporate information technology spending has held up in recent quarters despite the lackluster economy, helping sales of Intel’s high-margin server chips. Tech companies such as Facebook are also investing heavily to build out their computing capacity, helping data center sales for the world’s leading chipmaker rise 15 percent in the quarter. “Emerging markets are good, enterprise is strong, the mature market consumer is a little bit weaker,” Smith told Reuters. “I’d say Europe was a little bit weaker than the U.S.” In the third quarter, sales of Intel’s Atom mobile chips plummeted 32 percent, reflecting consumers’ growing preference for tablets over netbook PCs the Atom chips are widely used in. Shares of Intel have risen about 11 percent this year, outperforming the Nasdaq composite index, which has been flat. Analysts recommending the company say it has been punished too much for its lag in mobile computing and point to the stock’s 3.6 percent dividend yield. Intel said it spent $4 billion to buy back shares during the third quarter and authorized another $10 billion for more buybacks. The Santa Clara, California company is rushing to develop more energy efficient chips for tablets and phones although it is not expected to become competitive in mobile any time soon. It is also promoting Ultrabooks, a new super-thin category of laptops using Intel processors — similar to Apple’s MacBook Air. Early Ultrabook models, meant to combine the best features of tablets and laptops, may seem expensive to consumers, analysts say. But as new features are added to them, such as touchscreens and “instant on” capability, Intel expects the Ultrabooks to account for 40 percent of the consumer PC market by the end of next year. Chief Executive Paul Otellini told analysts on a conference call that the potential release of Microsoft Corp’s upcoming Windows 8 operating system next year could fuel higher PC sales and help Intel. Intel said revenue in the current quarter would be $14.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts’ average forecast was $14.23 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

171,INTC,Instant view: Apple shocks investors with earns miss,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Apple Inc shocked investors with a rare miss in its quarterly earnings on Tuesday, sending its shares down sharply. Earlier, strong demand for computers in China helped chip maker Intel Corp beat Wall Street’s sales targets, while Yahoo Inc struggled to revive its online advertising business. Following is immediate reaction from investors and analysts. “The company had a solid performance but given the heightened expectations, the shortfall will certainly lead to a sell-off in shares.” “Despite the miss, we still feel Apple is the primary beneficiary of the mobility wave sweeping through the technology sector. iPads were in line with our estimates and we expect that number to ramp as we enter the holiday season.” “We would attribute the iPhone weakness to delayed purchases. We are expecting a strong holiday quarter. Typically the company is conservative but it provided an above-consensus forecast.” CHANNING SMITH, CO-MANAGER, CAPITAL ADVISORS GROWTH FUND “Obviously the numbers are a disappointment by Apple standards but investors need to take a step back. It’s fairly easy to see a weakness with the iPhone. Obviously investors are going to debate the issue. We think there were a number of consumers who were deferring their purchase until the new model came out. It’s easily explained when you see 4 million iPhones sold in 3 days.” “Investors are going to start to speculate that there is change underway now that Jobs is gone and that there’s trouble ahead. We don’t share that point. The iPhone is where the weakness was and it’s an explainable one. The strong demand for the iPhone 4S set up strong demand for the holiday season.” “The earnings miss is a bit of a surprise — they are usually fairly conservative in terms of how they provide estimates. Next quarter you will see the bump. This quarter really suffered because people are basically waiting for the new phone.” “It’s a pretty big miss. It’s a miss they haven’t had in many years. It probably just signifies the company is in transition as they are rolling out a new product. And frankly the sentiment is so positive on Apple shares, the earnings estimates have been ratcheted up pretty significantly.” “I think it’s an opportunity to buy, with the shares having fallen.” “The biggest spotlight is the growth in Asia Pacific and Japan, which grew impressively considering Japan is still recovering from the earthquake.” “Another major spotlight is the shipment of Mac computers, which was significantly above my estimate. Despite the strength of iPad, Apple is not seeing a slowdown in Mac computer sales.” “The light shipment of iPhone is understandable considering many consumers were waiting for the iPhone 4S. The decline in iPod sales is also understandable. The iPad is still going strong and is still above my estimates. If you look at the outlook, it is very bullish and above my consensus. Apple is known to lowball its guidance and that may no longer be the norm here.” “What many have not realized is that Apple will start seeling an unlocked version of the 4S in November and that can address the prepaid market, customers outside the official carriers and further penetration in international market. It was announced when iPhone 4S sales began and there could be upside.” “There’s no question this was a transition quarter ahead of the 4S (the latest iPhone). But the iPad number was a little interesting because there wasn’t a transition there.” “I wouldn’t be surprised to see people buying shares because of the holiday season. With the early pace of iPhone 4S sales, my guess is that disappointment is relatively short-lived.” “I’m not going to call Q3 a throwaway quarter for iPhones but it was definitely transition. The Mac sales were strong.” “The numbers are actually quite good. The reason why the stock is off I think some of the analysts got carried away. We have seen this before. A couple of quarters ago analysts got carried away on the iPad side. They forgot there is a product transition.” “What is interesting is the guidance is less conservative than usual for their next quarter. It’s a timing issue where it looks like the business that people thought would be in the September quarter is occurring in the December quarter. One of the things obviously is the iPhone 4S just started shipping a few days ago.” “Expectations for this company were red-hot, that is why we downgraded it. Fifty-six brokers out there and everyone is saying ‘buy’.” “The reality is their business is not an annuity. They have to sell their quarter’s worth of revenue every 90 days. They had a big upgrade cycle with the iPhone, the numbers came in weak. They need to set records every time they report to keep the momentum.” “Apple has done something very unusual. They missed estimates and they are guiding above estimates for the next quarter. This is not what they typically do. They usually exceed estimates and give out easy guidance. We will have to wait and see more on this but the Nasdaq is likely to be impacted by this tomorrow.” “A couple of things they said that were fairly constructive: they delivered a pretty clean beat and raise. They really told us that things weren’t as bad as were feared in the third quarter. Fourth quarter guidance is well above consensus estimates, but below seasonality, which makes sense.” “They are giving us a realistic look at the fourth quarter and it seems like they are guiding conservatively, between 2 and 3 percent growth. Growth is historically up about 8 percent.” “Bottom line they delivered a beat and raise. They also authorized another $10 billion in stock buyback. This is in conjunction with the 4 percent dividend yield.

173,INTC,CORRECTED - UPDATE 2-Intel's quarterly outlook beats Street,"(Corrects GAAP vs Non-GAAP in second bullet point and fourth graph) * Q4 outlook beats expectations * GAAP EPS 65 cents * Stock rises after hours  (Adds earnings details) Oct 18 (Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) forecast quarterly revenue above Wall Street’s expectations, defying concerns that the growing popularity of tablets and a shaky economy are eating into demand for personal computers. Intel said revenue in the current quarter would be $14.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts on average had expected current-quarter revenue of $14.23 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Intel’s processors are used in 80 percent of the world’s PCs but the company has failed to gain traction in mobile gadgets like Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) iPad and Google Inc’s (GOOG.O) Android smartphones. It also increasingly depends on China and other emerging markets to make up for weak sales in the United States and Europe. GAAP net income in the third quarter was $3.5 billion, up 17 percent. Earnings per share were 65 cents. The world’s leading chipmaker said non-GAAP revenue in the third quarter was $14.3 billion, up 29 percent and higher than the $13.87 billion expected on average by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of Intel rose 2.6 percent in extended trade after closing up 0.52 percent at $23.40.

174,INTC,"Anlaysis: Intel's outlook, buybacks, add shine to shares","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Record earnings, a better-than-expected outlook and potential to buy back $10 billion in stock have put some shine back on the world’s top chipmaker although investors are wary of jumping in for the long haul. Stock in the world’s largest chipmaker has lagged its tech counterparts, punished by fears the longtime PC gargantuan is being left out of the mobile device boom. But stellar earnings this week lent credence to its argument that the PC market is still growing at a healthy rate. The question is for how long. At least for now, the Street is giving Intel — which hopes to get into mobile devices through its new Ultrabook initiative — the benefit of the doubt. Investors a little less worried that tablets and a shaky economy are eating in to demand for personal computers pushed Intel’s stock up 3.6 percent on Wednesday, bringing its gain this year to 16 percent, but it still looks cheap compared with other tech companies. “The reason the multiple isn’t greater than it is is there isn’t the sizzle of the next iPhone or the next iPad, that market-expanding opportunity into future, more touch-friendly devices,” said JMP analyst Alex Gauna, who recommends the stock. The Santa Clara, California company’s earnings and outlook beat expectations on Tuesday, as has become common in recent quarters, with demand for China helping offset weakness in Europe and helping deliver record cash flow. Intel also authorized $10 billion to buy back shares, which currently pay a dividend yield of over 3.5 percent. Shares of Intel trade at 10 times earnings, lower than an average of 14 for tech companies but better than Hewlett-Packard Co and Dell Inc, which also depend heavily on PC sales pinched by a lackluster economy and the growing popularity of tablets. One of a handful of analysts who do not recommend buying Intel, CLSA’s Srini Pajjuri is concerned that the company’s outlook for personal computer sales has been consistently higher than forecasts by market research groups in recent quarters. “My best guess at this point is that there’s an inventory build somewhere. Within the next one to two quarters I expect Intel (earnings) to underperform the market.” Intel’s processors are used in 80 percent of the world’s PCs but the company has failed to gain traction in mobile gadgets like Google Inc’s Android smartphones and Apple Inc’s iPad. Chips made by Samsung, Texas Instruments and Nvidia using an energy-efficient technology licensed by Britain’s ARM Holdings dominate the smartphone and tablet market. Proponents of ARM say its power-sipping architecture used to design its chips gives such a large advantage that Intel will be unable to dominate the mobile market. Competitors also plan to make inexpensive ARM chips for PCs — challenging Intel on its own turf. Intel says its formidable lead in manufacturing technology, letting it pack more transistors onto a silicon chip than its competitors can, will eventually allow it to deliver superior processors for mobile devices. Concerns that ARM, tablets and other mobile gadgets will decimate the PC market dominated by Intel, or at least cut in to the chip giant’s margins, are a key factor weighing on many investors. Intel is promoting Ultrabooks, a new super-thin category of laptops using Intel processors — similar to Apple’s MacBook Air. Early Ultrabook models, meant to combine the best features of tablets and laptops, may seem expensive to consumers, analysts say. But as they get new features, such as touchscreens and “instant on” capability, Intel expects the Ultrabooks to account for 40 percent of the consumer PC market by the end of next year. Gauna said it is tough to predict how technology advantages in the mobile market will play out down the road but sees Intel’s dependable cashflow and investor-friendly share buyback and dividends as reasons to own the stock now. “I don’t need the tablets or iPhones to make this an attractive investment today,” he said.

176,INTC,UPDATE 3-Intel shares jump on upbeat outlook,"* Baird ups price target on Intel to $32 from $29 * Intel benefited from supply shortages at AMD: analysts * Results defy industry view of muted PC growth: Stifel * Shares up 3.9 percent Oct 19 (Reuters) - Intel Corp shares rose nearly 4 percent on Wednesday, the day after the chipmaker forecast an upbeat fourth quarter that underscored its strength in emerging markets, and prompted at least seven brokerages to raise their price target on the stock. On Tuesday, Intel forecast fourth-quarter revenue above Wall Street’s expectations, defying concerns that tablets and a shaky economy are eating into demand for personal computers. Continued traction in developing economies, along with continued momentum in use of Cloud-related services and Windows 8’s potential will be the catalysts for Intel’s growth in 2012, Robert W. Baird said in a note to clients. Baird, which maintained its “outperform” rating on Intel, also expects the company to benefit from PC demand in developing economies. It raised its price target on the stock to $32 from $29. Intel shares were up 3.9 percent at $24.31 in morning Nasdaq trading. Earlier the stock rose to $24.48 — its highest level since 2008. Analysts say Intel also benefited from supply shortages at rival Advanced Micro Devices . JPMorgan analysts said that although Intel’s forecast was above Wall Street estimates, it was below normal seasonality due to a slowdown in Europe and mature markets, and customers maintaining lean inventory levels. Intel’s processors are used in about 80 percent of the world’s PCs. The company is also promoting Ultrabooks, a new super-thin category of laptops using Intel processors — similar to Apple’s MacBook Air. As the first-generation Ultrabooks are launched, Intel remains optimistic about their potential and thinks average selling prices can get to as low as $699 a year from now, UBS analyst Maynard Um wrote in a research note. Early Ultrabook models, meant to combine the best features of tablets and laptops, may seem expensive to consumers, analysts say. But as they get new features, such as touchscreens and “instant on” capability, Intel expects the Ultrabooks to account for 40 percent of the consumer PC market by the end of next year. The Santa Clara, California-based company also posted third-quarter earnings that beat expectations and said developing countries like China were fueling expansion. “These results continue to defy industry research estimates for muted PC unit growth,” Stifel analyst Kevin Cassidy said. In September, research firm Gartner slashed its growth forecast for the global PC market this year to 3.8 percent from 9.3 percent, citing slower economies in Western Europe and the United States.",10192011,http://www.reuters.com/article/intel/update-3-intel-shares-jump-on-upbeat-outlook-idUSL3E7LJ0ZF20111019
177,INTC,Instant view: Apple shocks investors with earns miss,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Apple Inc shocked investors with a rare miss in its quarterly earnings on Tuesday, sending its shares down sharply. Earlier, strong demand for computers in China helped chip maker Intel Corp beat Wall Street’s sales targets, while Yahoo Inc struggled to revive its online advertising business. Following is immediate reaction from investors and analysts. “The company had a solid performance but given the heightened expectations, the shortfall will certainly lead to a sell-off in shares.” “Despite the miss, we still feel Apple is the primary beneficiary of the mobility wave sweeping through the technology sector. iPads were in line with our estimates and we expect that number to ramp as we enter the holiday season.” “We would attribute the iPhone weakness to delayed purchases. We are expecting a strong holiday quarter. Typically the company is conservative but it provided an above-consensus forecast.” CHANNING SMITH, CO-MANAGER, CAPITAL ADVISORS GROWTH FUND “Obviously the numbers are a disappointment by Apple standards but investors need to take a step back. It’s fairly easy to see a weakness with the iPhone. Obviously investors are going to debate the issue. We think there were a number of consumers who were deferring their purchase until the new model came out. It’s easily explained when you see 4 million iPhones sold in 3 days.” “Investors are going to start to speculate that there is change underway now that Jobs is gone and that there’s trouble ahead. We don’t share that point. The iPhone is where the weakness was and it’s an explainable one. The strong demand for the iPhone 4S set up strong demand for the holiday season.” “The earnings miss is a bit of a surprise — they are usually fairly conservative in terms of how they provide estimates. Next quarter you will see the bump. This quarter really suffered because people are basically waiting for the new phone.” “It’s a pretty big miss. It’s a miss they haven’t had in many years. It probably just signifies the company is in transition as they are rolling out a new product. And frankly the sentiment is so positive on Apple shares, the earnings estimates have been ratcheted up pretty significantly.” “I think it’s an opportunity to buy, with the shares having fallen.” “The biggest spotlight is the growth in Asia Pacific and Japan, which grew impressively considering Japan is still recovering from the earthquake.” “Another major spotlight is the shipment of Mac computers, which was significantly above my estimate. Despite the strength of iPad, Apple is not seeing a slowdown in Mac computer sales.” “The light shipment of iPhone is understandable considering many consumers were waiting for the iPhone 4S. The decline in iPod sales is also understandable. The iPad is still going strong and is still above my estimates. If you look at the outlook, it is very bullish and above my consensus. Apple is known to lowball its guidance and that may no longer be the norm here.” “What many have not realized is that Apple will start seeling an unlocked version of the 4S in November and that can address the prepaid market, customers outside the official carriers and further penetration in international market. It was announced when iPhone 4S sales began and there could be upside.” “There’s no question this was a transition quarter ahead of the 4S (the latest iPhone). But the iPad number was a little interesting because there wasn’t a transition there.” “I wouldn’t be surprised to see people buying shares because of the holiday season. With the early pace of iPhone 4S sales, my guess is that disappointment is relatively short-lived.” “I’m not going to call Q3 a throwaway quarter for iPhones but it was definitely transition. The Mac sales were strong.” “The numbers are actually quite good. The reason why the stock is off I think some of the analysts got carried away. We have seen this before. A couple of quarters ago analysts got carried away on the iPad side. They forgot there is a product transition.” “What is interesting is the guidance is less conservative than usual for their next quarter. It’s a timing issue where it looks like the business that people thought would be in the September quarter is occurring in the December quarter. One of the things obviously is the iPhone 4S just started shipping a few days ago.” “Expectations for this company were red-hot, that is why we downgraded it. Fifty-six brokers out there and everyone is saying ‘buy’.” “The reality is their business is not an annuity. They have to sell their quarter’s worth of revenue every 90 days. They had a big upgrade cycle with the iPhone, the numbers came in weak. They need to set records every time they report to keep the momentum.” “Apple has done something very unusual. They missed estimates and they are guiding above estimates for the next quarter. This is not what they typically do. They usually exceed estimates and give out easy guidance. We will have to wait and see more on this but the Nasdaq is likely to be impacted by this tomorrow.” “A couple of things they said that were fairly constructive: they delivered a pretty clean beat and raise. They really told us that things weren’t as bad as were feared in the third quarter. Fourth quarter guidance is well above consensus estimates, but below seasonality, which makes sense.” “They are giving us a realistic look at the fourth quarter and it seems like they are guiding conservatively, between 2 and 3 percent growth. Growth is historically up about 8 percent.” “Bottom line they delivered a beat and raise. They also authorized another $10 billion in stock buyback.

182,INTC,"Thai floods, hard drive shortage threaten PC sales","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A looming shortage of hard drives caused by floods in Thailand threatens to disrupt computer manufacturers as soon as December and hurt tech giants like Intel (INTC.O), Apple (AAPL.O) and Dell DELL.O. Thailand is the No. 2 maker of hard drives, used in laptops, servers and TV set-top boxes, and damage caused by flooding across the region could keep factories closed or hobbled for months, analysts and executives say. World output of hard drives could fall as much as 30 percent in the final three months of 2011 and manufacturers that need them are now scrambling to snap up existing inventories, according to market research firm IHS iSuppli. Leading chipmaker Intel said on Friday it was keeping an eye on a “dynamic” situation but expects existing stores of drives and unaffected sources to help keep the PC industry supplied. If manufacturers build fewer PCs, Intel sells fewer processors. “The PC supply chain has proven to be very resilient, as most recently demonstrated in the response to the earthquake in Japan,” Intel spokesman Jon Carvill said. Top hard drive makers Western Digital WDC.N and Seagate (STX.O) both have factories in Thailand, where flooding has killed at least 320 people since July and devastated industrialized areas in the center of the country. Western Digital’s factories are closed and Seagate, while its plants are running, warns it could face parts shortages. Apple chief executive Steve Cook this week told analysts on a conference call he expects an industry shortage of disk drives. Intel on Tuesday said the flooding would not affect the PC market in the fourth quarter. Since then, details about the damage to Western Digital’s factories in Thailand have caused some analysts to believe a shortage of hard drives could start interfering with PC production in December. “There’s a major disconnect here. We don’t see how they can not be affected and we’re recommending investors avoid Intel at these levels,” said Brad Gastwirth, co-founder of ABR Investment Strategy, an independent research firm. Western Digital said Thailand accounts for 60 percent of drive production. Its customers have about two weeks of inventory on hand and distributors have around four weeks of supplies. As those inventories get used up, the supply of hard drives may be about 10 percent less than demand for the December quarter, estimated Rodman & Renshaw analyst Ashok Kumar. With production in Thailand likely to be constrained for several weeks, customers will face larger shortages in early 2012, IHS iSuppli analyst Fang Zhang said. No. 2 PC maker Dell said the flood would have little impact on its quarter ending this month but did not say how it expected to be impacted beyond then.

The bleak forecast sent the stock down over 8 percent in extended trading on Monday. They closed at $23.48 on Nasdaq. “In the fourth quarter we expect our notebook business to be down as customers have indicated businesses are tightening the belt and are waiting for better visibility from a macro economic standpoint,” Volterra CEO Jeff Staszak said on a call with analysts. Texas Instruments on Monday warned that fourth-quarter results could decline as a result of weaker-than-usual holiday season demand because of macroeconomic weakness. Volterra, which makes low-voltage power supply chips, forecast fourth-quarter earnings of 22-27 cents a share on revenue of $37-$39 million. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 35 cents a share on revenue of $44.4 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Volterra, which also competes with International Rectifier Corp , Intersil Corp and Linear Technology Corp  , also posted disappointing third-quarter revenue hurt by a delay in the launch of Intel Corp’s new Romley server platform. Intel’s Romley server platform is now slated to be introduced in the first quarter 2012. It had earlier planned to launch the platform in the fourth-quarter this year. “Server sales were probably weaker than expected as customers delayed orders until the new Intel Romley platform became available,” Longbow Research analyst Joanne Feeney said. Revenue for July-September was nearly flat at $41.3 million, missing market estimates of $43.14 million. Excluding one-offs, the company, whose customers include International Business Machines Corp and Hewlett-Packard Co , earned 35 cents a share, topping analysts expectations of 32 cents a share.",10242011,http://www.reuters.com/article/volterrasemiconductor/update-2-volterra-gives-bleak-outlook-on-soft-server-demand-idUSL3E7LO2OT20111024
185,INTC,HP launches plan to build low-power servers,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Hewlett Packard Co unveiled plans to develop extremely low-energy servers, partnering with companies such as chip designers ARM Holdings Plc and Advanced Micro Devices Inc in a move that could threaten the dominance of Intel Corp. Explosive growth in data centers that drive the Internet is taking up increasing amounts of electricity and tech companies are looking for ways to make servers more efficient and trim their energy bills. HP, at an event at its research center in Palo Alto, said the effort, dubbed “Project Moonshot,” aimed to find an alternative to the massive computing infrastructure needed to support the Web and billions of mobile devices. The Silicon Valley giant is working with Austin-based start-up chipmaker Calxeda — which uses the ARM technology in its microprocessors — to create servers aimed at companies running large-scale remote computing operations such as Twitter and Facebook. ARM is an investor in Calxeda. The new servers will significantly reduce both power and space requirements, Paul Santeler, vice president of HP’s Hyperscale business within its server division said. HP’s first Calxeda-based pilot server platforms will be available in the first half of next year, Santeler said, but did not reveal when HP expects to sell the production version. Energy-efficient chips made using ARM technology are widely used in tablets and smartphones and ARM executives have said they want to make them popular for personal computers and corporate servers too. British chip designer ARM last week unveiled its first 64-bit architecture, which it said would expand its reach into enterprise applications such as servers currently dominated by Intel. As well as chip designers, HP’s program will include storage, networking and software companies. Along with Calxeda, HP is also developing other servers using Intel’s Atom processor. Intel’s chips are used in 80 percent of the world’s personal computers and servers and, while they are more powerful than ARM-based chips, they also use much more electricity. Santa Clara, California-based Intel is rushing to use its lead in high-tech manufacturing to make its processors more energy efficient. Nvidia Corp, another semiconductor company, said in January it was developing processors for PCs, servers and supercomputers based on ARM’s architecture under the title “Project Denver.” ",11012011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-hp-servers/hp-launches-plan-to-build-low-power-servers-idUSTRE7A06AA20111101
186,INTC,UPDATE 2-AMD to lay off a 10th of workforce by 2012,"* Job cuts to save $200 million * Move follows problems manufacturing new chips * Savings to be invested in cloud, low-power chips Nov 3 (Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices Inc  unveiled a plan on Thursday to save about $200 million of operating costs in 2012 by slashing 10 percent of its global workforce and streamlining internal business processes. The layoffs mark the first major move by Chief Executive Rory Read, who came onboard in August to try to galvanize a microprocessor maker that has bled market share to larger rival Intel Corp , while missing out on the mobile device boom. “It’s not too surprising given the operating background of the new CEO and this is exactly what you’d bring an outsider in to do, but their problems go far deeper right now,” said Alex Gauna, an analyst at JMP Securities. The layoffs should be completed in 2012’s first quarter, AMD said in a statement. Savings generated could help bankroll research and expansion into areas such as low-power chips, emerging markets and cloud computing next year. In late September AMD, a distant second to Intel in selling microprocessors that are the brains of PCs, warned of manufacturing problems manufacturing it new 32 nanometer Llano chips as well as older 45 nanometer chips. Last week Read said AMD and its manufacturing partner GlobalFoundries were making progress but that more work was needed to improve AMD’s execution. Like Intel, AMD has failed to gain traction in increasingly popular mobile gadgets like Google Inc’s Android smartphones and Apple Inc’s iPad, which some people are buying instead of laptops. Read, who was a top executive with PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd , replaced Dirk Meyer, who left in January partly due to differences with the board of directors over the company’s mobile strategy.

189,INTC,"HP, Intel plotted to keep Itanium processor alive: Oracle","(Reuters) - Oracle Corp accused Hewlett-Packard C of “secretly” contracting with Intel Corp to keep Intel’s Itanium microprocessor from being phased out, according to a court filing from Oracle in its long-running legal battle with HP over the Itanium platform. According to Oracle’s filing, HP and Intel forged a “contractual commitment” to keep Itanium going through the next two generations of microprocessors, despite HP’s previous statements that Intel’s decision to keep investing in Itanium was its own. “HP has secretly contracted with Intel to keep churning out Itaniums so that HP can maintain the appearance that a dead microprocessor is alive,” Oracle wrote. “The whole thing is a remake of Weekend at Bernie’s.” HP spokesman Michael Thacker called the filing “nothing more than a desperate delay tactic designed to extend the paralyzing uncertainty in the marketplace created when Oracle announced in March 2011 - in clear break of contract - that it would no longer support HP’s Itanium platform.” Intel declined to comment. It’s the latest salvo in a bitter lawsuit and countersuit between the two companies. In March, Oracle decided to discontinue its support for Itanium, a heavy-duty computing microprocessor, saying that Intel made it clear that the chip was nearing the end of its life and that Intel was shifting its focus to its x86 microprocessor. HP called Oracle’s decision “anti-customer,” and sued Oracle in California state court in June. In August, Oracle hit back with a countersuit against HP, accusing the company of concealing facts during its negotiation over the Itanium platform.

191,INTC,HP prods EU antitrust authorities against Oracle,"SAN JOSE, California (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard is trying to enlist European antitrust authorities to investigate whether Oracle improperly leveraged its strength in software to freeze HP out of certain parts of the hardware market, attorneys for both companies said in court. The disclosure came on Tuesday in a state court hearing in San Jose, California, the latest in a bitter dispute between the companies over Oracle’s decision to cease supporting Intel Corp’s Itanium microprocessor. “They are going literally around the world to every antitrust jurisdiction, trying to say we’re trying to put them out of business,” Oracle attorney Daniel Wall said of HP. HP attorney Robert Cooper said the European issues are separate from its U.S. lawsuit. “They turn on whether Oracle is abusing its position of power on software to drive us out of the hardware business,” Cooper said. The status of any potential European inquiry is unclear. “HP is pursuing all avenues to enforce Oracle’s commitments to HP and our shared customers,” HP spokesman Michael Thacker said on Tuesday. An Oracle spokeswoman declined to comment. Oracle decided in March to discontinue its support for Itanium, a heavy-duty computing microprocessor, saying Intel made it clear the chip was nearing the end of its life and the company’s focus was on its x86 microprocessor. HP has dubbed Oracle’s decision “anti-customer” behavior, saying in court papers that it was part of a bid to force HP customers to purchase servers from Sun Microsystems, which had been bought by Oracle. HP sued Oracle in a California state court in June. Oracle, meanwhile, has accused HP of fraud on the market, saying the only reason Intel continues to invest in Itanium is because HP secretly contracted with Intel to do so. An Intel spokesman declined to comment on the case. The litigation has been part of a deteriorating relationship between the two companies. Also on Tuesday, the Delaware Supreme Court ruled that HP did not have to turn over an internal report that led to the departure of former chief executive Mark Hurd last year. Hurd joined Oracle as president soon after. In court on Tuesday, Santa Clara Superior Court Judge James Kleinberg pressed each side to enter settlement discussions. Kleinberg noted the recent management changes at HP, with Meg Whitman taking over as chief executive after former CEO Leo Apotheker’s exit. Apotheker had a toxic relationship with Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, and it was under Apotheker’s leadership that HP sued Oracle over the Itanium decision. “My global question is, what does each side want at the end of the day out of this case?” Kleinberg asked. But attorneys for both sides expressed pessimism about settlement. Oracle attorney Wall said Oracle had strong counterclaims against HP for alleged fraud on the market surrounding Itanium. “We are going to take that case to trial,” Wall said. HP’s Cooper reiterated that support for Itanium is “mission critical” to the company. Itanium is a “very important product to HP,” Cooper said. Kleinberg set a trial date of April 2, 2012, but still ordered each side to exchange names of potential settlement mediators.

192,INTC,"Intel, Total Immersion working on augmented reality chipsets","(Reuters) - Total Immersion, a pioneer in emerging field of augmented reality (AR), is working with Intel to bring AR features, like gesture recognition, into Intel’s chipsets, an executive of the privately held firm said on Wednesday. Speaking at the Reuters Global Media Summit, Total Immersion’s marketing chief Antoine Brachet said consumer acceptance will decide when products would reach the market, but he thinks this could happen in 2-3 years. Running on smartphones or computers, AR overlays digital information - text, graphics, games — on images of the world around us. Intel, whose processors are used in 80 percent of the world’s personal computers, took a stake in Total Immersion in March when its investment arm led the $5.5 million funding round in the firm. “What we are doing together with Intel is working on their chipset ... so inside the chipset you can have some AR features, like gesture recognition that can be transferred from software to hardware,” Brachet said. Moving the feature into hardware will make it faster to use for consumers and could boost takeup of the new technology among consumers as it would be in all devices, without the need for additional downloads. The 1999-founded Total Immersion is one of the largest players in the emerging augmented reality industry which has lately attracted technology sector heavyweights like Google, Intel and Qualcomm. “Those guys understand the fact that something is going to happen and they want to take a potential position in that,” Brachet said.

196,INTC,Intel says sales hit by hard drive shortage,"(Reuters) - Intel Corp warned that hard-disk drive supply shortages would hurt its current-quarter revenue, the latest heavyweight in the PC industry to caution about the effects of flooding that has crippled factories in Thailand. The warning sent shares of the world’s top chipmaker down 4.8 percent and weighed on Wall Street. Hundreds of people have died in flooding in Thailand that has caused billions of dollars in damages since late July and disrupted international supply chains in the PC and automobile industries. PC makers have been scrambling to buy increasingly scarce hard drives after the flooding shut down factories in the country, which is the world’s No 2 exporter of the components. “In the last two weeks, as the supply became more apparent, we saw a substantial change in our order rate. Most of our customers are concerned the shortage will continue — especially through the early part of the first quarter,” Intel Senior Vice President Tom Kilroy told analysts on a conference call. Major PC makers including Hewlett Packard, Dell, Lenovo and Acer since October have warned to varying degrees that they may build fewer PCs as they use up the current stock of hard drives and struggle to replace them. Intel said its customers are reducing their stock of chips in anticipation of the hard drive shortage continuing early next year, although it said it still expects sales of PCs to be up in the fourth quarter. “This is Intel coming to terms with it,” said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy. “I think Intel sees a lag effect as inventory gets worked down. Then they’ll see an accelerated effect as inventories rebuild.” Cassidy and other analysts pointed to graphics chipmaker Nvidia as among the only big players in the PC supply chain that have not warned investors about the effects of the drive shortage. Its shares were down 3 percent at $14.45. Damage caused by the floods is expected to shrink global hard drive output by about a third in the current quarter. Western Digital, the hard drive manufacturer hit hardest by the floods, this month resumed production and warned of tight global supplies into next year. California-based Western Digital, which vies with Seagate Technology for the title of the world’s largest maker of hard drives, expects a world shortage of 60 million hard drives in the December quarter. Seagate’s Thai plants have been largely unaffected by the catastrophe, but production has been curtailed due to tight component supplies as factories of some key suppliers were flooded. Intel Chief Financial Officer told investors on the call that he expects the shortage to accelerate the adoption of solid-state drives as the main storage devices in PCs. Made with NAND semiconductors, solid-state drives are much faster than hard drives but are also a lot more expensive and are currently used only in high-end PCs like Apple’s MacBook Air. Intel said quarterly revenue is now seen at $13.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million, below a previous forecast of $14.7 billion. Analysts’ average forecast is $14.65 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Intel said non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be around 65.5 percent versus previous expectations of 66 percent.

198,INTC,Intel combines divisions in bid to boost mobile,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel is combining four divisions under a new mobile and communications unit in a bid to catch up in smartphones and tablets, where it has so far failed to gain traction. The new division combines Intel’s netbook and tablets division, its ultra mobility division, the mobile communications division and the mobile wireless division, spokesman Robert Manetta told Reuters. “The ultimate goal is we want to speed up and improve the development process,” he said. Intel’s processors power 80 percent of the world’s PCs but the Santa Clara, California company so far has failed in the fast-growing smartphone and tablet market. The new division will be headed by Mike Bell, who moved to Intel last year after playing a hand in the development of the iPhone at Apple, and by former Infineon executive Hermann Eul. Eul had headed Intel’s mobile communications division, which included the cellphone technology business it bought from Infineon in January. Intel’s mobile wireless group is responsible for short-range networking like WiFi and the ultra mobility group has developed smartphone processors. Intel has been adapting its PC chip architecture to be more suitable for mobile gadgets but it faces tough competition from rivals like Qualcomm and Texas Instruments. They specialize in energy efficient chips — a big factor for devices that rally on batteries — using technology licensed from Britain’s ARM Holdings. Manufacturers are expected to unveil smartphones using a new Intel mobile chip, codenamed Medfield, early next year.

199,INTC,Intel's smartphone guru angles for smooth landing,"SANTA CLARA, California (Reuters) - Mike Bell likens his new job at Intel Corp to piloting a glider. The engineer Intel is counting on to spearhead a belated drive into the smartphone arena has refocused its development arm, brought in new blood, and tried to inculcate an appreciation for gadgetry at the decades-old institution. Now, with Intel at a critical juncture as it prepares to trot out the first smartphones powered by its chips in coming months, Bell has to ensure a smooth touchdown. Failure is not an option for the ex-Apple Inc veteran who flies motorless aircraft in his spare time. “In a glider, you don’t ‘try’ to land. When you make a decision to land, you’re going to land,” the 44-year-old Bell told Reuters this week. “Some landings are better than others, but you practice over time, and you get better and better.” Many on Wall Street deem Intel at a crossroads, where it either has to carve out a share of the mobile market alongside agile rivals like ARM and Samsung Electronics — or risk becoming irrelevant in the long run. The world’s largest chipmaker is winging its way deep into unfamiliar territory. After decades at the bleeding edge of PC technology, Intel finds itself left behind in a headlong race to design the brains of a new crop of tablets and smartphones. Bell, a mechanical engineering major whose resume includes a stint at Palm, hopes to reverse that. Within Intel, he is known as a “phone guy” with a good understanding of chips, rather than a “chip guy” trying to figure out phones. Underscoring the urgency of his brief, Chief Executive Paul Otellini has given Bell carte blanche to draw on Intel’s assets. Bell has used that to rope experts from different departments into an autonomous group focused on integrating software like Android with Intel’s chip designs. Intel for now is keeping most of its advances close to the vest. But in a field where power-efficiency ranks about as high as computing velocity, Bell believes Intel’s newest chip, the Medfield, is just about ready for prime time. “Medfield is our first real foray into the space. We have no apologies to make in power or performance. It’s a fantastic first step for us,” the shaggy-haired executive said. Worldwide smartphone processor sales came to $2.24 billion (1.43 billion pounds) in the third quarter, according to market research firm Strategy Analytics. That’s a pittance compared with Intel’s $14.7 billion in revenue in the same quarter. But smartphone sales are expected to grow 32 percent next year, according to IHS iSuppli, while some experts see marginal PC microprocessor demand growth at best. With the tablet and smartphone market booming — partly at the expense of personal computers — investors worry that the chipmaker’s setback in mobile could leave it badly positioned for future waves of mobile devices. Intel’s shares trade at around $24 — about in line with pre-recession levels below $30. 2012 will provide the acid test for Intel’s mobile offerings. Otellini said in November “a number” of manufacturers are using the Medfield in Google Android smartphones hitting the market in the first half of next year. Some experts believe Intel’s proprietary architecture is ill-suited for mobile processors. Apple and other manufacturers rely on technology licensed by Britain’s ARM Holdings. But Bell, who left Palm to join Intel more than a year ago, believes Medfield can hold its own against rival chips offered by the likes of Qualcomm Inc and Nvidia. With processors also made by Texas Instruments Inc and Samsung stealing the show, his engineers have been laboring to adapt technology refined over decades for PCs to work better in handheld devices without quickly draining their batteries. “Based on our own internal research, we think Medfield is going to be very competitive in the time frame that it ships against anything in the market,” he argued. Bell has brought in talent from outside to propel his effort, including engineers from Apple and other smartphone makers. And he has leveraged an internal R&D; machine that the chipmaker poured almost $7 billion into last year. Intel will manufacture Medfield using a 32-nanometer process, which packs more transistors into the same space than rival chips made on wider line-width processes. It plans next year to shrink the process down to 22 nanometers. “We already have the next three generations on the drawing board and in process,” Bell said. His rapid ascent at Intel came at a time of turbulence. He began in July 2010 as a vice president in charge merely of building reference devices to show off chips to customers. Salesmen at the time wielded a brick-like device that could perform basic features — but sorely lacked panache. To help his team and customers envision the experience, he designed a whole new Android smartphone, distributed to potential clients and internally to a thousand employees. Their feedback helped inform development. In March, Bell and Dave Whalen took over the Ultra Mobility division after Intel veteran Anand Chandrasekher, who led Intel’s charge into netbooks, resigned. Some investors took his departure as a sign the company was struggling with its smartphone strategy. Then a week ago, Intel consolidated four divisions into a mobile and communications unit led by Bell and ex-Infineon executive Hermann Eul. Both are general managers of the group, but Bell heads up processor development while Eul oversees connectivity chips including modems, Bluetooth and WiFi. At Palm, Bell had led a team that created the Pre and Pixi. But he became one of many to jump ship after the struggling company was acquired by Hewlett Packard Co last year. Before that, he spent 16 years at Apple, where he had a hand in developing the iMac, iPhone and Apple TV. One industry insider who had worked with him said Bell’s ace card is his ability to understand how to design and build phones and bring them to market. He sees how different parts work together, like software and hardware, instead of concentrating on chips. “If you really want to be effective at what you do these days, it’s hard in isolation to be good at just one piece. So much of being able to create a system is understanding the entire flow,” Bell said. “That’s what makes the difference between a really great product and something that you say, ‘Hmm, this isn’t really well-put-together.’” Bell, a partner in a Napa Valley winery who toyed with the idea of starting his own vineyard after HP bought Palm, now relishes the chance to lead Intel into battle. “Projections in the smartphone space far outpace the growth of PCs. How can I not want to be involved in that? “The wine business can wait.” ",12232011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-intel-smartphones/intels-smartphone-guru-angles-for-smooth-landing-idUSTRE7BM19A20111223
200,INTC,"Barclays upgrade Micron, shares jump","(Reuters) - Shares of Micron Technology Inc climbed as much as 11 percent after Barclays Capital raised the chip devices maker’s stock to “overweight,” even as the brokerage downgraded five other stocks from the sector, including Intel Corp. Barclays said it expects Micron to benefit from higher pricing of Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) and stronger PC sales, likely from the second half of the year. Shares of the company, which was valued at $6.2 billion, were trading up 9 percent at $6.88 around midday on Nasdaq after touching a high of $6.96 in morning trade. Barclays lowered its ratings on Intel, Applied Materials Inc, Freescale Semiconductor Holdings Ltd, Microchip Technology Inc and Spansion Inc to “equal weight” from “overweight.” The brokerage, however, left its rating for the U.S. semiconductor capital equipment sector unchanged at “neutral.” Barclays also retained its “positive” rating on the U.S. semiconductor sector, and said it expects semiconductor stocks to outperform end markets in the second half of 2012 and to grow at 6 to 8 percent in 2013. “First quarter should be the trough for semis given the ongoing inventory correction, coupled with supply chain constraints, due to muted end demand visibility,” Barclays analyst C.J. Muse wrote in a note to clients. Muse now expects U.S. semiconductor revenue growth to come in flat to 4 percent in 2012. He had earlier forecast growth of 2 to 5 percent. According to Thomson Reuters’ Starmine data, Muse is a four star-rated analyst for the accuracy of his earnings estimates on the companies under his coverage universe, which include Intel and Applied Materials. The Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 12 percent since the start of 2011 to end the year at 364.44 points, as the industry was hit by disruptions in supply chains with the earthquake and tsunami in Japan and flooding in Thailand.

201,INTC,"Motorola, Lenovo sign on to first Intel-powered smartphones","(Reuters) - Intel announced multi-year pacts with Motorola Mobility and Lenovo to develop smartphones and tablets, and said the first Google Android phones using the top chipmaker’s processors would go on sale this year. Speaking at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Tuesday, Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini said Lenovo would launch a smartphone for the Chinese market using Intel’s newest chip in the second quarter of the year, while Motorola will release its phone in the second half. The agreements with the U.S. and Chinese consumer electronics makers help shore up Intel’s boldest foray into the mobile arena. The company is hoping its new “Medfield” chip conserves enough power to compete with rival smartphones using ARM Holdings’ more energy-efficient architecture. The world’s largest chip maker is also making a concerted push for the likes of Hewlett Packard to go big on super-slim, Apple Macbook Air-like laptops called Ultrabooks, which it hopes will preserve its dominance of the PC market as tablets like the iPad draw consumers away. “It is a multi-year, multi-product strategy that will bring both phones and tablets to the (U.S.) marketplace starting with a phone in the second half of 2012,” Dave Whalen, a vice president in the Intel Architecture Group, said of the agreement with Motorola. “You’re going to see us working very closely with them on technologies,” Whalen told Reuters in an interview. With mobile processors made by the likes of Texas Instruments Inc and Samsung stealing the show, Intel’s engineers have been laboring to adapt technology refined over decades for PCs to work better in handheld devices without quickly draining their batteries. With its chips so far seen as to power hungry for handheld devices, Intel has found itself left behind in a headlong race to design the brains of tablets and smartphones. Intel says Medfield ranks well in benchmark tests against competing chips on the market. An ongoing relationship to build smartphones with Motorola could position Intel well in the fast-growing market, even if Motorola continues to make phones using other companies’ processors. Motorola Mobility has agreed to be bought by Google, which owns the Android platform widely used on smartphones and tablets competing with Apple. “We’re going to work very closely with Motorola and Google and really figure out what kind of things we can do that are unique and different,” Whalen said, mentioning camera and video technology as examples. The Lenovo agreement builds on an existing partnership between the two companies focused on personal computers. Lenovo, the world’s No. 2 PC maker, has focused its strategy on its home market but on Tuesday, it said it would sell a smartphone for U.S. consumers in time. Many on Wall Street deem Intel at a crossroads, where it either has to carve out a share of the mobile market or risk becoming irrelevant in the long run. The Santa Clara, California company has made previous attempts at processors for smartphones and tablets that fell short of expectations and were passed over by manufacturers. Many Wall Street investors have since taken a “wait and see” attitude toward Intel’s efforts in mobile. With the tablet and smartphone market booming — partly at the expense of personal computers — investors worry that the chipmaker’s setback in mobile could leave it badly positioned for future waves of mobile devices.

204,INTC,It's earnings versus Europe for stocks,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock investors will return to a tug of war between signs of domestic strength and overseas concerns next week as a batch of critical earnings reports look to add credence to the idea the economy is improving, while credit rating downgrades in Europe will keep that region’s difficulties in view. Bank stocks will probably once again be a primary focus, as not only will European issues call the group’s profit outlook into question, but many key names report results. Equities have recently undergone a decoupling with respect to Europe’s sovereign debt crisis as signs of progress in the euro zone, along with improving U.S. data, have pushed Wall Street higher on improved growth prospects. Financials have been a beneficiary of that rising tide, with Bank of America up 22 percent since the start of the year. So far this month, the S&P; 500 .SPX is up 2.5 percent, while the Dow .DJI is up 1.7 percent and the Nasdaq is up 4.1 percent. “We’re going to see more volatility in the weeks ahead with tension between earnings and Europe,” said Christopher Sheldon, the Boston-based director of investment strategy at BNY Mellon Wealth Management, which oversees $171 billion globally. “We want to see Europe resolved, but there will continue to be ups and downs, and while earnings will continue to be relatively good, we do expect slowing compared with 2011.” However, the uncertainty about Europe returned in a big way on Friday after Standard & Poor’s downgraded the ratings of several euro-zone countries, including Italy, after the market closed. Talk of the downgrades spurred a selloff that erased most of the gains for the week, when the S&P; rose for four straight sessions. A downgrade could exacerbate the area’s difficulties and bring concerns about how they might affect U.S. banks profits back to the forefront. Still, market participants looking for signs of strength don’t have to look far. Data has been bullish lately, including Friday’s consumer sentiment reading at an eight-month high that sharply exceeded what was anticipated. “The prospect of a downgrade has been around for a while, so despite today’s reaction, everyone was aware of the potential, and I don’t think it will be as impactful, especially as corporate business trends remain strong,” said Hank Herrmann, chief executive of Waddell & Reed Financial Inc in Overland Park, Kansas. Earnings reports from numerous bellwethers could reinforce the growth story. Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), General Electric Co (GE.N), Intel Corp (INTC.O), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) are among the names set to report. Early reads have supported the idea that better times lie ahead. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) said the domestic economy was strengthening even as its profit fell 23 percent, while Alcoa Inc (AA.N) rallied earlier in the week after giving a bullish outlook for the aluminum sector. “Banks will be an important part of the story, especially with Europe in the picture, and investors will also be looking at names like GE, which have global exposure, to see what insights can be gleaned from that,” said Herrman, who helps oversee $90 billion in assets. Next week, when markets will be closed on Monday because of the Martin Luther King holiday, will also see the release of the New York Fed’s January manufacturing data, December readings on inflation from both the Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price Index, as well as December housing starts.

206,INTC,UPDATE 1-Samsung seeks to merge smartphone operating platforms,"* Aims to merge own bada platform with Tizen * Both platforms based on Linux operating system * Tizen development led by Intel and Samsung By Miyoung Kim and Tarmo Virki SEOUL/HELSINKI, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co plans to merge its own ‘bada’ mobile phone operating software with an open-source Tizen platform as the world’s biggest smartphone maker seeks alternatives to Google’s  Android in its devices. The new platform will have to go further than Nokia  and Palm which have both failed with developers and device makers in the last year or so as the market became increasingly consolidated by Google and Apple. A Samsung spokesman said the company was working on merging bada and Tizen, confirming comments from senior vice president Kang Tae-jin in a Forbes magazine interview last week. “With a strong leadership from a major vendor such as Samsung, I think the OS may have a chance, as most vendors based on Android now are looking for an alternative to Google’s dependency,” said IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo. Support by many handset manufacturers resulted in a more than 50 percent market share for Android, which then faded after Google unveiled its $12.5 billion offer for phone maker Motorola Mobility last year. Samsung, which emerged as the No 1 smartphone manufacturer on the back of booming demand for Android models in the third quarter, joined forces with Intel last year to strengthen its mobile software push. TIZEN-BADA In September two Linux software groups, one backed by Samsung and another by Intel, agreed to jointly develop Tizen, a new operating system for smartphones and other devices, by merging their LiMo and Meego platforms in a bid to gain wider industry and consumer support. The open-source Tizen platform could be used for devices like smartphones, tablets, Internet-enabled TVs, netbooks and in-vehicle infotainment systems. Tizen is still in development, with its predecessor MeeGo used in a few devices, including Nokia’s N9 smartphone. Samsung’s dominant role could also help to quickly kick-start the new platform, but runs the risk of failing if it does not offer other manufacturers the opportunity to have their input. “This is a logical step but it’s strategic importance to Samsung is likely to discourage others contemplating Tizen as an Android alternative,” said Geoff Blaber, analyst at British wireless research firm CCS Insight. Google’s Android accounted for 53 percent of the global smartphone market in the third quarter and Samsung’s bada platform just 2.2 percent, still ahead of Microsoft’s  Windows Phone, which Nokia picked as its sole future platform. Earlier on Tuesday, parent Samsung Group, South Korea’s largest business group, said it was raising its 2012 investment to a record $41.4 billion as it banks on logic chips and OLED displays to repeat its success in flash chips, computer memory chips and LCD flat-screens.",1172012,http://www.reuters.com/article/samsung-tizen/update-1-samsung-seeks-to-merge-smartphone-operating-platforms-idUSL3E8CH2K720120117

208,INTC,McAfee rejects Symantec claim about market share,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Security software maker McAfee rejected a claim that several large corporate customers had recently switched over to using products from rival Symantec Corp. Symantec Chief Financial Officer James Beer told Reuters in an interview late on Wednesday that his company was taking share in the anti-virus software market away from McAfee, which was purchased by chipmaker Intel Corp in February. Beer said that several large McAfee customers had switched to Symantec during the quarter, but declined to identify them. McAfee Senior Vice President for Finance and Accounting Edward Hayden told Reuters on Thursday that the claim was false. He added that his company had booked a record amount of business in its December quarter, signed its biggest deal ever and closed more sales over $1 million than it had in any single period. “We are not aware of any major account that we lost to Symantec during the quarter,” he said. Intel bought McAfee in a $7.7 billion deal meant to spur growth at the world’s top chipmaker and also help it better protect its products from hackers. Investors are still waiting to see whether that bet will yield results. McAfee laid off about 3 percent of its workers, or about 250 employees, in December. Hayden said that the company is now adding staff in priority areas including mobile technology, cloud computing and network security.

211,INTC,Intel CFO faces fewer worried investors,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith likes the questions he is receiving from Wall Street these days a lot more than the concerns many investors voiced last year about the PC chip giant’s ability to adapt to consumers’ growing preference for smartphones and tablets. After investors eyeing tepid PC sales shunned Intel’s shares for much of 2011, the stock has rebounded since September and recently hit a four-year high as the company promotes a new category of premium notebooks and shows off a mobile processor that may finally put it in the mobile race. Smith told Reuters his conversations with investors have become easier in the past few months. “A year ago, the concerns were that the drivers of the market weren’t going to let Intel grow and that there was something inherent in our architecture that precluded us from being able to participate in fast growing parts of the market,” Smith said in an interview on Wednesday. “Fast forward a year and we’ve alleviated both of those concerns.” Intel’s processors are the brains in 80 percent of the world’s personal computers, but the company has had a hard time adapting its powerful “x86” architecture to make low-powered chips for mobile devices that depend on batteries. With PC sales flagging in the United States and Europe, nearly all smartphones and tablets, including Apple’s iPhones and iPads, use energy-efficient processors based on a competing technology licensed to chip designers by Britain’s ARM Holdings and made by Intel rivals like Samsung and Qualcomm. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last month, Intel impressed technophiles with demonstrations of its new Medfield mobile chip and said Motorola Mobility and Lenovo have picked it for upcoming smartphones. Smith said investors are now asking about new products like Medfield as well as Intel’s growing budgets for R&D; and new factories to extend its lead in manufacturing. On a conference call with analysts following Intel’s quarterly report in January, he reassured investors that the company’s record $12.5 billion capital spending planned for 2012 would not become permanent and would come down in the future. Intel’s new mobile chip is made using Intel’s 32 nanometer manufacturing technology, and new generations of the chip manufactured at even smaller sizes in 2012 and 2013 will be even more energy efficient, Intel says. “We’re cleanly in the game. We’re among the best today with the current generation and it will extend out over time,” Smith said. Intel refocused its push into mobile on Google’s popular Android platform last year after cellphone maker Nokia backed away from a platform it had been working on with Intel. Analysts see Lenovo and Motorola’s decision to build phones using Medfield as a good start for Intel, but many remain cautious and are waiting to see how many Intel-powered phones are bought by consumers. Smith said Intel would eventually look to sell its chips for phones running competing platforms. “When you look at the phone market, there’s the Apple camp, the Google camp, the Microsoft camp. We will work hard to win designs across all those segments of the market.” Weak economies in the United States and Europe, as well as a growing preference for tablets, have hurt PC sales, and Intel is increasingly dependent on emerging markets like China to fuel growth. Eager to make laptops more attractive to consumers captivated by Apple’s iPad, MacBook Air and other mobile gadgets, Intel is pushing PC makers to concentrate on a new “Ultrabook” category of super-thin PCs boasting features from tablets like touch screens and “instant on” responsiveness. Some analysts question whether the high-end features Intel says Ultrabooks should include might make them too expensive for many consumers. Smith said he expects Ultrabooks prices to decline quickly. “As we drive scale, costs will come down,” Smith said. “We fully expect we’ll exit 2012 right in the heart of mainstream notebook price points with these very sexy Ultrabooks, because we’ll be shipping tens of millions of them.” ",2022012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-intel-cfo/intel-cfo-faces-fewer-worried-investors-idUSTRE81114K20120202

213,INTC,Intel settles NY antitrust case for just $6.5 million,"(Reuters) - Intel Corp agreed to pay just $6.5 million to resolve an antitrust lawsuit in which New York’s attorney general accused the world’s largest chipmaker of threatening computer makers and paying billions of dollars of kickbacks to maintain its market dominance. The settlement ends a November 2009 Delaware case brought by Andrew Cuomo, then New York’s attorney general and now governor. Eric Schneiderman, the current attorney general, took over the case when he succeeded Cuomo in that position. Intel’s $6.5 million payment represents less than five hours of profit for the Santa Clara, California-based company, based on reported net income of $12.94 billion for 2011. Cuomo had accused Intel of violating state and federal antitrust law through a “systematic worldwide campaign” to bully customers into buying its personal computer chips, at the expense of rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. But the lawsuit lost much of its punch when U.S. District Judge Leonard Stark said the state could not seek triple damages, and was allowed to pursue claims over just three years of computer purchases, not four or six as it had sought. Jennifer Givner, a spokeswoman for Schneiderman, said the state’s lawyers still believe their substantive claims have merit, but that “in light of the court’s decision believe that no purpose is served by pursuing the matter further.” Intel said it was pleased to settle, and that the accord did not require it to admit to any allegations or violation of law, or make any changes to its business. “We have always said that Intel’s business practices are lawful, pro-competitive and beneficial to consumers,” General Counsel Doug Melamed said in a statement. Cuomo had contended that Intel bribed or coerced computer makers such as Dell Inc, Hewlett-Packard Co and International Business Machines Corp, and threatened retaliation. Emails showed that top Intel officers including Chief Executive Paul Otellini were aware of some of the improper activity, Cuomo alleged. Intel has long faced allegations of anticompetitive conduct, and is still appealing a 1.06 billion euro (now US$1.41 billion) fine imposed in 2009 by European regulators. In 2010, the Federal Trade Commission settled a case in which it accused Intel of unlawfully stifling competition in microprocessors. The same year, a different Delaware federal judge approved a settlement with shareholders that called for Intel to make more than 40 corporate governance changes, including the creation of a compliance committee to monitor antitrust litigation.

216,INTC,"Jobs, factory data strengthen growth outlook","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for new unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell to a near four-year low last week, suggesting the labor market recovery was quickening. Other data on Thursday showing solid expansion in factory activity in the Mid-Atlantic area this month and builders breaking more ground on new residential projects in January offered more evidence of a sustained momentum in the economy. “The numbers add to the belief that the economy is shifting gears. There is just no number that is giving us a whole lot of trouble, except for consumer spending,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. The reports are the latest in a series of fairly upbeat data and could prompt economists to further temper expectations of a sharp moderation in growth in the first quarter. Economists have also dialed down their expectations for another round of bond-buying or quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 348,000, the lowest level since March 2008, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 365,000. The four-week average of new claims, seen as a better measure of labor market trends, was the lowest since April 2008. In a separate report, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business activity index rose to 10.2 this month from 7.3 in January as orders and shipments jumped. Though factories in the region covering eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware hired fewer workers this month, they increased hours for existing employees, which bodes well for wage growth. In addition, order backlogs are rising and factories are taking a bit longer to make deliveries. “We are not seeing much indication that growth has slowed from the fourth quarter of 2011 to the first quarter of 2012,” said Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The economy grew at a 2.8 percent annual pace in the last three months of 2011, with inventories accounting for two-thirds of the rise. That left economists worrying businesses will have little appetite to add more stocks with demand not that strong. For now, the run of solid data continues. The Commerce Department reported that housing starts rose 1.5 percent to an annual rate of 699,000 units last month, beating economists’ expectations for a 675,000-unit pace. Starts were boosted by multi-unit buildings, reflecting growing demand for rental apartments as Americans move away from homeownership. Permits for future home construction rose 0.7 percent to a 676,000-unit pace in January. Home building is expected to add to economic growth this year for the first time since 2005. The data and rising hopes for a deal on a second bailout package for Greece buoyed U.S. stocks, with the broader Standard & Poor’s 500 index touching a nine-month high. U.S. Treasury debt prices fell and the dollar rallied against the yen. The data on employment, manufacturing and retail sales have also raised doubts on whether the U.S. central bank will keep its pledge to hold interest rates at ultra-low levels until at least through 2014. The Fed made its low rate commitment before January’s employment report was released. Minutes of the Fed’s January 24-25 meeting released on Wednesday showed a few policymakers believed a third round of quantitative easing would be needed this year to support the U.S. economy. “Fed policy looks more and more at odds with a brightening economic outlook,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in New York. “Our guess is they start normalizing their low interest rate policy sometime early next year if the data keep running like this. The economy really doesn’t seem to require it at this stage.” But rising oil prices as tensions mount over Iran’s nuclear program pose a major risk to the economy’s increasingly upbeat outlook. Brent crude rose on Thursday for a fourth day in a row, topping a six-month high of $120 a barrel. Last week’s drop in new unemployment claims pushed them below the 350,000 level that economists normally associate with sustained strength in the labor market. Claims have declined for three straight weeks. Job gains have exceeded 200,000 for two straight months and the unemployment rate dropped to a three-year low of 8.3 percent in January. Economists are cautiously optimistic that February will be another month of solid job gains. Despite the improvement, considerable slack still remains. About 23.8 million Americans are either out of work or underemployed and there are no job openings for nearly three out of every four unemployed. In a second report, the Labor Department said prices received by farms, factories and refineries edged up just 0.1 percent in January as food and energy costs fell. Wholesale prices dipped 0.1 percent in December. But producer prices excluding food and energy rose 0.4 percent last month, the largest gain since July, after increasing 0.3 percent in December. Wholesale prices outside of food and energy were pushed up by higher drugs costs, which accounted for about 40 percent of the increase. Higher prices for light motor trucks and household appliances also contributed.

217,INTC,Gasoline pushes inflation up in January,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Gasoline prices jumped in January, leading overall consumer prices higher and offering a reminder of the risks energy costs pose to the economic recovery. Despite the warning signal, overall consumer prices rose just 0.2 percent, the Labor Department said on Friday, which is unlikely to ring alarm bells at the Federal Reserve. Strong jobs and factory data have eased worries U.S. economic growth could slow sharply, but tensions between Western nations and Iran still threaten to hand the economy a repeat of 2011 when a spike in energy prices hit the recovery hard. “The greatest concern is that geopolitical strains in the Middle East will spill over into the oil market, pushing prices higher in a replay of last year’s oil price spike,” economists at Bank of America said in a note to clients. For the Fed, an energy prices spike would represent a quandary: it could hurt the economy even as it boosts inflation. Gasoline prices increased 0.9 percent in January and they have continued to move higher this month. “Consumers are going to feel a gasoline pinch in the first half of this year,” said Chris Christopher, an economist at IHS Global Insight. The report also showed so-called core prices, which strip out food and energy costs, rose 0.2 percent. That pushed the increase over the last 12 months up to 2.3 percent, the fastest pace since September 2008. While the year-on-year reading on overall prices has been easing, the steady pick-up in core suggests inflation pressures are not subsiding as quickly as expected, and it could lead to some wariness at the Fed about launching another round of bond purchases to drive borrowing costs lower. “At the margin it does lean against the case for more (bond purchases),” said JPMorgan economist Michael Feroli. Graphic on January U.S. CPI: link.reuters.com/xyr66s U.S. stocks hovered near recent highs, with investors wary of making big bets heading into a holiday weekend when hopes are set for Greece’s bailout plan to be approved. Treasury debt prices fell and the dollar was flat against a basket of currencies. A separate report by the private Conference Board showed a gauge of future U.S. economic activity rose to a 3-1/2 year high in January on solid gains in manufacturing. Last month, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke left the door open to further Fed bond buying to boost growth, but a steady stream of upbeat data in recent weeks has led analysts to dial down their expectations for a further easing of monetary policy. In January, used car and truck prices fell 1.0 percent and new vehicle prices were flat, moderating the overall gain in core prices. Policymakers watch core prices closely because they see them as a better guide to inflation trends. Food also played a role in the overall increase in prices. Food costs rose 0.2 percent in January and were up 4.4 percent year-on-year. Worldwide, food prices rose in January for the first time in six months and HJ Heinz Co and Campbell Soup Co said on Friday that higher commodity costs have hurt sales volume. Despite the spike in U.S. gasoline prices last month, overall energy prices rose just 0.2 percent because electricity prices were flat and costs to consumers for piped natural gas services fell 2.9 percent. Even so, gasoline prices remain a threat to the economy, with oil hovering near $120 a barrel on Friday. Iran, which Western nations accuse of seeking to develop nuclear weapons, is facing sanctions that could cripple its oil exports. After rising throughout January, the national price for regular unleaded gasoline in the United States rose to $3.58 a gallon in the week through Monday, according to the Energy Information Administration. It had started the year around $3.32 a gallon. ",2172012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy/gasoline-pushes-inflation-up-in-january-idUSTRE7BM0AB20120217

220,INTC,Micron buys Intel stake in flash joint venture for $600 million,"(Reuters) - Micron Technology (MU.O) will pay $600 million to buy back Intel Corp’s (INTC.O) stake in two wafer factories as the chipmaker bets on the fast-growing NAND flash market to offset margin erosion in its mainstay memory chips. NAND memory, used in portable storage devices such as USB drives and smartphones, are fast replacing hard drives in notebooks — such as the super-thin Ultrabook laptops that Intel promotes. Intel had invested in the JV in 2006 to spur growth in the then-emerging technology. NAND has since gained prominence as computing power shifts to smartphones and tablets. As part of the agreement, Micron, the largest U.S.-based maker of computer memory chips, will continue to supply NAND chips to Intel. “Micron is going to get as much as a 30 percent more capacity from the deal and they would now be able to sell a significant portion of this back to Intel at an incremental profit,” Raymond James analyst Hans Mosesmann told Reuters. Intel pays Micron almost $1 billion annually for flash memory. The deal is expected to give Micron better margins on at least half of these sales, without increasing supply. Wells Fargo analyst David Wong said in a note that it made sense for Intel to enter into the initial joint venture to drive growth of NAND supply, and it is now an appropriate time to exit given Micron’s lead in investing in the venture. Micron got about 40 percent of its revenue from DRAM chips — used as primary memory in PCs — in the last fiscal but oversupply has dented margins. Top DRAM maker Elpida Memory 6665.T filed for bankruptcy on Monday. Analysts expect Micron to buy some of Elpida’s NAND factories. Intel and Micron formed the joint venture, IM Flash Technologies, investing $1.2 billion each in cash, notes and assets. As part of the sale, Intel will get half of the $600 million in cash while the rest will be deposited with Micron, to be refunded or adjusted against Intel’s future purchases. “It’s a great deal for Micron, they’re getting it for the cheap,” Raymond James’ Mosesmann said. According to Intel’s latest annual filing, the carrying value of its stake in the JV stood at $1.3 billion as of December 31. On Tuesday, the companies said Intel sold the stake at about their book value. “Intel might take a charge of as much as $700 million for this transaction,” Wells Fargo’s Wong said. The transaction is expected to close during the first half of this year, subject to certain conditions, the companies said. Boise, Idaho-based Micron will buy Intel’s stake in their Manassas, Virginia, and Singapore factories. The $3 billion Singapore facility, capable of making almost half of the JV’s capacity of flash memory, started production last April. The JV’s third manufacturing facility in Utah will continue to operate with minimal changes, the two companies said in a statement. Micron shares jumped 7 percent to $9.16, and were trading at $9.02 in afternoon trade on the Nasdaq. The stock gained 7 percent on Monday after Elpida’s bankruptcy filing.

222,INTC,Intel launches high-end server chip for the cloud,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp took the wraps off its newest “Xeon” server chip on Tuesday, seeking to capitalize on an explosion of Internet traffic sparked by Web-based cloud computing, social networking and growing smartphone and tablet computer use. The company’s “Xeon E5-2600” family of processors delivers up to 80 percent better performance than previous platforms while consuming less energy, Diane Bryant, in charge of Intel’s data center business, told reporters. It is designed to support the servers and workstations that handle what Intel estimates will be 33 percent annual growth of data traffic through 2015. Intel has already shipped its new platform to a host of server manufacturers. It said several - including Hewlett-Packard Co, Dell Inc, IBM, Oracle Corp and Cisco Systems Inc - are expected to announce Xeon-based server platforms on Tuesday. Smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices is also stepping up investments in enterprise processors. Last week, the perennial runner-up to Intel announced that it would buy micro-server player SeaMicro for $334 million, getting into an emergent, power-efficient server technology. AMD has lost ground to Intel in the server market in past years but hopes SeaMicro can help its expansion into low-power solutions in massive data centers. But Intel executives said their own Xeon E5 platform can improve energy efficiency by more than 50 percent in some cases versus the previous generation. “We did look at SeaMicro’s fabric technology. There are probably very few people they didn’t come to and shop their solution to,” Bryant said. “We were not impressed. We declined and very soon after our competitor acquired them.” Shares in Intel held steady at about $26.50 in afternoon trade, while AMD’s stock was down about 3 percent at $6.86. While Intel lags Qualcomm and Samsung Electronics in selling processors for smartphones and tablets, Intel executives have pointed to their server business as key to capitalizing on fast growth in the mobile market. The popularity of smartphones and other mobile gadgets has increased the need for massive computer centers that store data and feed email, videos and other information to those devices. UBS expects spending on data centers to surge 49 percent this year, driven by the likes of Apple, Facebook and Google. At Tuesday’s event, Intel trotted out a variety of clients to demonstrate how its new platform might be employed. German automaker BMW said it was using Xeon-based servers to keep its luxury cars linked to the Internet. “Soon we will have more than 10 million vehicles connected and that will lead us to 1 terabyte of data volume per day,” said Mario Muller, BMW vice president of IT infrastructure.

There are probably very few people they didn’t come to and shop their solution to,” Bryant said. “We were not impressed. We declined and very soon after our competitor acquired them.” Shares in Intel held steady at about $26.50 in afternoon trade, while AMD’s stock was down about 3 percent at $6.86. While Intel lags Qualcomm and Samsung Electronics  in selling processors for smartphones and tablets, Intel executives have pointed to their server business as key to capitalizing on fast growth in the mobile market. The popularity of smartphones and other mobile gadgets has increased the need for massive computer centers that store data and feed email, videos and other information to those devices. UBS expects spending on data centers to surge 49 percent this year, driven by the likes of Apple, Facebook and Google. At Tuesday’s event, Intel trotted out a variety of clients to demonstrate how its new platform might be employed. German automaker BMW said it was using Xeon-based servers to keep its luxury cars linked to the Internet. “Soon we will have more than 10 million vehicles connected and that will lead us to 1 terabyte of data volume per day,” said Mario Muller, BMW vice president of IT infrastructure.",3062012,http://www.reuters.com/article/intel/update-2-intel-launches-high-end-server-chip-for-the-cloud-idUSL2E8E67FM20120306
224,INTC,Intel launches high-end server chip for the cloud,"March 6 (Reuters) - Intel Corp formally launched its newest high-end “Xeon” server chip on Tuesday, seeking to capitalize on an explosion of Internet traffic sparked by Web-based cloud computing, social networking and expanding use of smartphones and tablets. The company’s “Xeon E5-2600” family of processors delivers up to 80 percent better performance than previous platforms, while consuming less energy, Intel said in a statement. It is designed to support the servers and workstations that handle what Intel estimates will be 33 percent annual growth of  data traffic through to 2015. Intel has promoted its new platform to a host of server manufacturers. It said several — including Hewlett-Packard Co , Dell Inc, IBM, Oracle Corp  and Cisco Systems Inc — are expected to announce Xeon-based server platforms on Tuesday.

229,INTC,Intel's supply chain chief says ready for mobile,"SANTA CLARA, California (Reuters) - Intel’s manufacturing whiz and new chief operating officer, Brian Krzanich, says he has fine-tuned his supply chain to meet expected demand for chips for smartphones and tablets. Krzanich, whose January promotion marks him as a forerunner to one day become chief executive, said his focus has been shortening turnaround times in the top chipmaker’s cutting-edge factories — improvements he said have become key in the fragmented mobile market. “We will start to see more and more of our capacity and our output go to things that are mobile, like phones and tablets and other devices,” Krzanich told Reuters. Krzanich was already in charge of Intel’s manufacturing, including a $12.5 billion capital spending budget for 2012, as well as much of the company’s day-to-day operations. As COO, he is now also in charge of Intel’s IT and human resources departments. Intel has fallen far behind in processors for smartphones and tablets like Apple’s iPad, a market dominated by chips based on technology from Britain’s ARM Holdings and made by companies like Qualcomm and Texas Instruments. The Santa Clara, California, chipmaker’s new Medfield chip has been chosen for a few upcoming smartphones from Lenovo, Motorola Mobility and other manufacturers, accomplishments seen by Wall Street as a good start. Intel is betting its lead in manufacturing technology will help it win more ground from rivals, and it is speeding up the rate at which it uses its most advanced factories to make mobile chips. As head of manufacturing, Krzanich shortened the time it takes Intel to build a cutting-edge plant and launch it into production. Krzanich, a three-decade Intel veteran, said that in the past five years he has halved the time it takes to manufacture a component, and cut by a similar amount the time it takes from receiving an order to delivering it. “What have I brought to manufacturing? Speed and agility,” he said. “That’s exactly what the PC business and exactly what the phone business will need.” Chief Executive Otellini was COO until 2005. Vice Chairman Andy Bryant, named executive chairman last year, had been handling some of the COO duties before Krzanich was promoted.

But Samsung said the court ruled that it could seek damages over the use of Intel chips, giving the South Korean firm a partial victory in the latest skirmish between the world’s biggest smartphone makers. Samsung and Apple are locked in escalating global patent battle, as they jostle for the top position in the booming smartphone and tablet markets. Apple first the fired salvo in April 2011, arguing Samsung had “slavishly” copied its iPad and iPhone and since then both have taken legal action against each other in several countries claiming patent infringements. Samsung supplies mobile processors to power iPad and iPhone and counts Apple as its biggest customer. The Hague court ruled on Wednesday that Samsung can not assert 3G patents against Apple products using Qualcomm’s  baseband chips, as Samsung has a licensing deal with the U.S. chipmaker. But the court ruled that Samsung can proceed to  claim such rights against products that use Intel  chips, according to Samsung. “(The) ruling by the Hague court provides Samsung with a legal basis to move forward with the protection of our patent rights,” the South Korean firm said in a statement. “Samsung has and will continue to stand ready to meet its obligations in licensing its technology on fair and reasonable terms.” The Dutch ruling comes as Apple returned to Samsung for the initial supply of touch-screen panels to make its latest iPad, which was unveiled last week and will hit store shelves on Friday, deepening their business ties, according to industry sources.",3152012,http://www.reuters.com/article/samsung-apple/corrected-samsung-loses-bid-to-ban-iphone-ipad-sales-in-netherlands-idUSL4E8EEAAB20120315

Oracle decided to discontinue support last year, saying Intel Corp (INTC.O) made it clear that the chip was nearing the end of its life and that Intel was shifting its focus to its x86 microprocessor. But HP argues that the companies agreed support for Itanium would continue in an earlier settlement reached over Oracle’s hiring of former HP chief executive Mark Hurd, and has sued Oracle in a California state court, calling Oracle’s decision “anti-customer”. Oracle has countersued, accusing HP of false advertising for failing to disclose the terms of its contract with Intel. Relations between HP and Oracle deteriorated rapidly when Oracle quickly hired Hurd after he left HP in 2010 amid questions about his relationship with a female contractor, with Oracle CEO Larry Ellison publicly criticizing HP’s handling of the matter. HP later filed a trade secrets lawsuit against Hurd related to the Oracle hire and although that was soon settled, the firms’ mutual acrimony only got worse when HP later hired Ellison’s arch-rival Leo Apotheker as CEO. Apotheker was replaced by Meg Whitman last September. Seeking judgment before the trial which is scheduled to start May 31, HP argued on Monday at the time of the Hurd settlement, Oracle General Counsel Dorian Daley had said the deal meant that the companies “would continue to work together” as they had. Oracle argued in its filing that Daley never intended the Hurd agreement to be anything more than a symbolic statement, as opposed to a legal commitment. “We don’t believe, nor do we think HP really believes, that a settlement agreement relating to Mark Hurd’s employment could possibly obligate Oracle to write new software for a platform that is clearly (at the) end of life,” Oracle attorney Dan Wall said in a statement.

236,INTC,Ex-Intel employee pleads guilty to theft charges,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A former Intel Corp employee who allegedly stole from the chipmaker documents worth hundreds of millions of dollars pleaded guilty on Friday to five counts of wire fraud.

239,INTC,"Intel revenue forecast beats, but stock falls","(Reuters) - Top chipmaker Intel Corp forecast revenue above expectations, as demand for personal computers remained resilient in the face of consumers’ growing preference for tablets and other mobile gadgets. But investors, accustomed to Intel’s beating forecasts, sold the company’s stock, which had rallied 17 percent this year, following the news. Shaky economies in Europe and the United States, a growing consumer preference for tablets, and a recent shortage of hard drives due to flooding in Thailand have taken a toll on the PC industry. Still, demand in China and other emerging economies has helped sustain PC growth, and Intel’s server business has been a winner from the buildout of servers behind the Internet and data consumed on smartphones. “Given the topline is slightly better than expected, it doesn’t seem like there’s a meaningful impact from tablets right now. The PC market is holding up pretty well,” said Srini Pajjuri, an analyst at CLSA. Despite weakness in the United States, global PC shipments in the first quarter grew 1.9 percent from the year-ago period, research firm Gartner said last week. That was better than the firm’s previous forecast of a 1.2 percent decline. Hoping to safeguard its position in PCs, Intel is heavily promoting a new class of instant-on, super-thin laptops dubbed “ultrabooks” that it hopes can stand up to the likes of Apple Inc’s Macbook Air, with some of the technological chic the iPad and other tablets epitomize. An upcoming launch of Intel’s newest PC processor, called Ivy Bridge, is expected to boost the company’s sales later this year, as is the launch of Microsoft Corp’s Windows 8 operating system later in 2012. Intel has struggled to find a foothold in smartphones and tablets, where processors based on ARM Holdings’ power-efficient chip designs are widely used. But Intel has recently shown some encouraging signs with announcements that its newest processors would be used in a handful of upcoming smartphones. Many investors are waiting to see how successful the new handsets become with consumers before declaring the chipmaker a serious player in the mobile market. But growing expectations that Intel will be able to compete in mobile have fueled some of the gain in its shares in recent months. The long-time technology bellwether said revenue in the current quarter would be $13.6 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts on average had expected $13.45 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Ahead of Intel’s earnings report, some analysts said they were optimistic the company would beat their own estimates. Intel’s stock trades at 11 times earnings, after a 17 percent gain so far this year. The long-awaited Windows 8 is expected to cause a jump in PC sales, but the operating system will be Microsoft’s first version of Windows that is compatible with chips designed by ARM Holdings, a rival of Intel. Intel could face new competition in low-end PCs from companies like Nvidia Corp and Qualcomm. The world’s leading chipmaker said revenue in the first quarter was $12.9 billion, up from $12.85 billion in the year-ago period and a bit higher than the $12.85 billion expected. GAAP net income in the first quarter was $2.74 billion, down from $3.16 billion in the year-ago period. GAAP earnings per share were 53 cents, better than the 50 cents expected. Intel said non-GAAP gross margins in the second quarter would be 63 percent, plus or minus 2 percentage points. Despite the relatively upbeat outlook, shares of Intel fell 2.81 percent in extended trade after closing up 0.23 percent at $28.47 on Nasdaq.

IBM, which also reported after the closing bell, posted first-quarter profit above Wall Street’s targets and the blue chip is closely watched as an indicator of enterprise IT spending. Completing a trio of major earnings released on Tuesday, Yahoo Inc, which is going through a massive internal overhaul, posted better than expected earnings. Intel: “It looks like a solid result and a good guide. “I would have liked to see a stronger enterprise computing number. We maybe got a little ahead of ourselves with expectations. The fundamentals are strong in cloud. “The quarter was a beat, and I don’t think that the tablet threat is growing. You could argue it’s getting less significant. The tablet seems to be going more and more into e-readers, 7-inch screens”, which are less of a threat to larger PCs. “I’m still expecting a strong second half of the year.” “Expectations were a little high and the stock had a good run going into earnings. The results and guidance are in line but there were slightly higher expectations. “Mobile is still small and probably not material at this point. Their bread and butter continues to be PCs. We think demand has mostly come from restocking in the channel and supply chain, rather than market demand. We may get more color on the call about that. Advanced Micro Devices, or “AMD is actually growing faster than Intel. They have been taking share on the notebook side.” “Revenues came in better than expected. The margin guidance for Q2 looks a little light, and that’s probably why the stock is down. “Given the topline is slightly better than expected, it doesn’t seem like there’s a meaningful impact from tablets right now. The PC market is holding up pretty well.” “IBM has been on a great tear here. I think the stock was priced for perfection. There’s a little bit of profit taking here. “Revenue was a little light relative to expectations. They did a good job on the bottom line. The guidance was good. “At the end of the day the numbers looked fine to me. “What they’re doing is maximizing their operating margins by making sure they’re not taking on revenue opportunities that aren’t going to give them high margins. At the end of the day there’s a lot of pruning going on here. “The important part is they continue to expand earnings. EPS looked pretty good. “The black eye is systems and technology. Their hardware business was down 7 percent year over year. The area that continues to shine is software. That was up 6 percent year over year.” Yahoo: “Very modestly ahead of expectations, disappointing display results (down 4 percent), that is obviously their most important business. “Yahoo continues to struggle in the Internet advertising space. “Investors are anxious to hear how (CEO Scott) Thompson can turn this around and are largely skeptical he can do it. It’s going to be hard for him to articulate a convincing strategy but investors are all ears now.” “Here is the one piece that is always sad about Yahoo. Their income from operations was about $169 million and their earning and equity interest was about $172 million. “Their minority stake in their investments is generating more profit than their core business. “So far Scott has done the right things. He is bringing in some of his own people, he’s taking costs out of the system. His first quarter out of the gate, he controls what he can control, which is earnings.” ",4172012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-earnings/instant-view-intel-ibm-yahoo-in-earnings-trifecta-idUSBRE83G1JB20120417

Chesapeake Energy Corp dropped 5.5 percent to $18.06 and was among the most actively traded stocks on the New York Stock Exchange after a Reuters report that CEO Aubrey K. McClendon did not disclose loans of as much as $1.1 billion over the last three years against his stake in thousands of the company’s oil and natural gas wells. The stock fell as low as $17.17, its lowest since July 2009. International Business Machines Corp and Intel Corp ranked among the biggest drags on the Dow. IBM missed its revenue forecast, while investors said Intel’s results failed to make a “bull case” for the stock. IBM shares slipped 3.5 percent to $200.13 while Intel shares fell 1.8 percent to $27.95. The PHLX semiconductor index dropped 0.9 percent. The lackluster reports from the two technology heavyweights came at the start of what has so far been a strong earnings season. On Tuesday, the S&P; 500 had its best day in a month as Coca-Cola Co led the day’s round of solid earnings and concerns eased over the euro zone’s debt crisis. Tuesday’s rally also gave both the Dow and the Nasdaq their biggest one-day percentage gains since March 13. “Both Intel and IBM have led to some profit-taking today, with both companies posting decent reports, but disappointing investors for different reasons,” said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at RDM Financial in Westport, Connecticut. “If you want to be an optimist, you could point to the fact that the market didn’t sell off all that much, given the solid advance we saw yesterday.” The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 82.79 points, or 0.63 percent, to close at 13,032.75. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index shed 5.64 points, or 0.41 percent, to 1,385.14. The Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 11.37 points, or 0.37 percent, to 3,031.45. After the closing bell, shares of Qualcomm fell 3.3 percent to $64.77 as the chipmaker provided a disappointing quarterly and full-year outlook. In contrast, shares of eBay shot up 7.6 percent to $38.60 in extended-hours trading following the release of its results, which topped expectations. Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist of Robert W.

246,INTC,"Intel eyes sales pickup, investors cautious","(Reuters) - Top chipmaker Intel Corp posted earnings confirming the PC industry is alive — but not kicking — and said sales would accelerate in the second half of the year with a powerful new PC processor. In a first-quarter earnings report that did not inspire investors to push Intel’s recently high-flying stock further, the company also said costs associated with ramping up new production lines would hurt gross margins more than expected. “It’s not that they disappointed, they just didn’t give us the bull case. In previous quarters they blew the numbers out of the water,” said Patrick Wang, an analyst at Evercore Partners. The long-time technology bellwether is ramping up production of its newest PC processor, codenamed Ivy Bridge, which is expected to drive sales later this year and power a new crop of super-thin laptops dubbed “ultrabooks.” But the costs of upgrading the factories where the chips are being made is temporarily hurting margins, Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told a conference call. That was bad news to Wall Street, which has pushed shares of Intel 17 percent higher so far this year. “They had strong execution for the most part, and in-line expectations for the PC market. But from a investor standpoint you have a multi-year high stock price, very much priced for perfection. That gross margin guidance, while understandable, was not perfection,” said Cody Acree, an analyst at Williams Financial Group. Intel said non-GAAP gross margins in the second quarter would be 62 percent, plus or minus 2 percentage points, down from 64 percent in the first quarter. Intel’s full-year gross margin forecast of 64 percent was unchanged. Shaky economies in Europe and the United States, a growing consumer preference for tablets, and a recent shortage of hard drives due to flooding in Thailand last year have taken a toll on the PC industry. Demand in China and other emerging economies has helped sustain growth, and CFO Smith said business would pick up more as the industry recovers further from the hard-drive shortage and PC manufacturers replenish low component inventories. “As we ramp Ivy Bridge and people gear up for these really capable ultrabook sales in the last half of the year, you’ll start to see them refilling their pipelines with new products in the back half of this year,” Smith told Reuters. Intel is heavily promoting ultrabooks, which it hopes can stand up to the likes of Apple Inc’s Macbook Air, with some of the technological chic the iPad and other tablets epitomize. Some investors are concerned that expensive components used in them, like solid-state drives, make them too pricey for many consumers. Wang and other analysts speculate Intel may have to sacrifice profit margins on sales of its processors to help make ultrabooks affordable. Intel says manufacturers are finding ways to bring down costs of ultrabooks, and CEO Paul Otellini told analysts on the call he was confident of the chipmaker’s previous prediction the new light-weight PCs would account for 40 percent of all notebook sales by the end of the year. “I’m still very confident we can do that. All the signs are tracking there. Everything we’ve looked at since we first gave that number has gotten more positive, more designs, better price points,” Otellini said. Despite weakness in the United States, global PC shipments in the first quarter grew 1.9 percent from the year-ago period, research firm Gartner said last week. That was better than the firm’s previous forecast of a 1.2 percent decline. With worldwide PC sales barely growing, Intel has been racing to find a foothold in smartphones and tablets, where processors based on ARM Holdings’ power-efficient chip designs are widely used. It has recently shown some encouraging signs with announcements that its newest processors would be used in a handful of upcoming smartphones. Many investors are waiting to see how successful the new handsets become with consumers before declaring the chipmaker a serious player in the mobile market. Growing expectations that Intel will be able to compete in mobile have fueled some of the gain in its shares in recent months. Microsoft’s long-awaited launch of Windows 8 expected later this year is also likely to cause a jump in PC sales, but the operating system will be Microsoft’s first version of Windows that is compatible with chips designed by rival ARM. Intel could face new competition in low-end PCs from companies like Nvidia Corp and Qualcomm. Intel said revenue in the current quarter would be $13.6 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts on average had expected $13.45 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The world’s leading chipmaker said revenue in the first quarter was $12.9 billion, up from $12.85 billion in the year-ago period and a bit higher than the $12.85 billion expected. GAAP net income in the first quarter was $2.74 billion, down from $3.16 billion in the year-ago period. GAAP earnings per share were 53 cents, better than the 50 cents expected. Shares of Intel fell 2.81 percent in extended trade after closing up 0.23 percent at $28.47 on Nasdaq.

248,INTC,"Apple, Google, Intel fail to dismiss staff-poaching lawsuit","(Reuters) - Apple Inc, Google Inc, Intel Corp and four other technology companies were ordered by a judge to face an antitrust lawsuit claiming they illegally conspired not to poach each other’s employees. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, rejected the companies’ bid to dismiss claims brought under the federal Sherman antitrust law and California’s own antitrust law, the Cartwright Act. In a decision on Wednesday night, Koh said the existence of “Do Not Cold Call” agreements among various defendants “supports the plausible inference that the agreements were negotiated, reached, and policed at the highest levels” of the companies. “The fact that all six identical bilateral agreements were reached in secrecy among seven defendants in a span of two years suggests that these agreements resulted from collusion, and not from coincidence,” Koh added. Other defendants in the case included Adobe Systems Inc, Intuit Inc, Walt Disney Co’s Pixar unit and Lucasfilm Ltd. Koh dismissed a claim brought under California’s unfair competition law. Lawyers for the defendants were not immediately available for comment. The proposed class-action lawsuit was brought by five software engineers who accused the companies of conspiring to limit pay and job mobility by eliminating competition for labor, costing workers hundreds of millions of dollars. Their claims are similar to those raised in 2010 by the Department of Justice when it settled antitrust probes against the companies. Without admitting wrongdoing, the companies agreed not to take steps to restrict competition for workers, including setting limits on cold-calling and recruiting. Among the revelations stemming from the litigation was a 2007 email trail involving the late Steve Jobs and Eric Schmidt, then respectively Apple’s and Google’s chief executives, over Google’s apparent effort to recruit an Apple engineer. “I would be very pleased if your recruiting department would stop doing this,” Jobs wrote Schmidt, an Apple director at the time. Schmidt forwarded that email to various people, asking if they could “get this stopped.” Eventually, Google’s staffing director said the employee who recruited the engineer would be fired, and added: “Please extend my apologies as appropriate to Steve Jobs.” Joseph Saveri, a lawyer for the five plaintiff engineers, said their case remains on track for a June 2013 trial. “This is a significant step forward,” Saveri said in an email.

258,INTC,"Insight: As chip plants get pricey, U.S. risks losing edge","CHANDLER, Arizona (Reuters) - It goes by the anodyne moniker Fab 42, but the new Intel Corp factory being built in the Arizona desert is hardly a run-of-the-mill production facility. At $5 billion, it will be the most advanced chip factory ever constructed, producing microchips with transistors so tiny that over 100 million of them could fit on the head of a pin. And it represents a giant bet by the world’s largest semiconductor company that the United States can still be a good place to build things. If manufacturing is critical to jobs and long-term economic health, as many government and industry officials believe, then Fab 42 is an encouraging symbol of what could be. Yet many technology executives worry that Intel’s new factory is less a sign of things to come than the last gasp of an advanced manufacturing sector that could readily go the way of its lower-tech predecessors — to Asia. Those kinds of concerns have stoked an election-year debate on an old policy question: is there anything the U.S. can or should do to support manufacturing and the benefits that go with it? “There are a lot of companies that are moving operational resources out of the U.S. and I have a tough time getting my arms around that being a good thing for us long-term,” said Mark Adams, president of Micron Inc, the last remaining U.S. memory chip manufacturer and historically a champion of government cooperation with the industry. The loss of chip plants in the U.S. is not because labor is cheaper abroad — as in previous waves of manufacturing migration — but rather due to lower tax rates, complex international supply chains and abundant skilled workers. U.S. President Barack Obama has made “insourcing” manufacturing jobs a key economic policy goal, and proposed incentives aimed at supporting advanced manufacturing. His framework for business tax reform, unveiled in February, would cut the top corporate tax on manufacturing to 25 percent, and even lower for advanced manufacturers. He would also make permanent a temporary research and development credit, a change that has been popular among both political parties and could cost $99 billion over 10 years. His budget also calls for $2.2 billion to support advanced manufacturing R&D;, a 19 percent increase. The President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, which counts Google Inc Chairman Eric Schmidt among its members, has gone further, calling for the launch of an “Advanced Manufacturing Initiative.” Invoking Sematech, an industry consortium which the U.S. government supported in the 1980s to aid chip industry manufacturing, the council urged the government to “invest to overcome market failures, to ensure that new technologies and design methodologies are developed here.” But Obama’s push to involve the government in rebuilding U.S. manufacturing is controversial, with critics saying that most jobs attracted back to the United States would be low-paid and that U.S. companies are better off focusing on design and invention. They point to Apple Inc, arguably one of the world’s most innovative companies, and one that does no manufacturing. Chip industry executives stress that advanced manufacturing is less about jobs created directly, which are relatively few but well-paid, than maintaining the know-how that’s critical for long-term success. Intel’s efforts provide ammunition for both sides. The company has kept three-quarters of its manufacturing in the U.S. Yet Intel also says it’s cheaper to build overseas, and it could readily move more production offshore if it became more advantageous. Chip manufacturers with intricate supply chains look at a range of factors when they decide where to add new facilities, but with corporate tax rates as high as 39 percent, the United States is at a disadvantage compared with countries like Ireland, with a 12.5 percent tax rate, and Israel, at 24 percent, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Taiwan, Singapore, Israel and other countries keen to woo foreign investors have offered a range of tax breaks and R&D; tax credits that go beyond the perks available to manufacturers in the United States. Unlike simpler manufacturing industries like apparel, semiconductor factories employ relatively few people, making labor costs only a minor factor. They do need access to highly skilled local labor, but that’s becoming increasingly abundant as emerging economies like China become more sophisticated. MEGA-FABS The cost of building semiconductor “fabs,” or fabrication facilities, has been soaring for years, with each new generation of technology requiring more expensive and sophisticated production processes. That trend long ago prompted many U.S. chip companies to focus on design, and rely on contract manufacturers to build the products. That became more attractive as Asian companies like Taiwan’s TSMC invested heavily in huge new factories, often with government support. U.S. companies accounted for half of the global chip industry’s sales of about $300 billion last year, with U.S. plants producing some of the world’s most advanced and valuable semiconductors. But just 16 percent of the world’s chip manufacturing capacity is located in the United States, steady for the past three years but down from 23 percent a decade ago, according to SEMI, an industry association. U.S. semiconductor exports, inevitably, reflect the trend, dropping by $3 billion last year to $44 billion, according to U.S. trade data. That’s down more than a quarter from a 2001 peak of $60 billion. Most semiconductor R&D; still takes place in the United States, but it’s also declining in proportion to Europe, Israel, Singapore and other countries, according to a study commissioned by the Semiconductor Industry Association. Unsurprisingly, the U.S. R&D; decline is sharpest in the area specific to manufacturing chips. The challenge of competing in chip manufacturing is growing even more daunting as the industry approaches a major hurdle that is so formidable — but offers a huge advantage — that rivals have begun working together. Today, most fabs etch integrated circuits row after row onto silicon wafers measuring 300 millimeters across, which are then diced into individual chips. But the bigger the wafer, the cheaper each individual chip, so every few years, as technology improves, the industry moves to larger wafers. Upgrading to the new 450 mm wafer size — bigger than a large pizza — is harder than it sounds. Only a handful of players with deep pockets will be able to play, experts say. “There are something like 35 companies out there today that have 300 mm processing capability. There aren’t that many companies that will be able to jump to 450 mm fabs. We think that number’s probably five, maybe six,” said Mark Thirsk, a manufacturing expert at Linx Consulting. One of those companies will certainly be Intel. The company is sharply increasing its capital spending this year to $12.5 billion from about $10.8 billion in 2011. With fabs in Arizona, Oregon, New Mexico and Massachusetts, Intel makes about three quarters of its chips in the United States — and there are good reasons for it to keep favoring those locations. Adding a new fab onto an existing site is much cheaper than starting from scratch at a new location, and speeds up completion by as much as a year. Fab 42, which will be upgradable to accommodate larger wafer sizes, is adjacent to a facility opened in 2007. Intel’s top manufacturing experts, responsible for keeping its technology years ahead of rivals, are mostly at U.S. facilities, including a research center in Hillsboro, Oregon. As new manufacturing technologies are launched, Intel circulates engineers from its production fabs through Hillsboro to train and interact with experts there. That personal contact, where experience is shared between researchers and the engineers who run Intel’s fabs day-to-day, is invaluable to the innovative process, executives say. But Intel’s loyalty to the United States is not absolute. It has fabs in Ireland, Israel and even one in Dalian, China, launched in 2010. Intel may invest billions of dollars to expand or upgrade those sites in the future instead of in the United States if the benefits add up. “You look at the whole world. In Ireland, we’ve done some investment to prepare that for next-generation technology when the demand is such that I need to add it. They essentially would be a site that might get the next generation technology. Similarly, Israel,” said Josh Walden, Intel’s general manager in charge of building and operating its fabs. Intel has said it can cost $1 billion less to build a fab abroad thanks to tax incentives and other perks. Walden weighs those cost advantages against the benefit of building fabs close to the chipmaker’s R&D; staff and extensive U.S. infrastructure. Intel and other chipmakers want a lower corporate tax rate in the United States and a quicker process for approving the building of new facilities. Tech companies also want U.S. colleges to turn out more engineers to help fill hiring gaps, and to allow more foreigners graduating from U.S. universities to stay and work. Just 4 percent of U.S. undergraduate degrees awarded in 2008 were for engineering, compared to 19 percent in Asia, according to a recent report from the National Science Board. Washington’s current climate of spending cuts may not be ideal for discussing more support for industries showing no signs of imminent crisis. But the federal government in the past has pitched in to help the chip industry stay sharp. In the 1980s, when stiff competition from Japan had the U.S. memory chip industry against the ropes, the U.S. government spent $500 million to help Sematech improve equipment used across the industry, seen as key to national security and competitiveness. Now, California Congressman Mike Honda, whose constituency includes Silicon Valley, wants the Obama administration to put up money to make sure the 450 mm transition stays firmly rooted in the United States. “The government has always had a major role in everything from Kennedy saying we’re going to go to the moon to the development of the Internet,” Honda said. “If we don’t get in line and get in sync and be agile in this, we’re going to be left behind globally,” Honda said. Some government entities are already stepping up. New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo has championed a plan to spend $400 million on an engineering college in Albany as part of a wider deal for a consortium of Intel, TSMC, Samsung, IBM and GlobalFoundries to invest $4.4 billion there over five years, some of which will go toward the 450 mm leap. They will cooperate to set new standards, build and test prototypes, and help equipment makers redesign tools. “We’re trying to do it all together, fund it all together, share all the data and then say at any point you as a company can take that information, step away and take it home and start your own development,” Intel’s Chief Operating Officer Brian Krzanich told Reuters. Keen to attract more chip manufacturing to Europe, Belgian research institute IMEC and others are pushing for a government-funded coalition there to help tackle the move to 450 mm wafers. Rather than attracting jobs, executives say the best reason to make sure cutting-edge chip fabs keep getting built in the United States is because the very act of manufacturing leads to invention and new ideas that reverberate beyond the industry. “There are a lot of folks who take the view that everything will be fine for the U.S. as long as we keep innovation and high-level design functions here and we ship all the manufacturing overseas. I disagree with that,” said Ted Tewksbury, CEO of Integrated Device Technology, which has one of its facilities in Malaysia because of generous tax breaks. “If you’re totally removed from the way things are made, it is going to have an impact on your ability to innovate. That’s a very dangerous direction this country is going in.” (Editing by Jonathan Weber, Edwin Chan and Phil Berlowitz) ",5012012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-semiconductors-manufacturing/insight-as-chip-plants-get-pricey-u-s-risks-losing-edge-idUSBRE8400N920120501

264,INTC,Intel CEO plays down concerns about tech spending,"SANTA CLARA, California (Reuters) - Intel Corp Chief Executive Paul Otellini said that he was not seeing unexpected weakness in enterprise technology spending that Cisco Systems Inc CEO John Chambers cited when he forecast quarterly earnings below estimates. “This quarter is playing out as we thought. The enterprise is good, it’s not fantastic, so we don’t see a change in that,” Otellini said in answer to a question at Intel’s annual investor day on Thursday. Shares of Cisco, which relies on government and corporate spending on Internet gear, dropped more than 10 percent on Thursday, a day after the company released its financial results. “I think John’s comments were focused on Europe in particular. We haven’t seen any change in Europe demand on the enterprise side,” Otellini said. Much of the presentations by Otellini and other Intel executives showcased the chipmaker’s long-awaited push into smartphones as well as ultra-thin laptops. Intel offered little new hope to investors concerned about languid PC sales. Otellini also forecast that Intel, with its deep pockets, would survive as one of a handful of leading-edge chip manufacturers as the sector moves toward larger and costlier factories. With the industry preparing to increase the size of the silicon wafers it uses, letting manufacturers fit more chips on each, future leading-edge factories will cost more than $10 billion each to build, compared with about $5 billion now, Otellini said. Intel, Samsung Electronics and contract manufacturer TSMC will be among the few companies able to build those larger factories and keep them working full time, experts have said. Reflecting higher costs in cutting-edge chip manufacturing, Intel is boosting its capital spending this year to $12.5 billion from about $10.8 billion in 2011. “When you see a capex of ten or twelve billion you say, ‘Oh my god.’ But you forget that our (annual) revenue is approaching $60 billion,” Otellini told an analyst who questioned Intel’s higher spending. Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said he expects gross margins next year to remain at the high end of Intel’s recent historical range of 60 percent to 65 percent. With worldwide PC shipments barely growing, Intel has been racing to establish a foothold in smartphone and tablet markets, where processors based on ARM Holdings’ power-efficient chip designs are widely used. Last month in India, Lava International launched the first smartphone using Intel’s new Medfield processor, and the device has received respectable reviews from benchmark testers. “We’re getting awfully good reviews for our first phones,” Otellini told investors at an annual Intel event. “We have ambitions; you’ll see more announcements over time and very cool capabilities built into phones.” Before declaring that Intel is a serious player in the mobile market, many investors are waiting to see how successful the new handsets become with consumers. Growing expectations that Intel will be able to compete have fueled gains in its shares in recent months. Intel is heavily promoting a PC category it has dubbed ultrabooks, similar to Apple Inc’s Macbook Air and offering some of the technological chic of the iPad and other tablets. Major manufacturers like Asus and Hewlett Packard are launching ultrabooks, but some investors are concerned that the expensive components used in them, such as solid-state drives, make them too pricey for many consumers. Intel Vice President Kirk Skaugen, in charge of the ultrabook push, said the laptops are aimed at prices starting at $700. He said consumers would be willing to spend more than normal on PCs delivering premium features. Demonstrations of future gadgets, including an ultrabook with a touchscreen display, won polite applause. But analysts said they heard little to reduce concerns that Intel may sacrifice profit margins on sales of its processors to make ultrabooks affordable and help drive sales. “We’re on track to meet our goal of 40 percent of consumer notebooks this holiday season being ultrabooks,” Otellini said. Last month, Intel posted quarterly earnings that failed to inspire gains in its recently high-flying stock and also said costs associated with ramping up new production lines for its new Ivy Bridge chips would hurt gross margins more than expected. Global PC shipments in the first quarter grew a tepid 1.9 percent from the year-ago period, according to research firm Gartner. Helped by emerging markets, the Ivy Bridge processor and ultrabooks, Intel expects PC shipments this year to grow by a “high-single digits” percentage. Otellini said manufacturers are working on 20 tablets using Intel processors and Microsoft’s long-awaited Windows 8 platform, expected later this year.

Last month in India, Lava International launched the first smartphone using Intel’s new Medfield processor, and the device has received respectable reviews from benchmark testers. “We’re getting awfully good reviews for our first phones,” Otellini told investors at an annual Intel event. “We have ambitions; you’ll see more announcements over time and very cool capabilities built into phones.” Before declaring that Intel is a serious player in the mobile market, many investors are waiting to see how successful the new handsets become with consumers. Growing expectations that Intel will be able to compete have fueled gains in its shares in recent months. Intel is heavily promoting a PC category it has dubbed ultrabooks, similar to Apple Inc’s Macbook Air and offering some of the technological chic of the iPad and other tablets. Major manufacturers like Asus and Hewlett Packard  are launching ultrabooks, but some investors are concerned that the expensive components used in them, such as solid-state drives, make them too pricey for many consumers. Intel Vice President Kirk Skaugen, in charge of the ultrabook push, said the laptops are aimed at prices starting at $700. He said consumers would be willing to spend more than normal on PCs delivering premium features. Demonstrations of future gadgets, including an ultrabook with a touchscreen display, won polite applause. But analysts said they heard little to reduce concerns that Intel may sacrifice profit margins on sales of its processors to make ultrabooks affordable and help drive sales. “We’re on track to meet our goal of 40 percent of consumer notebooks this holiday season being ultrabooks,” Otellini said. Last month, Intel posted quarterly earnings that failed to inspire gains in its recently high-flying stock and also said costs associated with ramping up new production lines for its new Ivy Bridge chips would hurt gross margins more than expected. Global PC shipments in the first quarter grew a tepid 1.9 percent from the year-ago period, according to research firm Gartner. Helped by emerging markets, the Ivy Bridge processor and ultrabooks, Intel expects PC shipments this year to grow by a “high-single digits” percentage. Otellini said manufacturers are working on 20 tablets using Intel processors and Microsoft’s long-awaited Windows 8 platform, expected later this year.",5102012,http://www.reuters.com/article/intel/update-3-intel-ceo-plays-down-concerns-about-tech-spending-idUSL1E8GABDG20120510

With worldwide PC sales barely growing, Intel Corp  has been racing to find a foothold in smartphone and tablet markets, where processors based on ARM Holdings Pls’s  power-efficient chip designs are widely used. Last month in India, Lava International launched the first smartphone using Intel’s new Medfield processor and the device has received respectable reviews from benchmark testers. Intel has also announced the Medfield chips would be used in upcoming phones from Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc, Lenovo Group Ltd ZTE  and Orange. “We’re getting awfully good reviews for our first phones,” Otellini told investors at an annual Intel event. “We have ambitions; you’ll see more announcements over time and very cool capabilities built into phones.” Many investors are waiting to see how successful the new handsets become with consumers before declaring that the chipmaker is a serious player in the mobile market.

Some investors are concerned that the expensive components used in them, such as solid-state drives, make them too pricey for many consumers. They worry Intel may sacrifice profit margins on sales of its processors to help make ultrabooks affordable. Otellini said sales were on track and would pick up in the second half of 2012 as more manufacturers start using Intel’s new Ivy Bridge processor. “We’re on track to meet our goal of 40 percent of consumer notebooks this holiday season being ultrabooks,” Otellini said. Last month, Intel posted quarterly earnings that failed to inspire gains in its recently high-flying stock and also said costs associated with ramping up new production lines for the Ivy Bridge chips would hurt gross margins more than expected. Otellini said manufacturers are working on 20 tablets using Intel processors and Microsoft’s long-awaited Windows 8 platform, expected later this year. He also forecast that Intel, with its deep pockets, would become one of an increasingly smaller group of leading-edge chip manufacturers as the sector moves toward larger and costlier factories. With the industry preparing to increase the size of the silicon wafers it uses, letting manufacturers fit more chips on each, future leading-edge factories will cost over $10 billion each to build, compared with about $5 billion now, Otellini added.",5102012,http://www.reuters.com/article/intel/intels-ceo-talks-up-smartphones-and-thin-laptops-idUSL1E8G9GEG20120510
267,INTC,AMD's CEO catches Intel's wave of sleek laptops,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - PC chipmaker AMD’s chief executive is betting that its larger rival Intel has overestimated consumers’ willingness to pay top dollar for a new category of premium laptops. Riding the coat-tails of Intel’s most expensive marketing push in a decade, new processors from AMD have been chosen for a handful of upcoming laptops in a wave of sleek personal computers with features like “instant on” made popular by tablets. Targeting mainstream shoppers, thin laptops with AMD’s chips, previously code named Trinity, are set to sell in the $600 range, similar to many of the bulkier laptops now on the market and significantly cheaper than the high-end, Intel-powered ones increasingly appearing in stores. “It seems like an opportunity to steal the bacon and go in there and capture this huge opportunity that someone else generated,” AMD Chief Executive Rory Read told Reuters in an interview. “They missed where the sweet spot of the market was.” Intel has coined “Ultrabooks” to refer to svelte laptops using its processors, with high-quality features like solid-state drives and metal cases. AMD, always struggling to keep up with its much larger competitor, has been referring more generically to ultrathin laptops. Hewlett Packard last week unveiled a new “Sleekbook” lineup, with thin models using chips from both AMD and Intel. All three companies are counting on thin laptops to energize PC sales dulled by a growing preference for tablets. Intel, whose processors are used in 80 percent of the world’s PCs, has invested $300 million in an investment fund to help smaller companies develop technology to use in future Ultrabooks. The chipmaker’s executives last week said that by the holiday season, Ultrabooks will account for 40 percent of all consumer laptop sales. AMD’s Read said prices for Ultrabooks would be too high for Intel to hit that target. “You get up to those premium price points in a Windows type environment and there isn’t the scale to do that. But if you get into mainstream, there’s a big opportunity,” Read said. Intel executives told analysts at their annual meeting last Thursday that PC and component manufacturers in recent years focused too much on bringing down prices and forgot to add improved features to keep laptops exciting. Intel Vice President Kirk Skaugen, leading the Ultrabook push, said consumers would pay more for laptops with premium features, which next year will include touch displays. “We think the experience we’re delivering, people are going to be willing to pay for and it only gets better in 2013,” he told investors. Apple’s MacBook Air, seen by many consumers as the creme de la creme of laptops, sells for $999 and up. Analysts have speculated the Cupertino, California, company may drop the prices of future models in response to the Ultrabook push. While AMD stakes out territory at the low end of the price range for ultrathin laptops, analysts believe Intel may have trouble persuading consumers to spend extra on Microsoft Windows-based computers that lack the Apple brand. “It ultimately comes down to whether Intel is going to be able to enable the supply chain to develop an Ultrabook that is competitive with the MacBook Air at whatever new low price they’re going to be selling at,” said Patrick Wang, an analyst at Evercore Partners.

269,INTC,Intel eyes future with computers that learn,"TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Intel Corp is launching research in Israel into technology that mimics the human brain and develops devices that “learn” about their user. “Machine learning is such a huge opportunity,” Justin Rattner, Intel’s chief technology officer, told reporters in Tel Aviv. “Despite their name, smartphones are rather dumb devices. My smartphone doesn’t know anything more about me than when I got it,” he added. “All of these devices will come to know us as individuals, will very much tailor themselves to us.” The research, to be carried out by the Intel Collaborative Research Institute for Computational Intelligence along with specialists from the Technion in Haifa and the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, is aimed at enabling new applications, such as small, wearable computers that can enhance daily life. For example if a user leaves his car keys in the house, the device will in the first week remember where he left them and by the second week will remind the user to pick up his keys before leaving home, Rattner said. Such devices, which continually record what the user is doing, will be available by 2014 or 2015, he said. “Within five years all of the human senses will be in computers and in 10 years we will have more transistors in one chip than neurons in the human brain,” said Moody Eden, president of Intel Israel. Rattner said Intel is already implementing the new technology in digital signs it created for Adidas. The signs determine whether the shopper is male or female, adult or child and shows shoes suitable to that person. He said this was part of Intel’s expansion beyond its traditional semiconductor business.

271,INTC,Intel set to rise on move into mobile-Barrons,"May 27 (Reuters) - Shares of computer chip maker Intel Corp  could rise as much as 50 percent over the next two years as the company pushes into smart phones and other wireless mobile devices, according to a report in Barron’s financial newspaper. The growth in cloud computing — the storage and transmission of remote data — should also give Intel shares a boost as several major storage providers use Intel processors in their servers, the report in the May 28 edition of the weekly newspaper said. Intel’s new lower-power chips will grab a bigger share in smartphones in India, China, France, the U.K. and the United States over the next several months, the report said. “Intel will be a formidable competitor in the smartphone and tablet markets shortly,” Todd Lowenstein, a portfolio manager for HighMark Capital Management, is quoted as saying in the Barron’s article, adding that has not yet been factored into the share price. He has a 24-month price target of $38 to $40 on Intel shares.

272,INTC,Intel inspired by aerospace to make sturdier laptops,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Engineers at Intel Corp are applying lessons from aircraft design to create sturdier laptops in a bid to reduce the prices of the new ultra-thin computers the top chipmaker is promoting heavily. Intel is counting on the super-thin laptops, a category it has dubbed ultrabooks, to add some pizzazz to a PC market languishing due to the growing popularity of Apple Inc’s iPad. Models expected later this year will have large touch screens, “instant on” responsiveness and razor-thin dimensions - all expensive features that have left some on Wall Street wondering if they might be too expensive for average consumers. Engineers at Intel’s Dupont, Washington R&D; center, including former Boeing Co employees, have come up with a design method to make plastic laptop cases as strong as more-expensive metal ones typically used in ultrabooks, said Ben Broili, head of the team. He said that may cut the cost of future ultrabooks by between $25 and $75 by letting manufactures use plastic cases instead of metal ones without sacrificing quality. Their work is an example of the steps Intel is taking to find ways to make future ultrabooks more affordable - without cutting the prices of its processors. At a meeting with analysts last month, Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini said upcoming ultrabooks would be available for as little as $699, but many are expected to be priced nearer to $1,000 or more. Borrowing from product design methods used in the aerospace industry, the engineers have found that hard drives, motherboards and other components that make up the guts of a PC can be laid out in ways that make the laptops structure much stronger. “We didn’t develop a new material. We are able to use an existing plastic with an existing manufacturing technology,” he told Reuters in a telephone interview. “It just requires some more upfront thought initially about how you lay your system out and how you can bring these things together and tie them in.” Different components in the laptop can be leveraged to support its chassis, or even dissipate heat from the processor, he said. “There is no one size fits all,” Broili added. “We’re trying to enable the entire industry. You can make trades, move stuff around; and if you don’t want your hard drive here, then move it. You have a menu you can pick from and see what you win or lose from a cost and quality standpoint.” Typically priced above $200 each, Intel’s processors are the costliest component in laptops. Smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices is selling its new Trinity chips for less in a bid to undercut Intel in thin laptops. Laptops with metal cases tend to be sturdier than laptops with plastic cases, but they cost more. To get an idea of the structural quality of any laptop, Broili recommends lifting it up by a front corner while it is open and watching how much it flexes. Intel has already held a seminar in Taiwan to demonstrate its new design technique to PC design engineers and it is promoting it with specific manufacturers. At the Computex technology show in Taipei, Taiwan, next week, PC manufactures are set to unveil dozens of ultrabooks using Intel’s newest Ivy Bridge processors. They will also demonstrate future models with touch screens, based on Microsoft Corps’s Windows 8 platform, which is expected out later this year. Broili said Intel engineers are working on other ways to improve ultrabooks, including tweaks to motherboards, touch screens and Wifi. Separately, Intel launched a $300 million fund last year to invest in small companies focused on technologies complementing ultrabooks, such as improved battery life. A few ultrabook models launched this year have been reviewed as nice but pricey, leaving some analysts skeptical the category will attract mainstream shoppers. Otellini has said Intel is on track to reach its goal that ultrabooks account for 40 percent of all consumer notebooks sold by the end of the year. Helped by emerging markets, the Ivy Bridge processor and ultrabooks, Intel expects PC shipments this year to grow by a “high-single digits” percentage.

275,INTC,Insight: Intel's plans for virtual TV come into focus,"NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel is counting on facial-recognition technology for targeted ads and a team of veteran entertainment dealmakers to win over reluctant media partners for its new virtual television service. But so far it’s proving a challenge to get the service off the ground, thanks to an unwillingness on the part of major media content providers to let Intel unbundle and license specific networks and shows at a discount to what cable and satellite partners pay. Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, has kept its strategy to launch a slimmed down cable TV service under wraps as the tech giant risks getting into a completely new line of business. According to five sources who have been negotiating with Intel for months, the company is emphasizing a set-top box employing Intel technology that can distinguish who is watching, potentially allowing Intel to target advertising. The set-top box pitched by Intel doesn’t identify specific people, but it could provide general data about viewers’ gender or whether they’re adults or children to help target advertising, two sources said. Intel’s plans put it in the middle of Silicon Valley’s battle for the living room. Heavyweights such as Apple, Amazon and Google believe the $100 billion U.S. cable television ecosystem - dominated by major distributors such as Comcast and DirecTV Group and program makers like Walt Disney Co and Time Warner Inc. - is ripe for disruption for reasons ranging from shifting viewer habits to ever-increasing programming costs. While none of these companies have so far been able to make major inroads, Intel thinks it can build a better set-top box and over-the-top subscription service to deliver TV content to consumers, even though the initiative catapults it into virgin market territory. A successful TV service showcasing Intel technology could be a big step toward making its chips prevalent in more living room devices. “If they can create a virtual network and it incorporates proprietary Intel technology, they could certainly bring something different to the subscription TV model.” said JMP analyst Alex Gauna. Intel’s offering aims to exploit one of the TV industry’s major issues: the reliability, or lack thereof, of Nielsen ratings data on audiences. Nielsen has long been the dominant provider of TV ratings, but the accuracy of its data has come under attack by some network programmers, who argue that its polling system of 50,000 homes is antiquated for the digital age. For its part, Intel claims that the new interactive features in its set-top box would add greater value to TV advertising and help offset reduced revenue from licensing fees for network owners. “They’ve told us the technology is going to be so much more interactive with ads that you can make more money. But it’s just a little unproven,” said one executive who has been involved in the talks. An Intel representative declined to comment for this story. Chip features making it easier for Hollywood studios to protect content streamed to computers, as well as tools for detecting faces and analyzing audiences, are examples of current proprietary technology that Intel would like to see widely adopted. BEYOND PCs While Intel’s processors power 80 percent of the world’s PCs, its chips have not achieved a significant presence in smartphones, tablets and other interconnected devices. Intel executives say they are eager to make sure its semiconductors play major roles in new markets with big growth potential. According to a company source, ensuring that its chips become prevalent in home entertainment devices would be the driving reason behind any Internet TV service it launches. Comcast, for instance, recently announced the gradual rollout of an Intel-based set-top box that customers can control with their smarpthones. Called “X1,” the platform will rely on data centers packed with high-end servers — which typically also use Intel chips. Intel last year wound down a push to make chips specifically for “smart” TVs after Google TV, which it had backed, failed to make a major splash with consumers. At the same time, it formed the Intel Media business group with a mandate of promoting digital content on Intel-based platforms. According to sources, Intel is proposing to media companies a service could include both a bundle of TV channels similar to a normal cable package and an on-demand component. Intel is intent on launching its video service before the end of the year, sources said. Original plans called for it to be launched by November, said one of the sources, but that deadline likely will not be met. The biggest problem Intel faces is its inability to reach deals with major content providers, which are reluctant to license their networks and TV shows at rates that could undercut their larger established cable and satellite partners. Intel wants to keep its costs down by licensing smaller packages of TV networks instead of replicating the basic cable TV bundle of more than 100 channels. But network owners won’t agree to smaller bundles without being paid a premium for the channels they choose to license. “Why would I want you to take subscribers away from another distributor at a lower price?,” asked the same media executive who spoke with Reuters on condition of anonymity. To change that mindset, Intel has assembled a team of television industry veterans well-schooled in negotiating distribution deals. Leading the group as head of Intel Media is Erik Huggers, who worked on media at Microsoft before going to the BBC. Huggers enlisted as an adviser Garth Ancier, who most recently served as president for BBC Worldwide America and before that worked at NBC, FOX, and Disney.

276,INTC,INSIGHT-Intel's plans for virtual TV come into focus,"* Facial-recognition to serve up personalized ads * Media heavyweights to work with Intel * Plans call for year-end launch; still no content deals By Yinka Adegoke and Noel Randewich NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO, June 8 (Reuters) - Intel is counting on facial-recognition technology for targeted ads and a team of veteran entertainment dealmakers to win over reluctant media partners for its new virtual television service. But so far it’s proving a challenge to get the service off the ground, thanks to an unwillingness on the part of major media content providers to let Intel unbundle and license specific networks and shows at a discount to what cable and satellite partners pay. Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, has kept its strategy to launch a slimmed down cable TV service under wraps as the tech giant risks getting into a completely new line of business. According to five sources who have been negotiating with Intel for months, the company is emphasizing a set-top box employing Intel technology that can distinguish who is watching, potentially allowing Intel to target advertising. The set-top box pitched by Intel doesn’t identify specific people, but it could provide general data about viewers’ gender or whether they’re adults or children to help target advertising, two sources said. Intel’s plans put it in the middle of Silicon Valley’s battle for the living room. Heavyweights such as Apple, Amazon and Google believe the $100 billion U.S. cable television ecosystem - dominated by major distributors such as Comcast and DirecTV Group and program makers like Walt Disney Co and Time Warner Inc.  - is ripe for disruption for reasons ranging from shifting viewer habits to ever-increasing programming costs. While none of these companies have so far been able to make major inroads, Intel thinks it can build a better set-top box and over-the-top subscription service to deliver TV content to consumers, even though the initiative catapults it into virgin market territory. A successful TV service showcasing Intel technology could be a big step toward making its chips prevalent in more living room devices. “If they can create a virtual network and it incorporates proprietary Intel technology, they could certainly bring something different to the subscription TV model.” said JMP analyst Alex Gauna. Intel’s offering aims to exploit one of the TV industry’s major issues: the reliability, or lack thereof, of Nielsen ratings data on audiences. Nielsen has long been the dominant provider of TV ratings, but the accuracy of its data has come under attack by some network programmers, who argue that its polling system of 50,000 homes is antiquated for the digital age. For its part, Intel claims that the new interactive features in its set-top box would add greater value to TV advertising and help offset reduced revenue from licensing fees for network owners. “They’ve told us the technology is going to be so much more interactive with ads that you can make more money. But it’s just a little unproven,” said one executive who has been involved in the talks. An Intel representative declined to comment for this story. Chip features making it easier for Hollywood studios to protect content streamed to computers, as well as tools for detecting faces and analyzing audiences, are examples of current proprietary technology that Intel would like to see widely adopted. BEYOND PCs While Intel’s processors power 80 percent of the world’s PCs, its chips have not achieved a significant presence in smartphones, tablets and other interconnected devices. Intel executives say they are eager to make sure its semiconductors play major roles in new markets with big growth potential. According to a company source, ensuring that its chips become prevalent in home entertainment devices would be the driving reason behind any Internet TV service it launches. Comcast, for instance, recently announced the gradual rollout of an Intel-based set-top box that customers can control with their smarpthones. Called “X1,” the platform will rely on data centers packed with high-end servers — which typically also use Intel chips. Intel last year wound down a push to make chips specifically for “smart” TVs after Google TV, which it had backed, failed to make a major splash with consumers. At the same time, it formed the Intel Media business group with a mandate of promoting digital content on Intel-based platforms. According to sources, Intel is proposing to media companies a service could include both a bundle of TV channels similar to a normal cable package and an on-demand component. Intel is intent on launching its video service before the end of the year, sources said. Original plans called for it to be launched by November, said one of the sources, but that deadline likely will not be met. The biggest problem Intel faces is its inability to reach deals with major content providers, which are reluctant to license their networks and TV shows at rates that could undercut their larger established cable and satellite partners. Intel wants to keep its costs down by licensing smaller packages of TV networks instead of replicating the basic cable TV bundle of more than 100 channels. But network owners won’t agree to smaller bundles without being paid a premium for the channels they choose to license. “Why would I want you to take subscribers away from another distributor at a lower price?,” asked the same media executive who spoke with Reuters on condition of anonymity. To change that mindset, Intel has assembled a team of television industry veterans well-schooled in negotiating distribution deals. Leading the group as head of Intel Media is Erik Huggers, who worked on media at Microsoft before going to the BBC. Huggers enlisted as an adviser Garth Ancier, who most recently served as president for BBC Worldwide America and before that worked at NBC, FOX, and Disney. In addition to Huggers and Ancier, sources said, two other names prominent in TV circles have emerged as consultants for Intel: entertainment lawyer Ken Ziffren and former MTV executive Nicole Browning. Browning, who previously negotiated on the other side of the table for MTV, has been handling some of the talks with partners, sources said. Ziffren built his reputation representing Hollywood talent - he was instrumental in negotiating the deal that returned the “Tonight Show” to Jay Leno.

277,INTC,"Analysis: Stakes high as ""Wintel"" puts all its chips on Windows 8","TAIPEI (Reuters) - The world of Wintel - Microsoft, Intel and the Taiwan-based companies that build the computers their products power and run on - is taking a huge collective bet on Windows 8. And while this week’s Computex trade show in Taiwan has largely presented a united front, it has also highlighted some of the tensions that big gamble has created in a once tight relationship between the U.S. firms and their Asian partners. At stake is the future of the world’s largest software developer, whose new operating system is expected to be launched in the fourth quarter, and it largest chip maker, as well as an island-wide industry of computer makers and parts suppliers. In one corner you have Microsoft Corp, which is porting its tiled Metro interface used in Windows Phone to tablets, laptops and the desktop. Although the old point and click interface is still available, the focus is on a touch screen that pits Windows against Google Inc’s Android and Apple Inc’s iOS. In another corner you have chip maker Intel Corp, long Microsoft’s partner in personal computers. Intel has not only seen its position slip as the world shifts to mobile devices, it has also had to make room beside Microsoft for Britain’s ARM Holdings Plc, whose mobile-friendly chips may be better suited for tablets running Windows 8. And then there are the computer manufacturers themselves, most of whom are based in Taiwan and who are struggling to combine Microsoft’s new operating system and Intel’s chip-based designs into products that sell - and turn them a profit. The Computex show that ended at the weekend has illustrated just how delicate this arrangement is - with differences over pricing, promotion and the ecosystem that will be needed to support this new chapter in Windows’ history. “Is this going to be a major resurrection? Well, at least it’ll help stop tablets from cannibalizing the PC laptop sector,” said Jonah Cheng, an analyst with UBS. Microsoft, though still strong on conventional PCs, has watched the energy and innovation shift to mobile devices - led by Apple’s iPhone and iPad. While PC shipments fell 1.4 percent last year, and are expected to grow by only 4.4 percent this year, according to research firm Gartner, tablet shipments have grown from 19.4 million units in 2010 to 68.4 million last year, with that figure expected to rise by 85 percent this year, according to rival IHS. Of those tablets expected to sold this year, Gartner estimates more than 60 percent will be iPads - and only 4 percent of them will be running Microsoft’s operating system. Microsoft, therefore, has little choice but to overhaul Windows to straddle both its traditional computer market and the world of tablets. The result is a potentially jarring shift for users long comfortable with the familiar Windows interface. Intel, for its part, is having to rethink its chip business, which has focused on processing data rather than more mobile-centric issues such as power consumption. In the meantime, however, it is pushing its vision of a slimmed down laptop called the Ultrabook. The first round of such devices - which owe a lot in look and feel to Apple’s successful MacBook Air - were not a huge success, but Intel has come up with better chips, materials and designs featuring sliding, folding or detachable keyboards that it hopes will blur the lines between laptop and tablet. All of this, however, depends on the computer manufacturers and suppliers themselves. It’s they who have to build the devices and figure out how to turn a profit. This creates its own internal tensions because Microsoft wants each Windows machine to leverage all its features as much as possible, while the original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, as Taiwan’s gearmakers are known in the industry, have traditionally cut corners to keep prices low. “Microsoft will live and die on how well the OEMs implement the features of Windows 8,” says Forrester principal analyst Frank Gillett. Intel, too, is trying to push the OEMs to add touch screens and other whizz-bang features to help to push the Ultrabook up-market and differentiate it from the MacBook Air. Intel has even gone so far as to sign agreements with touchscreen suppliers undertaking to buy up excess capacity to ensure there are adequate supplies for the OEMs, who make much of the world’s computer hardware for global vendors and, increasingly, their own brands. The result is that Intel is emphasising quality and features that may push the price of such devices above the sensitive $1,000 mark. A touch screen, for example, adds roughly $100 to the cost of an Ultrabook, Forrester’s Gillett says. Intel defends the creeping rise in cost, arguing that while it could easily offer designs for much cheaper models it believes the market is looking for more sophisticated devices. “We can specify the Ultrabook to get the price point all the way down to $399, but we don’t think that’s what the consumers want,” said Intel senior vice president Tom Kilroy. The Computex show-floor reflected this diversity and ambition. Asustek’s Taichi dual screen Ultrabook - where both sides of the lid sport a screen - was a particular draw. And although most manufacturers appeared to have embraced the full range of Intel’s suggested designs and Windows 8’s features, the quality remained uneven. The plastic slider on one device, for example, failed to unhinge the tablet from the keyboard. Some models remained encased in glass boxes, suggesting they were some way from completion. While Computex was show time for Windows 8 and the devices running the system, there is still some way to go until the software’s launch. And there are plenty of issues still to hammer out. First is who pays whom for what, and how much. The manufacturers must pay Microsoft for each copy of Windows and Intel for each chip. While these account for about a third of an Ultrabook’s bill of materials, Forrester’s Gillett says that’s where the greatest margins are. Analyst Serene Chan of Frost and Sullivan said that Microsoft plans to charge $100 for each Windows 8 licence - a significant increase over what it charged for Windows 7 running on mobile devices, especially when compared with Google’s Android operating system, which manufacturers can use for free. “The cost of the licence that OEMs have to pay Microsoft will be a major drawback,” she said. Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment on pricing. Manufacturers said they still hoped to persuade Microsoft to reduce licence fees. Said one executive from a PC vendor: “We are a major player in the market and hopefully that gives us more negotiating power on the royalty fees and cross payments.” Intel said that while its price list was public, its arrangements with individual clients were confidential. But Intel’s Kilroy was defiant, saying that the company invests tens of billions of dollars in chip manufacturing, and a similar amount in research and development. “So we don’t apologise for the fact that we are the leading edge technology, and that we expect to get paid for it,” he said. “The business model works very well.” Still, as the ground has shifted towards a tighter ecosystem that embraces developers, cloud services, content and - at least in the case of Apple - a combined maker of hardware, operating system developer and retailer, Taiwan’s manufacturers must pray that Microsoft and Intel help to fill in the gaps in the Windows world, which now looks a little out of date. Can, for example, Microsoft build an ecosystem of application developers and payments as attractive as those of Google, Amazon and Apple? Microsoft has launched its own version of Apple’s app store, but it’s not yet clear how it will work for those programmes that don’t use the Metro interface. “They have to make it very easy for people to develop, test and then market Metro-style applications,” says Richard Edwards, London-based analyst for IT consultants Ovum. Whether these products do well once they are launched is going to be largely down to how well they are promoted. As the devices, whether tablets, Ultrabooks or hybrids of the two, are likely to be aimed at more well-heeled customers than these manufacturers are used to, promotion is going to be key. And that, in turn, mostly falls to Microsoft and Intel. Having built the devices, the manufacturers will rely on the U.S. giants’ marketing clout to convince users to buy them. Outspoken Acer chairman J.T. Wang, for example, told reporters at Computex how he had recently made his concerns about this clear to Microsoft’s CEO. “When I was in Seattle last month I told Steve Ballmer that they’ll have to come up with a strong marketing campaign.” Ballmer’s response, Wang said, was to point out that he’d just been named worst CEO of 2011 by Forbes. “Although you are the worst CEO of 2011,” Wang says he told him, “you have to stand up and fight.” Ballmer, Wang recalled, said Microsoft would fight. It’s likely they will. But another fly in the ointment is a shift in the old alliance between Intel and Microsoft. Computex 2012 marked a divergence of interests as Microsoft is now also working closely with ARM, offering a version of Windows 8 called Windows RT that will work on its less power-hungry processors in tablet devices. There were few of these devices to be found at Computex. These will come later, but there are already concerns that Taiwan-based manufacturers, who do not have a long or particularly successful track record building tablets, are likely to face increasing price pressure. Highlighting the challenge, British-based research company IMS Research said on Friday that Apple’s competitive pricing has helped push the average price of tablets down by 21 percent in a single year.

281,INTC,ARM says Intel is no threat in smartphones,"LONDON (Reuters) - Chip designer ARM ARM.L said its rival Intel Corp (INTC.O) had made a credible debut in smartphones, but the British company’s better technology and the size of its partner network meant it would remain dominant in the hot sector. Nearly all smartphones and tablets, including Apple’s (AAPL.O) iPhone and iPad and Samsung’s (005930.KS) Galaxy S3, use processors based on ARM’s energy-efficient architecture. Intel, in turn, dominates the PC market, helped in no small part by Microsoft (MSFT.O) basing Windows on its x86 architecture, but its chips have failed to make inroads in mobile where battery life is critical. The U.S. company hopes that will change with the recent launch of handsets in China, India and last week in Europe, based on its Atom processor and backed by operator Orange FTE.PA. Warren East, chief executive of Cambridge-based ARM, said Intel’s phones were still a couple of generations behind the latest ARM-based smartphones. “I’ve played with the (Indian) phone and it’s a very good phone,” East told the Reuters Media and Technology Summit. “It’s very comparable with the Apple 3G (launched in 2008) in terms of browsing speed, and ease of user interface and so on.” But he did not perceive Intel “as a huge threat”. “We’ve been saying Intel will gain some share in the smartphone space,” he said in London. “However, we think it will be not be vast because they will be one of 20 companies supplying into that space, the others have the advantage of using the ARM architecture, and the last 10-15 years has been spent developing a very strong ecosystem around that architecture.” He said Intel were catching up in making microprocessors more efficient, but the ARM world continued to move ahead. East said ARM was working on the assumption that Intel would gain about 10 percent of the smartphone apps processor market in two to four years. “In a few years time, it will settle out at some number but we do not think it’s going to be much bigger than that,” he said. ARM’s blueprints are licensed to chipmakers, such as Samsung and Qualcomm (QCOM.O), which in turn pay a small royalty of 1-2 percent of the shipping price per chip. Electronics manufacturers and software designers also license the British firm’s technology, with the result that development costs are spread across the industry. While Intel could gain ground in smartphones, ARM is moving in the other direction into Intel’s territory. Later this year, PCs based on ARM’s architecture will launch, a milestone enabled by Microsoft (MSFT.O) configuring its Windows operating system for ARM’s architecture for the first time, enabling it to capture a chunk of the tablet market. East said an added benefit of Microsoft’s decision was that it opened the PC market up to ARM architecture. “We don’t see why in due course we shouldn’t have a large share (of the PC market),” he said. “We are anticipating 10 percent, probably 20 percent in a few years, but why we should be able to go further is the business model. “In the ARM world you have 20 or so companies supplying apps processors into smartphones at the moment, and PC and smartphone functionality is becoming increasing similar: the chips are basically the same chips.” He said the launch later this year would be fairly muted, with around half a dozen products initially on sale. “I think for the launch and 2012, the important thing is proving the concept,” he said. “But Microsoft has a fantastic track record: virtually every PC on the planet is running Windows and I have no reason to doubt they won’t be able to do the same thing with an ARM-based version.” ",6122012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-media-tech-summit-arm/arm-says-intel-is-no-threat-in-smartphones-idUSBRE85B0C320120612
282,INTC,Intel CFO eyes more connected living rooms,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New markets including home entertainment will be major sources of growth for Intel Corp as more gadgets become connected to the Internet and drive demand for powerful data centers, the top chipmaker’s chief financial officer said. While Intel is eager to sell processors for smartphones, set-top boxes and other connected devices, in many cases the much more expensive chips for servers that are needed to stream movies and other content are a bigger business opportunity, CFO Stacy Smith told the Reuters Media and Technology Summit in New York. “It’s probably true in the digital TV space because if you think about it, the content that is going to be served to these devices is extraordinary,” he said on Wednesday. “It’s increasingly high-def digital content, so it’s got to be driving a pretty significant buildout of the storage infrastructure and server infrastructure that supports all those devices.” The opportunity is not limited to home entertainment. Digital signs, tablets and cars are among other areas increasingly connected to the Internet, fueling demand for more Intel chips, he said. Smith’s comments come as Intel puts together a TV service that includes a set-top box employing technology that can distinguish who is watching, potentially allowing Intel to target advertising, according to sources. Smith would not discuss Intel’s specific plans for the TV service. Asked about entertainment industry veterans who have been advising Intel, Smith said, “We hire smart people from a variety of industries that give us insight into industries and they give us capabilities we haven’t historically had.” Intel already makes processors for set-top boxes. Comcast, for instance, recently announced the gradual rollout of an Intel-based set-top box that customers can control with their smartphones. Called “X1,” the platform will rely on data centers packed with high-end servers — which typically also use Intel chips. Intel’s processors power 80 percent of the world’s PCs but growth in that market has been slowing as more consumers turn to tablets. A sovereign debt crisis has shaken investor and consumer confidence in Europe, forcing Cisco and other major technology companies to scale back expectations for IT spending there. Last month, Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini played down those concerns and said the quarter was playing out as expected. Smith emphasized China and other markets where PC sales are growing faster than in developed markets, saying a weak Europe is a “baseline” presumption for Intel.

283,INTC,UPDATE 1-Microsoft announces Surface tablet,"* Software company launches own ‘Surface’ tablet * Two versions: one runs Intel, one ARM * No pricing, release date details By Lisa Richwine LOS ANGELES, June 18 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp  unveiled a tablet called Surface on Monday, in a move to rival Apple Inc’s massively successful iPad. The world’s largest software maker is on track to launch its touch-friendly Windows 8 operating system this autumn and wants to make a big impact with its own device to kickstart demand. The tablet will come in two versions, one running on traditional Intel Corp chips, and another using ARM Holdings. Both will have a fold-out cover that becomes a keyboard. A prototype was demonstrated by Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer at an event in Los Angeles. The tablets will be available when Windows 8 ships later this year, according to a Microsoft statement. No details on pricing were mentioned, except that it would be “comparable” with current ARM tablets and Intel-powered Ultrabooks. Microsoft shares rose slightly in after-hours trading. They closed down 0.6 percent at $29.84 in the regular Nasdaq session. Launching its own tablet potentially throws Microsoft into direct competition with its closest hardware partners such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Hewlett-Packard Co . Sales of tablets are expected to triple in the next two years, topping 180 million a year in 2013, easily outpacing growth in traditional PCs. Apple has sold 67 million iPads in two years since launch. Apple, which makes both hardware and software for greater control over the performance of the final product, has revolutionized mobile markets with its smooth, seamless phones and tablets. Rival Google Inc may experiment with a similar approach after buying phone maker Motorola Mobility this year.",6182012,http://www.reuters.com/article/microsoft-windows-tablets/update-1-microsoft-announces-surface-tablet-idUSL1E8HIFRD20120618
284,INTC,Intel to buy InterDigital patents for $375 million,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - InterDigital Inc said on Monday it had agreed to sell to Intel Corp about 1,700 wireless technology patents for $375 million, sending InterDigital shares up 27 percent. While Intel is pushing to expand its chip business beyond computers and into mobile devices, InterDigital for about a year has been seeking to capitalize on a surge in interest in wireless patents. InterDigital investors applauded the deal on Monday after some had questioned the company’s ability to finalize a patent sale after the company said in January that it had failed to find a buyer for the whole company but would keep looking for buyers for its patent portfolio. In July 2011, InterDigital said it was looking into a possible sale of the company or its patents in the hope that other big patent deals would boost its value. “This should reduce some of the executional overhang that was on the stock. The market was worried they wouldn’t meet this milestone,” said M Partners analyst Ron Shuttleworth. “They lost a lot of credibility once they had to cancel the process.” However, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said that the $220,000 price per patent that Intel agreed to pay appeared to be much lower than previously announced patent deals. In comparison, Rasgon cited Nortel’s $4.5 billion patent sale last year that fetched $750,000 per patent and Google Inc’s recent $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola Mobility, which implies a price of more than $735,000 per patent assuming a zero valuation for its cellphone hardware business. Rasgon said that the deal should fit well with Intel’s mobile strategy. “While we believe these new patents acquired from Interdigital should further bolster their position, we do not expect any changes to their wireless strategy as a result of the purchase,” Rasgon said in a research note. InterDigital also announced on Monday that its board had authorized a doubling of its share buyback authorization to $200 million from $100 million. It also said it was sticking by its revenue target of $71 million for the second quarter, including the sale of other patents for $9 million in a separate deal. The companies expect the deal to close in the third quarter. Evercore Partners acted as InterDigital financial adviser and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich 7 Rosati acted as legal counsel.

The European Commission penalised the world’s No.1 chipmaker three years ago for hindering arch-rival Advanced Micro Devices, after an eight-year investigation. The fine, which represented 4.15 percent of Intel’s 2008 turnover versus a possible maximum of 10 percent, was the biggest ever levied on a company. A panel of five judges at the General Court in Luxembourg, Europe’s second highest, will hear arguments from both the EU watchdog and Intel during the four-day hearing, in which the company wants its conviction and fine thrown out or reduced. The Commission did not have sufficient evidence of any wrongdoing by Intel and relied too much on subjective comments by the company’s customers, Intel’s lawyer Nicholas Green told the court. “The quality of evidence relied on by the Commission is profoundly inadequate. The analysis is hopelessly and irretrievably defective,” he said. “The Commission’s case turns on what customers’ subjective understanding is,” Green said. U.S. No.2 PC maker Dell Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co, Japan’s NEC, world No.2 PC maker Lenovo and German retail chain Media Saturn Holding received rebates from Intel during the period investigated by the regulator. Lawyers for the Commission said this was at the core of Intel’s illegal business practice. “These kind of rebates can only be intended to tie customers and put competitors in an unfavourable position,” Commission lawyer Nicholas Khan told judges.

289,INTC,"Intel funds next-gen chipmaking, buys into ASML for $4.1 billion","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp will spend more than $4 billion to buy a stake in ASML and bankroll its research into costly next-generation chipmaking technology, a major vote of confidence in the Dutch company that sent its U.S. shares soaring 6 percent on Monday. Intel hopes to speed the adoption of the next generation of chip manufacturing processes from ASML by as much as two years. That will require intensive capital investment, but delivers billions of savings in future, analysts said. ASML, the world’s largest maker of machines that etch circuits onto silicon wafers and a barometer for the chip sector, may want to spread the risk of developing cutting-edge chipmaking equipment, based on 450-millimeter wafer sizes and “extreme-ultraviolet” or EUV lithography. Intel will acquire an initial 10 percent stake in its European supplier and add another 5 percent pending shareholders’ approval, for a total of about $3.1 billion. It also benefits by being able to move on to larger wafer sizes. “The transition from one wafer size to the next has historically delivered a 30 to 40 percent reduction in die cost,” Chief Operating Officer Brian Krzanich said in a statement. “The faster we do this, the sooner we can gain the benefit of productivity improvements.” RBC Capital analyst Doug Freedman estimates Intel can save about $2 billion a year on 450mm processes, versus the current standard of 300mm. Larger silicon wafers lower production costs because more chips can be sliced off them. Under the agreement, Intel gains no exclusive rights to future ASML products. But Freedman said Intel, as the sector leader, stands to gain if the overall industry benefits. “I was a little surprised that ASML did not offer exclusivity or preferential access,” Freedman said. But “if in fact they’re lowering the cost of technology in emerging markets, you’re opening markets as well.” Intel and other chipmakers are grappling with slowing demand as consumers shift to mobile devices, and economic growth in Europe and even emerging markets is weakening. On Monday, Advanced Micro Devices warned its second-quarter revenue may slide 11 percent, blaming disappointing demand from China and Europe. A shift to cutting-edge EUV helps also push the natural progression of semiconductor technology advancement known as “Moore’s Law”, which posits that the average number of transistors packed on a chip doubles every 18 months. The world’s top chipmaker will also help finance $1 billion of research into 450mm and extreme-ultraviolet chipmaking, both cutting-edge technologies that had been expected to emerge in the decade’s second half. While many semiconductor companies outsource the fabrication of actual chips to third-party “foundries,” Intel is among the last remaining chipmakers that build and operate their own network of multibillion dollar production facilities, or “fabs”. “If Intel is able to ramp 450mm production ahead of the world’s fabs such as TSMC or Global Foundries et al, it may yet prove that real men have fabs,” said John Jackson from CCS Insight. “There are signs that the global semiconductor fabrication sector is poised to realign.” Intel is the first major chipmaker to sign up for ASML’s “customer investment” program, under which it hopes to enlist partners to fund expensive research into 450mm wafer technology, a more economical chipmaking process. Under their agreement, Intel will pay 1.7 billion euros ($2.1 billion) for the initial 10 percent slice of ASML, and a preliminary 553 million euros for research. The pact also involves advance orders of next-generation ASML chipmaking gear, strengthening the Dutch firm’s assurance to move ahead in developing the technology.

(unrated) over the next five years to accelerate the development of advanced manufacturing tool technologies totaling $4.1 billion (EUR3.3 billion).    Intel’s funding commitment is structured through two phases: the first,  related to R&D; investments of $680 million (EUR553 million) over five years to  assist ASML develop 450mm wafer manufacturing tools, as well as an equity  investment of $2.1 billion (EUR1.7 billion) for about 10% of ASML’s shares; the  second, subject to ASML shareholder approval, is related to additional R&D;  investments of $340 million (EUR276 million) to accelerate extreme ultraviolet  (UAV) lithography and an equity investment of $1 billion (EUR 838 million) for  an additional 5% of ASML. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory  approvals and approval of ASML’s stockholders for the second following on  investment.  Intel intends to finance the R&D; and equity investments in ASML from its  overseas cash balances. Intel has robust cash and short-term investments of  nearly $14 billion as of March 2012 and strong free operating cash flow. We  believe Intel’s investments in ASML will accelerate the deployment of  next-generation wafer technology and advanced lithography, allowing Intel to  maintain its lead in wafer manufacturing technologies.  The ratings on Intel reflect the company’s strong leadership position in the  microprocessor industry, its consistently high profit margins, and its deep  financial cushion.

295,INTC,ASML wins funds for chip technology from Intel,"SAN FRANCISCO/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - ASML, the world’s top chip equipment maker, signed up Intel Corp to bankroll its research into costly next-generation chipmaking technology, and aims to reach similar deals with TSMC and Samsung Electronics. ASML’s chief executive said on Tuesday the Dutch firm had asked its three  biggest customers - Intel, TSMC, and Samsung Electronics - to help fund its R&D; in exchange for up to 25 percent of its shares. Following Intel’s decision, it expects to announce more customer investments in the coming weeks. ASML shares rose 10 percent on the news. Intel fell about 1 percent after hours. Fast-tracking the development of such technology not only cements ASML’s position as the market leader ahead of Nikon, but could also slash production costs for hot consumer gadgets such as smartphones and tablet computers. “We’re talking about $50 tablets” said Richard Windsor, Nomura’s global technology specialist. “This brings into the realms of possibility a technology that we thought wasn’t feasible and opens up the possibility for greater cost reductions”. Intel said on Monday it would spend more than $4 billion to buy up to 15 percent of ASML and fund its research. TSMC said it was considering a similar deal. Intel hopes to speed up the adoption of the next generation of chip manufacturing processes from ASML by as much as two years. That will require huge capital investment, but would deliver billions of savings by cutting chip production costs. ASML, the world’s largest supplier to chipmakers of machines that etch circuits onto silicon wafers, wants to spread the risk of developing cutting-edge equipment based on 450-millimeter wafer sizes and “extreme-ultraviolet” or EUV lithography. Under the terms of the deal, Intel will invest $1 billion in research into those two technologies, which are expected to emerge in the next few years. It will also acquire an initial 10 percent stake in ASML and tack on another 5 percent if it wins shareholder approval, for a total of about $3.1 billion. Analysts said the deal would help cement ASML’s market leading position, save money, safeguard its technology lead, and make it harder for smaller competitors to keep going. Shares in rival Nikon, which also researches and develops lithography processes, fell 7 percent on the news. A spokesman said Nikon “would like to continue our cooperation with Intel going forward”. “In a bold move to bring heavy investment into its future development needs, tie in large customers and damage any Nikon ambitions in EUV, ASML has delivered a strong message of strategic intent for the next semi cycle and beyond,” Jeffries International research said in a note. Intel and other chipmakers are grappling with slowing demand as consumers shift to mobile devices, and economic growth in Europe and even emerging markets is weakening. On Monday, Advanced Micro Devices warned its second-quarter revenue may slide 11 percent, blaming disappointing demand from China and Europe. RBC Capital analyst Doug Freedman said Intel could save about $2 billion a year on 450mm processes, versus the current standard of 300mm. Larger silicon wafers lower production costs because more chips can be sliced off them. “The transition from one wafer size to the next has historically delivered a 30 to 40 percent reduction in die cost,” Intel Chief Operating Officer Brian Krzanich said in a statement. “The faster we do this, the sooner we can gain the benefit of productivity improvements.” Intel, the world’s top chipmaker, gains no exclusive rights to ASML products in the deal. But Freedman said Intel stood to gain if the overall industry benefited and by lowering the cost of technology in emerging markets would open new markets.

296,INTC,"AMD slides as weak Europe, China prompts outlook cut","(Reuters) - Shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc fell as much as 9 percent in early trading after the chipmaker slashed its sales outlook, prompting a slew of brokerages to cut their price targets on the stock. AMD and other chipmakers are grappling with slowing demand, as consumers shift to mobile devices and economic growth weakens in Europe and emerging markets. Chip gear maker Applied Materials Inc also cut its full-year sales outlook on Tuesday morning, sending its shares down 6 percent on the Nasdaq. The companies joined software firms Qlik Technologies Inc and Informatica Corp in issuing estimates below market forecasts — an early indication of potentially weak results from tech companies this earnings season. AMD said on Monday second-quarter revenue may slide 11 percent from the first quarter, reflecting disappointing sales in Europe and China. The company, which faces competition from Intel Corp’s newest personal computer chip — code-named Ivy Bridge — will likely remain under pressure due to its low market share and Intel’s superior products, J.P. Morgan said in a client note. Intel said in April that Ivy Bridge would drive sales later this year and power a new crop of super-thin laptops dubbed “ultrabooks.” “We suspect second quarter marks the worst quarter of the year (for AMD), exacerbated by the impact of Intel’s Ivy Bridge launch,” Citigroup analysts said. The analysts said they do not expect Intel to miss estimates when it reports next week. Intel on Monday said it would spend more than $4 billion to buy up to 15 percent Dutch chip-gear maker ASML Holding NV and fund its research into costly next-generation chipmaking technology. AMD’s shares, which have lost 40 percent of their value after touching a year-high in March, were trading down 8 percent at $5.16 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock was among the biggest percentage losers on the exchange on Tuesday morning.

297,INTC,Banks aid European shares rally on ESM talk,"* FTSEurofirst up 1.2 percent * Banks rally on ESM rumours * Sodexo falls after Q3 update * ASML rallies as Intel takes stake By David Brett LONDON, July 10 (Reuters) - Riskier banking assets rose as European shares were squeezed higher on Tuesday on speculation that Germany’s constitutional court would give its blessing to Europe’s new bailout fund, which could pave the way for the fund to be used more flexibly. In extremely choppy and light trade the FTSEurofirst  was up 12.14 points, or 1.2 percent at 1,042.23, by 1043 GMT although volumes were just 27 percent of their 90-day average, reflecting the broader uncertainty preventing investors from pumping fresh cash into such a tumultuous market. After a bullish start to the second half of 2012 when the FTSEurofirst gained more than 5 percent over three trading days fueled by expectations of central bank intervention to help boost flagging global growth, the rally has petered out around 1,050. That level is technically significant as the 61.8 retracement of a fall which began in March - when euro sovereign debt worries resurfaced - and bottomed out at the beginning of June, as expectations of central bank intervention grew. The index is range bound in the short-term seeing solid support around 1,030. Grabbing investors’ attention on Tuesday was a  meeting of Germany’s top court to address whether Europe’s new bailout fund, the ESM, and budget rules are compatible with national law. The German parliament approved the ESM in June, but the court hearing is expected to take some time, keeping Europe on tenterhooks. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told the court that a big delay to the ESM could cause uncertainty on markets and a loss of confidence in the EU’s ability to make decisions. “It would be incrementally positive if the German court approved it and if they didn’t, then it would not be great for the markets,” said an analyst at a large London-based brokerage. Banks, which would be the major beneficiary if the fund were to be approved, rallied along with other risk assets as investors bought in on the beaten down lenders. The sector trades on a price to book value of just 0.6 times, according to Thomson Reuters data, but the London-based analyst is cautious on the banking sector in the longer term citing clarity issues in the face of regulation uncertainty, lending constraints and balance sheet strength, which is weighing on their outlook. A euro zone finance ministers’ decision to grant Spain an extra year to reach its deficit reduction targets and set the parameters of an aid package for Madrid’s ailing banks was broadly as expected, and also helped set a more bullish tone. As uncertainty lingers over most sectors, the upcoming quarterly earnings season is expected to show the impact volatile trading conditions in Europe is having on corporates with European company profits forecasts to shrink by 9 percent compared with a 4.5 percent expansion in the United States, according to Thomson Reuters Starmine data. Aluminium producer Alcoa started the earnings season in the U.S. by posting a second-quarter loss overnight, but results, excluding one-off items, beat Wall Street estimates. Highlighting just how tough it is for companies in the current macro economic environment in Europe, French catering-to-vouchers group Sodexo shed 5.5 percent after it said growth slowed in the third quarter as corporate clients reduced spending across Europe, although it kept its full-year targets. UK peer Compass Group slipped 2.5 percent. Bellwether British retailer Marks & Spencer echoed Sodexo’s sentiment as it posted its worst underlying quarterly sales performance for three and a half years. Marks & Spencer shares, however, rose 2.2 percent, having been shorted in advance, according to data from Markit. Elsewhere on the upside, ASML Holding jumped 8.8 percent after Intel Corp said it would spend more than $4 billion to buy up to 15 percent of ASML and bankroll the Dutch company’s research into costly next-generation chipmaking technology, a major vote of confidence in the European firm. UK chipmaker and Intel rival ARM Holdings ARM.L fell 1.8 percent. ",7102012,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-europe-stocks/banks-aid-european-shares-rally-on-esm-talk-idUSL6E8IA5M020120710
298,INTC,UPDATE 4-ASML wins funds for chip technology from Intel,"* ASML shares surge 10 pct in Amsterdam * Intel’s $4.1 bln spending includes R&D;, stake buy * Intel first to sign onto ASML investment program * ASML talking to TSMC, Samsung Electronics about similar deals   (Recasts, add talks with TSMC, Samsung Electronics) By Edwin Chan and Sara Webb SAN FRANCISCO/AMSTERDAM, July 10 (Reuters) - ASML, the world’s top chip equipment maker, signed up Intel Corp  to bankroll its research into costly next-generation chipmaking technology, and aims to reach similar deals with TSMC  and Samsung Electronics. ASML’s chief executive said on Tuesday the Dutch firm had asked its three three biggest customers - Intel, TSMC, and Samsung Electronics - to help fund its R&D; in exchange for up to 25 percent of its shares. Following Intel’s decision, it expects to announce more customer investments in the coming weeks. ASML shares rose 10 percent on the news. Intel fell about 1 percent after hours. Fast-tracking the development of such technology not only cements ASML’s position as the market leader ahead of Nikon , but could also slash production costs for hot consumer gadgets such as smartphones and tablet computers. “We’re talking about $50 tablets” said Richard Windsor, Nomura’s global technology specialist. “This brings into the realms of possibility a technology that we thought wasn’t feasible and opens up the possibility for greater cost reductions”. Intel said on Monday it would spend more than $4 billion to buy up to 15 percent of ASML and fund its research. TSMC said it was considering a similar deal. Intel hopes to speed up the adoption of the next generation of chip manufacturing processes from ASML by as much as two years. That will require huge capital investment, but would deliver billions of savings by cutting chip production costs. ASML, the world’s largest supplier to chipmakers of machines that etch circuits onto silicon wafers, wants to spread the risk of developing cutting-edge equipment based on 450-millimeter wafer sizes and “extreme-ultraviolet” or EUV lithography. Under the terms of the deal, Intel will invest $1 billion in research into those two technologies, which are expected to emerge in the next few years. It will also acquire an initial 10 percent stake in ASML and tack on another 5 percent if it wins shareholder approval, for a total of about $3.1 billion. Analysts said the deal would help cement ASML’s market leading position, save money, safeguard its technology lead, and make it harder for smaller competitors to keep going. Shares in rival Nikon, which also researches and develops lithography processes, fell 7 percent on the news. A spokesman said Nikon “would like to continue our cooperation with Intel going forward”. “In a bold move to bring heavy investment into its future development needs, tie in large customers and damage any Nikon ambitions in EUV, ASML has delivered a strong message of strategic intent for the next semi cycle and beyond,” Jeffries International research said in a note. Intel and other chipmakers are grappling with slowing demand as consumers shift to mobile devices, and economic growth in Europe and even emerging markets is weakening. On Monday, Advanced Micro Devices warned its second-quarter revenue may slide 11 percent, blaming disappointing demand from China and Europe. RBC Capital analyst Doug Freedman said Intel could save about $2 billion a year on 450mm processes, versus the current standard of 300mm. Larger silicon wafers lower production costs because more chips can be sliced off them. “The transition from one wafer size to the next has historically delivered a 30 to 40 percent reduction in die cost,” Intel Chief Operating Officer Brian Krzanich said in a statement. “The faster we do this, the sooner we can gain the benefit of productivity improvements.” Intel, the world’s top chipmaker, gains no exclusive rights to ASML products in the deal. But Freedman said Intel stood to gain if the overall industry benefited and by lowering the cost of technology in emerging markets would open new markets. Intel remains at the vanguard of computer processors but is seeing rivals like Samsung Electronics come on strong in application of microchips for smartphones and other mobile devices. Analysts say the U.S. company maintains a two-year lead over the competition but needs to spend heavily to safeguard that.

299,INTC,Nikon slips as Intel's ASML deals spurs profit worry,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Shares in Nikon Corp (7731.T) slipped on Tuesday as investors worried that Intel Corp’s (INTC.O) plan to invest in ASML (ASML.AS) (ASML.O) may hurt profits at the Japanese company, which vies with ASML to sell semiconductor production equipment to the U.S. chipmaker.

Nikon, ASML’s main rival, currently ships about half its scanners output to Intel, analysts estimate. The impact of Intel favoring equipment built by ASML would not be immediate, but could begin to show up in results as the next generation of etching equipment is introduced over the next couple of years, an analyst told Reuters, on condition he was not identified. Chipmaking equipment accounts for around one-tenth of sales at the Japanese company, which is better known for its cameras.

302,INTC,Intel forecast portends weak PC sales,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Top chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) reduced its growth forecast, reinforcing fears that a wavering global economy and a lack of consumer interest are dampening personal computer sales. Shaky economies in Europe and the United States and a growing consumer preference for Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) iPad tablets have been taking a toll on the PC industry. The world’s leading chipmaker on Tuesday cut its 2012 revenue growth forecast to between 3 and 5 percent, down from a prior forecast of “high single-digit growth.” That put Intel’s outlook in line with many investors’ recently reduced expectations and helped cushion a sell-off of its stock. “As macro events have transpired in the second quarter, people looked at the original high single-digit guidance as being stretched,” said Craig Ellis, an analyst at Caris & Company. “The Street would have been concerned had they stuck with that guidance - but they didn’t.” Fears that global PC sales may be worse than expected have helped push Intel’s shares down about 10 percent since the end of April. Intel’s stock has recently traded around 10 times expected earnings. Intel Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said consumer spending in Europe and the United States is softer than previously thought. “At the beginning of the year we would have expected, along with most economists, that economic growth would start picking up and that would lead to an increase in consumer sales. Those expectations are now more muted,” Smith said in an interview after Intel posted its second-quarter earnings. Revenue rose to $13.5 billion from $13.03 billion in the year-ago period, but fell short of the $13.56 billion expected. Intel forecast current-quarter revenue of $14.3 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts on average had expected $14.60 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. GAAP net income fell to $2.8 billion from $2.95 billion in the year-ago period. GAAP earnings per share were 54 cents, below analysts’ average forecast of 52 cents. Intel’s report came after its smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices AMD.N last week slashed its outlook for second-quarter revenue on disappointing sales in Europe and China, where economic growth has recently lost some steam. China and other emerging markets have been a key source of growth in recent quarters for chipmakers Intel and AMD, and PC manufacturers like Lenovo (0992.HK) and Acer (0992.HK), helping make up for weakness in the Europe and the United States. “Emerging markets, especially China and Brazil, are still growing nicely but are moderating due to GDP adjustments and currency fluctuations,” Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini told analysts on a conference call. Smith said global enterprise IT spending was expanding as expected, more due to the buildout of data centers powering the Internet than tech infrastructure upgrades by banks or other corporations. Doug Freedman, an analyst at RBC, said Intel’s forecast for the current quarter was less than typical for this time of year. “Normal seasonal PC demand would show Q3 growth of at least 9 to 10 percent and Intel’s guidance is comfortably below that,” he said. Intel supplies processors for 80 percent of the world’s PCs but it has yet to make significant progress in fast-growing tablets or smartphones, products that use chips based on technology from British-based ARM Holdings ARM.L. While the tablet market is still small, demand for the devices is growing much more quickly than for PCs. Shipments of tablets including Apple’s iPad are expected to grow 90 percent this year, according to IHS iSuppli. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS), Texas Instruments Inc (TXN.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) make many of the power-efficient processors used in tablets and smartphones. Intel is heavily promoting a new category of “Ultrabook” laptops with premium features like solid-state drives that it hopes will add some zest to a PC market that some see as lackluster compared to tablets and smartphones. Many analysts are concerned that touch screens and other high-end features on upcoming Ultrabooks, made by Dell Inc DELL.O, Asus (2357.TW), Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) and others, will make them too expensive for some consumers. Executives on the conference call suggested Intel has no plan to reduce its chip prices to make Ultrabooks more affordable, a move that would hurt gross margins. Intel maintained a prediction that by year-end, 40 percent of all consumer laptops sold will be Ultrabooks. In the short-term PC sales may slow as some consumers consider putting off new purchases until Microsoft launches its new Windows 8 operating system, expected in October. Intel said non-GAAP gross margins in the second quarter were 64 percent. Intel maintained its full-year gross margin forecast of 64 percent. Shares of Intel fell 1.5 percent in extended trading before paring losses. It had ended about 1 percent higher at $25.38 on Nasdaq.

304,INTC,Instant View: Intel presages weak PC market; Gelsinger CEO at VMWare,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Top chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) forecast weaker than expected current-quarter revenues, reinforcing fears that a wavering global economy and a lack of consumer interest are dampening personal computer sales. Also on Tuesday, storage corporation EMC EMC.N and subsidiary VMWare Inc (VMW.N) announced preliminary quarterly results, and confirmed that EMC’s Pat Gelsinger will take the helm at VMWare. Commentary: “They cut numbers, but inventories are up quite a bit. Things are slowing and high inventories may be a headwind. People were expecting them to guide revenues to be flat or lower in the third quarter. “Things seem to be slowing much more. We still think the guidance is a bit too optimistic.” “Intel did a very good job delivering results close to where estimates had drifted on the Street. Their Q3 estimate was very close to what I was expecting. If you look at the full-year guidance for 2012, they are basically saying 7.5 percent third quarter growth and mid single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. That’s very close to Street expectations. “As macro events have transpired in the second quarter, people looked at the original high single-digit guidance as being stretched. The Street would have been concerned had they stuck with that guidance, but they didn’t. “It’s a solid print and outlook for the third quarter and full year, given the economic backdrop they’re dealing with. The PC client business — their biggest — was $60 million below our estimate. That’s infinitesimal. The data center business was a little bit better than expected.” “Execution in Q2 was a little bit better than expected, but it looks like they are balancing that with a little bit lower revenue growth and spending than I was expecting in Q3. Gross margins look pretty good. “This will largely be viewed as in line, with Q2 a little bit better than expected. But there’s a risk that these numbers could still sound challenging to achieve. “The seasonal growth that Intel is expecting is less than normal. That is clearly taking into account global macro conditions. Normal seasonal PC demand would show Q3 growth of at least 9 to 10 percent, and Intel’s guidance is comfortably below that.” “It’s an interesting move, Paul has done a tremendous job at VMWare. He’s primarily responsible for taking VMWare from a startup to a global organization. “This is good for EMC. It needs the type of leadership that someone like Paul can bring. You have to wonder how much longer Joe Tucci will be CEO, and that Paul may take over if he wants to. VMWare has really kept up with Gartner’s expectations in 2012 in server virtualization. Microsoft will not have a real competitive product out until the end of the year. “Pat Gelsinger is a very capable executive. For folks on the inside, it will be an easy transition because Pat is a lot like Paul with his tech background. He is not afraid to talk tech and he will have instant credibility in Palo Alto.” “There’s a sense of relief that the quarter is okay, but I don’t think investors are happy to see EMC slopping out Paul Maritz. If It’s not broken, why do you fix it? “I’m glad they made the quarter okay, but I don’t like shifting management like this. I’m just not convinced this is in the best interest of the shareholders. “Maritz is a known entity, we already have a new CFO, why do we have to have a new CEO at this time? I don’t think investors are happy. “I mean he was running one of the biggest software companies, and now he’s doing this strategy thing at EMC.” ",7172012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-intel-earnings-instantview/instant-view-intel-presages-weak-pc-market-gelsinger-ceo-at-vmware-idUSBRE86G16120120717
305,INTC,TEXT-Fitch:Intel deal positive for ASML and semiconductor industry,"July 17 - ASML’s customer co-investment programme, which includes  a proposed 15% equity participation by Intel, is positive for the Dutch-based  lithography company on many fronts, and will have wider benefits for the  semiconductor industry, Fitch Ratings says. The programme will see Intel take an initial 10% stake, rising to 15% subject to  ASML shareholder approval for total cash proceeds of EUR2.5bn. Negotiations with  Samsung (‘A+’/Stable) and TSMC (not rated) could lead to them taking strategic  stakes of up to a further 10%. Importantly, strategic owners will make material  commitments to fund ASML’s R&D; for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and 450mm  lithography, as well as advance purchase commitments for these technologies,  over the next five years. The announcement last week is a key development for ASML (‘BBB’/Stable). It  opens the way for significant minority ownership by some of the industry’s  largest manufacturers. Intel, Samsung and TSMC are ASML’s largest customers and  bellwether companies for capital spending and for dictating the pace at which  lithography techniques can advance. Intel’s commitment highlights how embedded ASML has become in the industry’s  supply chain, specifically in “feature shrink.” This is the physics of making  chips smaller and improving the capabilities of devices like smartphones. In addition to its equity investment, Intel will commit R&D; funding of  approximately EUR830m over five years. Roughly two-thirds of this will be aimed  at accelerating the ability to process 450mm wafers verses the current 300mm  standard, and one-third to EUV. This investment is expected to bring forward the  delivery of production tools for 450mm and second generation EUV by two years to  2018. EUV and 450mm are potentially the most important technological changes for the  industry for the next 10 to 15 years. Equity and R&D; participation by key  customers shares the risks and mitigates the margin pressures caused by  developing this level of new technology. This acceleration and other co-investment agreements are likely to further  consolidate advanced semiconductor manufacturing capabilities, as perhaps one  other lithographer and fewer semiconductor makers will have the resources to  keep up. As a result, these companies are likely to consolidate market share. ASML is being chosen by its customers to be one of the few members of the  semiconductor supply chain with advanced technology capabilities. Leading edge  lithography is now effectively a two-player market. Intel is also supporting  Nikon’s development of 450mm tools, but the structure and scale of the ASML  investment stands out, while its R&D; support for ASML’s EUV development  underlines ASML’s leadership in advanced techniques. Partnerships of this nature  and scale are likely, in our view, to make it difficult for ASML’s competitor to  win significant market share in this technology. For Intel and the wider industry the programme accelerates the timing in which  these technologies become available as mainstream production techniques. The  move to 450mm will have significant cost advantages for the industry. Moving to  450mm from 300mm doubles the wafer area and the number of chips that can be  produced on a wafer. Intel estimates 30% - 40% cost savings and an NPV benefit to its cost structure  of USD10bn. These savings will multiply across the industry and the move to  450mm will now be possible that much sooner. The non-voting and non-exclusive  nature of Intel’s participation ensures that these benefits will be spread  across the industry. For Intel, the investment is a key element of its defence of the PC market  against ARM-based processor solutions, as well as Intel’s strategy to break into  smartphone and tablet markets in the longer-term.",7172012,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWLA038720120717

Chipmaker Intel Corp reduced its growth forecast due to macroeconomic concerns late on Tuesday, but gross margins were healthy and the stock rose 3.3 percent to $26.21.  Intel boosted technology shares and helped the market to rise for a second day. “The theme coming out in earnings is companies are coming in short in revenue but still beat on earnings. Analysts have moved their targets (lower) and companies still are lean and mean and are able to generate profit,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. Companies remain cautious about a slowing economy, feeding the market’s hopes for further stimulus from the Federal Reserve. Forrest said the market “really, really wants QE3,” or more monetary stimulus from the Fed. “Bernanke is painting a dire picture and the bulls in the market are holding out for more Fed action.” Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke repeated in congressional testimony on Wednesday the Fed’s pledge to act if the economy needed it as he underscored his concerns, specifically in the job market. Later in the day, the Fed’s anecdotal Beige Book survey showed the economy is still struggling. Honeywell Inc’s profits topped consensus views in  what it called a “tough macroeconomic environment,” and its 6.7 percent advance to $58.18 made it a top gainer on the S&P; industrial sector.

Corporations, nonetheless, are cautious about a slowing economy, lifting the market’s hopes for further stimulus from the Federal Reserve. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke repeated in congressional testimony on Wednesday the Fed’s pledge to act if the economy needed it as he underscored his concerns, specifically in the job market. Honeywell Inc’s profits topped consensus views in  what it called a “tough macroeconomic environment,” and its 6.1 percent advance to $57.87 led gains on the S&P; industrial sector. Chipmaker Intel Corp reduced its growth forecast also on macro concerns, but its gross margins were healthy and the stock rose 3.5 percent to $26.27, boosting technology shares. The PHLX semiconductor index jumped 3.4 percent a day after hitting its 2012 low. “The main driver is technology and that is driven by Intel,” said Michael James, senior trader at regional investment bank Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles. “People were overly pessimistic on Intel and semiconductors in general going into Intel’s report and guidance last night, so it’s a ‘buy the news.’” Data storage equipment maker EMC Corp also boosted tech shares with an 9.9 percent gain to $25.17 after it replaced the head of its VMware Inc unit and reported a preliminary second-quarter profit.

Vivus Inc shares jumped 10 percent to $29.14 after regulators approved the company’s weight-loss drug. “The theme coming out in earnings is companies are coming in short in revenue but still beat on earnings.

308,INTC,Intel's outlook soothes antsy investors,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The shares of Intel Corp (INTC.O) and other technology stocks surged after the top chipmaker trimmed its outlook and signaled that the PC industry might be down but is not out. Intel’s recently punished stock jumped on Wednesday after the company reported second-quarter earnings late the day before. The shares of Hewlett Packard Co (HPQ.N), Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), Dell Inc DELL.O and other technology heavyweights also rose. On Tuesday, the chipmaker, a barometer of the PC industry, cut its 2012 revenue growth forecast to between 3 percent and 5 percent, down from a prior forecast of “high single-digit growth. “Intel is telling us, yes, things are weak, but it’s not disaster weak,” said Raymond James analyst Hans Mosesmann. “There had been a school of thought that they could guide down - and they didn’t.” Shaky economies in Europe and the United States and a growing consumer preference for Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) iPad tablets have been taking a toll on the PC industry. Fears that global PC sales could be worse than expected, with emerging signs of trouble in China, have helped push Intel’s shares down about 10 percent since the end of April and prior to Wednesday’s rally. Intel’s stock recently traded around 10 times expected earnings. With analysts now reducing their estimates for Intel’s future earnings, investors may see that PE ratio as more reflective of the chipmaker’s value. “Once the numbers get cut it allows investors to say: ‘I’m more comfortable with the denominator in that PE calculation,’” Mosesmann said. Last week, tech investors got a jolt when Intel’s smaller rival, Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.N, warned that its second-quarter revenue might plummet 11 percent compared with the first quarter. Also on Wednesday, IBM Corp (IBM.N) reports its quarterly earnings and investors will be watching the tech bellwether for signs of trouble in global enterprise IT spending. Analysts from at least four brokerages lowered their price targets on Intel after its earnings report. Some raised concerns about Intel’s inventory levels rising about 9 percent sequentially for the second quarter. “While we can’t rule out the risk that inventory build represents to gross margins, it is incumbent upon a weaker demand environment than Intel currently envisions; in other words, inventories themselves are not the problem - demand is the primary concern,” Citi Investment Research analysts said. Intel, which said a glut in its Ivy Bridge microarchitecture was the major reason for increased inventory, maintained its 2012 gross margin forecast of 64 percent. It also forecast that “Ultrabooks” would comprise 40 percent of all laptops sold by the year-end. Analysts at Piper Jaffray believe the company’s weaker outlook is also the result of “too expensive” Ultrabooks and consumers preferring smartphones and tablets to personal computers. “We expect lack of excitement in PC clients will drive a mix shift to lower price point notebooks and ultimately pressure gross margin and growth,” Piper Jaffray analysts said. Evercore Partners cut its price target on Intel stock to $26 from $27, while Canaccord Genuity lowered it to $26 from $28. Jefferies & Co reduced its target price on the stock to $29 from $30 and RBC Capital Markets cut it to $30 from $33. According to Thomson Reuters StarMine, 13 analysts rate the stock “strong buy,” 11 rate it a “buy,” 25 a “hold” and five have a “sell,” with a mean price target of $29.14. Intel shares were up 3.74 percent at $26.31 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq. ",7182012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-intel-research/intels-outlook-soothes-antsy-investors-idUSBRE86H0FC20120718

In a reversal of the morning’s premarket action, BofA fell while Intel Corp rallied. It had been pressured a day after it cut its outlook, though it also reported a better-than-expected profit. Financial shares were the weakest of the day, dropping 0.5 percent. Bank of America Corp lost 1.4 percent to $7.81 after swinging to a second-quarter profit that followed a massive mortgage-related charge a year earlier. It also posted a decline in revenue. With the share decline, BofA breaks a streak of post-result rallies by such financials as JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup Inc and Goldman Sachs. Intel late Tuesday cut its full-year revenue outlook, the latest tech name to warn on demand, but the shares rebounded 2.5 percent to $26 in early trading and lifted technology shares 1 percent. “We’re relatively stable today with a relief rally in Intel since people were worried the results would be much worse than what was delivered, though there are still some questions about financials, especially ones with a lot of derivative exposure like Bank of America,” said Clark Yingst, chief market analyst at Joseph Gunnar & Co in New York. With 7 percent of S&P; 500 companies having reported thus far in the earnings season, 65 percent have beaten profit expectations, according to the latest Thomson Reuters data. Only 15 percent have missed. Industrial shares also climbed, advancing 0.8 percent on the back of strong results at Honeywell Inc, which rose 6 percent to $57.79 as profits topped consensus views. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 16.88 points, or 0.13 percent, at 12,822.42. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  was up 3.42 points, or 0.25 percent, at 1,367.09. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 19.80 points, or 0.68 percent, at 2,929.84. Investors also looked to Ben Bernanke, the U.S. Federal Reserve chairman, who will deliver the semi-annual “Monetary Policy Report to the Congress” before the House Financial Services Committee. Bernanke testified before a Senate committee on Tuesday, and while he didn’t give any specifics over what the central bank might do to accelerate growth amid signs of weakness, he left the door open to more stimulus if it became clear unemployment was not falling or if deflation risks mounted. “There’s a lot of speculation about policy shifts, possible quantitative easing, and that will drive markets both ways going forward,” Yingst said.

Financials will also be in focus following results from Bank of America Corp, which swung to a second-quarter profit following a massive mortgage-related charge a year earlier. The Dow component rose 1.6 percent to $8.05 in premarket trading, following similar rallies by JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup Inc and Goldman Sachs. Intel Corp late Tuesday cut its full-year revenue outlook and said consumer spending in Europe and the United States was softer than previously thought. “We’re clearly seeing softness in company revenue because of Europe and the global slowdown, and that’s a concern,” said Oliver Pursche, president at Gary Goldberg Financial Services in Suffern, New York. “We’re seeing those fears spread across industries, but Bank of America is another example of financials being surprisingly strong. That could be a sector that shines because expectations are so low.” Among tech stocks, Advanced Micro Devices and Applied Materials also cut their guidance in recent weeks, contributing to month-to-date losses of more than 2 percent in the S&P; information technology index. The group is considered a proxy for business spending, and the weak views in the sector could have broader implications. S&P; 500 futures fell 4.3 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures fell 37 points and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 6.75 points. Still, earnings reports at large continue to be solid. With 7 percent of S&P; 500 companies having reported, 65 percent have beaten profit expectations, according to the latest Thomson Reuters data. Only 15 percent have missed.

312,INTC,Intel forecast portends weak PC sales,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Top chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) reduced its growth forecast, reinforcing fears that a wavering global economy and a lack of consumer interest are dampening personal computer sales. Shaky economies in Europe and the United States and a growing consumer preference for Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) iPad tablets have been taking a toll on the PC industry. The world’s leading chipmaker on Tuesday cut its 2012 revenue growth forecast to between 3 and 5 percent, down from a prior forecast of “high single-digit growth.” That put Intel’s outlook in line with many investors’ recently reduced expectations and helped cushion a sell-off of its stock. “As macro events have transpired in the second quarter, people looked at the original high single-digit guidance as being stretched,” said Craig Ellis, an analyst at Caris & Company. “The Street would have been concerned had they stuck with that guidance - but they didn’t.” Fears that global PC sales may be worse than expected have helped push Intel’s shares down about 10 percent since the end of April. Intel’s stock has recently traded around 10 times expected earnings. Intel Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said consumer spending in Europe and the United States is softer than previously thought. “At the beginning of the year we would have expected, along with most economists, that economic growth would start picking up and that would lead to an increase in consumer sales. Those expectations are now more muted,” Smith said in an interview after Intel posted its second-quarter earnings. Revenue rose to $13.5 billion from $13.03 billion in the year-ago period, but fell short of the $13.56 billion expected. Intel forecast current-quarter revenue of $14.3 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts on average had expected $14.60 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. GAAP net income fell to $2.8 billion from $2.95 billion in the year-ago period. GAAP earnings per share were 54 cents, below analysts’ average forecast of 52 cents. Intel’s report came after its smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices AMD.N last week slashed its outlook for second-quarter revenue on disappointing sales in Europe and China, where economic growth has recently lost some steam. China and other emerging markets have been a key source of growth in recent quarters for chipmakers Intel and AMD, and PC manufacturers like Lenovo (0992.HK) and Acer (0992.HK), helping make up for weakness in the Europe and the United States. “Emerging markets, especially China and Brazil, are still growing nicely but are moderating due to GDP adjustments and currency fluctuations,” Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini told analysts on a conference call. Smith said global enterprise IT spending was expanding as expected, more due to the buildout of data centers powering the Internet than tech infrastructure upgrades by banks or other corporations. Doug Freedman, an analyst at RBC, said Intel’s forecast for the current quarter was less than typical for this time of year. “Normal seasonal PC demand would show Q3 growth of at least 9 to 10 percent and Intel’s guidance is comfortably below that,” he said. Intel supplies processors for 80 percent of the world’s PCs but it has yet to make significant progress in fast-growing tablets or smartphones, products that use chips based on technology from British-based ARM Holdings ARM.L. While the tablet market is still small, demand for the devices is growing much more quickly than for PCs. Shipments of tablets including Apple’s iPad are expected to grow 90 percent this year, according to IHS iSuppli. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS), Texas Instruments Inc (TXN.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) make many of the power-efficient processors used in tablets and smartphones. Intel is heavily promoting a new category of “Ultrabook” laptops with premium features like solid-state drives that it hopes will add some zest to a PC market that some see as lackluster compared to tablets and smartphones. Many analysts are concerned that touch screens and other high-end features on upcoming Ultrabooks, made by Dell Inc DELL.O, Asus (2357.TW), Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) and others, will make them too expensive for some consumers. Executives on the conference call suggested Intel has no plan to reduce its chip prices to make Ultrabooks more affordable, a move that would hurt gross margins. Intel maintained a prediction that by year-end, 40 percent of all consumer laptops sold will be Ultrabooks. In the short-term PC sales may slow as some consumers consider putting off new purchases until Microsoft launches its new Windows 8 operating system, expected in October. Intel said non-GAAP gross margins in the second quarter were 64 percent. Intel maintained its full-year gross margin forecast of 64 percent. Shares of Intel fell 1.5 percent in extended trading before paring losses. It had ended about 1 percent higher at $25.38 on Nasdaq.

313,INTC,Chipmaker AMD's revenue forecast disappoints,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices AMD.N forecast third-quarter revenue below expectations on Thursday as it struggles with a weak global economy, tepid PC sales and relentless pressure from top chipmaker Intel (INTC.O). AMD, like others in the PC industry, has been hit by a shaky global economy and the consumer shift toward tablets and smartphones, and it has also lost market share. AMD’s stock fell more than 5 percent in after-hours trading following its earnings report. “Clearly our performance in the quarter was disappointing and did not meet our commitments,” AMD Chief Executive Rory Read told analysts on a conference call. “We expect macro headwinds will continue for the third quarter.” AMD said its second-quarter revenue was $1.41 billion, in line with a warning from the company last week and down from $1.57 billion a year ago. It estimated third-quarter revenue would fall 1 percent from the second quarter, plus or minus 3 percent. Analysts had expected AMD would have $1.50 billion in revenue for the current quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. On Tuesday, Intel, a barometer of the PC industry, cut its 2012 revenue growth forecast to between 3 percent and 5 percent, from a prior forecast of “high single-digit growth. Read told analysts AMD’s processor shipments would grow by a low single-digit percentage this year, and that the Sunnyvale, California-based company is trying to improve its ability to execute. Concerns about AMD’s execution and fears that global PC sales could be worse than expected, with emerging signs of weakness in China, have helped push the chipmaker’s stock down about 38 percent since the end of March. “I don’t think there’s any reason to have any confidence in their guidance, as weak as it is. It’s below seasonal, but I have to believe there’s very low visibility in this environment right now,” said Alex Gauna, an analyst at JMP Securities. Also on Thursday, chipmaker Freescale Semiconductor FSL.N reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by tighter cost controls, but forecast third-quarter revenue below analysts’ estimates, sending its shares down 12 percent after hours. In recent years, AMD has carved a niche providing processors for low priced laptops, with Intel dominating higher-end PCs. But as AMD ramps up production of its new Trinity and Brazos 2.0 processors, it lost some market share in the second quarter, Read said. And with PC manufacturers planning to launch cheaper laptops using inexpensive chip designs licensed by ARM Holdings, AMD could face additional competition. “I continue to believe this is a story that’s structurally disadvantaged relative to the greater momentum behind ARM-based computing and the greater ability to invest and innovate of Intel,” Gauna said.

Analysts had expected AMD would have $1.50 billion in revenue for the current quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. On Tuesday, Intel, a barometer of the PC industry, cut its 2012 revenue growth forecast to between 3 percent and 5 percent, from a prior forecast of “high single-digit growth. Read told analysts AMD’s processor shipments would grow by a low single-digit percentage this year, and that the Sunnyvale, California-based company is trying to improve its ability to execute. Concerns about AMD’s execution and fears that global PC sales could be worse than expected, with emerging signs of weakness in China, have helped push the chipmaker’s stock down about 38 percent since the end of March. “I don’t think there’s any reason to have any confidence in their guidance, as weak as it is. It’s below seasonal, but I have to believe there’s very low visibility in this environment right now,” said Alex Gauna, an analyst at JMP Securities. Also on Thursday, chipmaker Freescale Semiconductor FSL.N reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by tighter cost controls, but forecast third-quarter revenue below analysts’ estimates, sending its shares down 12 percent after hours. In recent years, AMD has carved a niche providing processors for low priced laptops, with Intel dominating higher-end PCs. But as AMD ramps up production of its new Trinity and Brazos 2.0 processors, it lost some market share in the second quarter, Read said. And with PC manufacturers planning to launch cheaper laptops using inexpensive chip designs licensed by ARM Holdings, AMD could face additional competition. “I continue to believe this is a story that’s structurally disadvantaged relative to the greater momentum behind ARM-based computing and the greater ability to invest and innovate of Intel,” Gauna said. Appointed last year, Read is realigning AMD’s PC-focused business to meet growing demand for mobile gadgets. But the company has yet to make any major progress selling its chips for new kinds of devices. And while AMD cuts spending to protect profitability, Intel recently announced it was investing $4.1 billion with Dutch chip equipment maker ASML (ASML.AS) to speed up the development of new manufacturing technology. AMD had a quarterly net profit of $37 million, or 5 cents a share, compared with a net profit of $61 million, or 8 cents a share, a year-ago. Adjusted earnings were 6 cents per share. Shares of AMD fell 5.6 percent in extended trade after closing down 0.61 percent at $4.86.

319,INTC,ASML says TSMC joins Intel to invest in latest chip kit,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - ASML, the global chip equipment maker, has signed up TSMC to further bankroll its research and development into costly next-generation chip-making kit to make micro chips smaller, smarter and cheaper, the Dutch firm said on Sunday. Last month, ASML’s chief executive Eric Meurice said he had asked its three biggest customers - Intel Corp., TSMC, and Samsung Electronics - to help fund its costly R&D; and invest in up to 25 percent of its shares. ASML said on Sunday TSMC agreed to invest 276 million euros in research over the coming five years and will also take a 5 percent equity stake in ASML, valued at 838 million euros. ASML cut a similar deal with Intel Corp. in July and said then that it expected to reach agreements with TSMC and Samsung Electronics to accelerate the development of its “extreme ultraviolet” or EUV lithography technology and 450-millimeter lithography tools. Fast-tracking the development of such technology not only cements ASML’s position as the market leader ahead of Nikon, but could also slash production costs for hot consumer gadgets such as smartphones and tablet computers. When ASML announced its first customer deal with Intel on July 9th, Intel said it hoped the R&D; investment boost would help speed up the adoption of the next generation of chip manufacturing processes from ASML by as much as two years. At the time, some analysts said paying $50 for a tablet computer is not beyond the realm of possibility. “One of the biggest challenges facing IC scaling today is how to effectively control the escalating wafer manufacturing cost,” said Shang-yi Chiang, TSMC executive vice president and co-chief operating officer, who added that is he confident the program with ASML will speed up the development of new technologies. ASML, the world’s largest supplier to chipmakers of machines that etch circuits onto silicon wafers, wants to spread the risk of developing cutting-edge equipment based on 450-millimeter wafer sizes and EUV lithography. “The objective of the Co-Investment program is to secure and accelerate key lithography technologies. These technologies will benefit the entire industry and are not restricted to our Co-Investment partners,” said Meurice. A shift to cutting-edge EUV helps push the natural progression of semiconductor technology advancement known as “Moore’s Law”, which posits that the average number of transistors packed on a chip doubles every 18 months.

322,INTC,"Intel, Apple leading charge against conflict minerals: report","UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Intel, Motorola Solutions, Hewlett Packard and Apple are pioneering progress toward wiping out the use of conflict minerals - like tantalum, tin and tungsten - in their products, but other companies are lagging, according to a report by a nonprofit rights group. The Enough Project - an arm of the Center for American Progress that combats crimes against humanity - placed Nintendo at the bottom of its conflict minerals ranking and also singled out HTC, Sharp, Nikon and Canon for a lack of progress. “Nintendo has made no known effort to trace or audit its supply chain,” the “Taking conflict out of consumer gadgets” report said. “Sharp, HTC, Nikon and Canon are taking initial steps to join industry efforts, but their progress remains far behind industry leaders.” Nikon declined to comment on the report. Sharp, HTC, Canon and Nintendo were not immediately available for comment. The Enough Project scored companies on efforts to trace the source of the minerals and metals used, whether detailed audits of supply chains were being carried out, and if steps are being taken to develop an international conflict-free certification. Other criteria included environmental rankings and whether support had been expressed for legislation on conflict minerals. Intel, Motorola Solutions, HP and Apple “have moved forward to develop solutions despite delays in the legislative rule-making process by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC - an excuse that many other companies have used to explain their lack of significant action,” the report said. The 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law requires companies to disclose whether they use tantalum, tin, gold or tungsten from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is due to vote on August 22 on long-delayed guidelines needed to enforce the conflict minerals law. Intel, Motorola Solutions, HP and Apple have taken steps including developing a smelter auditing program and an aid project for lagging smelters and aid projects to help develop a clean minerals trade, the report said. The Enough Project said SanDisk, Philips, Sony, Panasonic, RIM and AMD have significantly improved their efforts “by surveying their suppliers, piloting due diligence, and joining the smelter audit program.” The U.S. conflict minerals rule has been arguably one of the most controversial rules in the Dodd-Frank law. Companies would need to identify if any conflict minerals are used in their products. If the minerals are present, the companies would then need to conduct a due diligence check to track them through the supply chain to their origins.

334,INTC,Intel cuts outlook on weak PC demand; shares drop,"SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Intel Corp cut its third-quarter revenue estimate more than expected on Friday due to a decline in demand for its chips as customers reduce inventories and businesses buy fewer personal computers. Intel also said it was scaling back capital spending as a result of the business slowdown. Intel’s stock was down 3.7 percent on Friday afternoon, and shares of ASML Holding NV and other companies that make chip-manufacturing equipment also lost ground. A revision of Intel targets had been expected by some analysts after PC makers Hewlett Packard Co and Dell Inc warned of slow demand last month, a development that has been compounded by a shaky global economy and consumers shifting toward tablets and smartphones. But the 8 percent reduction in the top chipmaker’s revenue outlook was much more severe than expected. Intel also withdrew its full-year forecast. The scaled-back outlook comes just days ahead of a major event where Intel will tout a new generation of processors that consume less power, central to its strategy of reinvigorating a stagnant PC industry. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said the size of the Intel cut was surprising. Weakness in PC sales to businesses and governments, known as enterprise sales, cited by Intel also raised concerns. “In the last six to eight quarters, consumers have been weak but the enterprise was strong. Now the enterprise is weak,” Rasgon said. Intel’s warning comes at a time when PC makers should be gearing up to build more computers than usual ahead of the launch of Microsoft Corp’s Windows Phone 8 operating system. Intel has been banking on the Windows 8 release in October to help slow the trend of consumers buying smartphones and tablets instead of PCs. Devices running Windows 8 and powered by Intel’s latest components will be a major draw when thousands of technology professionals descend on the annual Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco next week. While a Windows release normally boosts computer sales, analysts believe it might not help as much this time. At the forum, Intel is expected to show off a range of Ultrabook laptops powered by recently launched Ivy Bridge processors, as well as hybrid devices with screens that detach from keyboards to be used as tablets. Along with concerns about consumer demand being hurt by the weak economy, manufacturers are reluctant to commit their resources until they have a better idea of which kinds of new devices will become hits with consumers. “You’re trying to decide are people going to buy ... a tablet that slots into a keyboard, or are they going buy traditional notebooks or ultrabooks?” said MKM Partners analyst Daniel Berenbaum. “In the absence of knowing what to sell, there’s a clear reluctance to build any sort of further inventory.” POWER-EFFICIENT CHIPS Intel’s next-generation PC processor, code-named Haswell, will also be front-and-center at the forum, with executives talking up improved power performance that will let future laptops stay on longer without needing a recharge. Haswell, due to appear in a crop of laptops released for next year’s holiday season, will improve on computing and graphics features and is targeted to reduce electricity consumption from 17 watts to 10 watts, according to Intel.

335,INTC,UPDATE 4-Intel cuts outlook on weak PC demand; shares slump,"* Intel withdraws full-year forecast * Cuts 3rd-qtr revenue view to $13.2 billion * Shares down 3.4 pct * Pulls back capital spending By Noel Randewich and Nicola Leske SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Intel Corp cut its third-quarter revenue estimate more than expected on Friday due to a decline in demand for its chips as customers reduce inventories and businesses buy fewer personal computers. Intel also said it was scaling back capital spending as a result of the business slowdown. Intel’s stock fell 3.6 percent, and shares of ASML  and other companies that make chip-manufacturing equipment also lost ground. A revision of Intel targets had been anticipated by some analysts after PC makers Hewlett Packard and Dell Inc  warned of slow demand last month, a development that has been compounded by a shaky global economy and consumers shifting toward tablets and smartphones. But the 8 percent reduction in the top chipmaker’s revenue outlook was much more severe than expected. Intel also withdrew its full-year forecast. The scaled-back outlook comes just days ahead of a major event where Intel will tout a new generation of processors that consume less power, central to its strategy of reinvigorating a stagnant PC industry. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said the size of the Intel cut was surprising and was a worrying new sign that the company is seeing weakness in PC sales to businesses and governments, known as enterprise sales. “They also have weakness in enterprise PCs in emerging markets. In the last six to eight quarters, consumers have been weak but the enterprise was strong. Now the enterprise is weak,” Rasgon said. Intel’s warning comes at a time when PC makers should be gearing up to build more computers than usual ahead of the launch of Microsoft Corp’s Windows Phone 8 operating system. Intel has been banking on the Windows 8 release in October to help slow the trend of consumers buying smartphones and tablets instead of personal computers. Devices running Windows 8 and powered by Intel’s latest components will be a major draw when thousands of technology professionals descend on the annual Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco next week. While a major Windows release normally boosts computer sales, analysts believe it might not help as much this time. At the forum, Intel is expected to show off a range of Ultrabook laptops powered by recently launched Ivy Bridge processors, as well as hybrid devices with screens that detach from keyboards to be used as tablets. Along with concerns about consumer demand being hurt by the weak economy, manufacturers are reluctant to commit their resources until they have a better idea of which kinds of new devices will become hits with consumers. “You’re trying to decide are people going to buy ... a tablet that slots into a keyboard, or are they going buy traditional notebooks or ultrabooks,” MKM Partners analyst Daniel Berenbaum said. “In the absence of knowing what to sell, there’s a clear reluctance to build any sort of further inventory.” POWER-EFFICIENT CHIPS Intel’s next-generation PC processor, codenamed Haswell, will also be front and center at the forum, with executives talking up improved power performance that will let future laptops stay on longer without needing a recharge. Haswell, due to appear in a crop of laptops released for next year’s holiday season, will improve on computing and graphics features and is targeted to reduce electricity consumption from 17 watts to 10 watts, according to Intel. Intel said it now expects third-quarter revenue of $13.2 billion, plus or minus $300 million, down from its previous forecast of $13.8 billion to $14.8 billion. Analysts on average expected $14.2 billion. The company is due to report its third-quarter results in October.

338,INTC,Intel to showcase new chips as investors eye stagnant PC sales,"SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Intel Corp will tout a new generation of processors next week that consume less power, hoping to reinvigorate a stagnant personal computer industry and soothe increasing concerns about its growth. Wall Street is reassessing its outlook for the top chipmaker after Hewlett-Packard Co and Inc warned last month of weak demand for PCs. At least eight analysts have reduced their revenue estimates for the dominant PC chipmaker since August 23, pointing to poor economies in Europe, the United States and China, as well as the growing popularity of mobile gadgets. “The risk of a (negative) preannouncement is extremely high at this point,” said Patrick Wang, an analyst at Evercore Partners. “I think the supply chain is reeling at the elevated levels of inventory out there.” The top chipmaker is banking on Microsoft Corp’s  much anticipated launch of its Windows 8 platform in October to help slow the growing numbers of consumers buying smartphones and tablets instead of personal computers. Devices running Windows 8 and powered by Intel’s latest components will be a major draw when thousands of technology professionals descend on the annual Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco next week. Analysts on average expect revenue of $14.2 billion when Intel reports its third-quarter results in October, still well within the company’s forecast of $13.8 billion to 14.8 billion according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. But in a further sign of growing investor caution, the ratio of put options for Intel shares to call options has risen close to highs not seen since 2006, said Jim Strugger, a derivatives strategist at MKM Partners. Fears of slowing global PC shipments have helped push Intel’s shares down about 11 percent since the end of April. At the forum, Intel’s next-generation PC processor, codenamed Haswell, will be front and center, with executives talking up improved power performance letting future laptops stay on longer without needing a recharge. Haswell, due to appear in a crop of laptops released for next year’s holiday season, will improve on computing and graphics features and is targeted to slash electricity consumption from 17 watts to 10 watts, according to Intel. Intel is also expected to show off a range of Ultrabook laptops powered by recently launched Ivy Bridge processors, as well as hybrid devices with screens that detach from keyboards to be used as tablets. Intel’s processors are used in 80 percent of the world’s PCs but the Santa Clara, California company has been slow to adapt its chips for smartphones and tablets and now trails Qualcomm Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, which design their chips using power-efficient technology licensed from ARM Holdings Plc. The combined market for PCs, smartphones and tablets is expected to almost double over the next four years, but Intel’s share of the processors used in them will dip from 35 percent to 29 percent, according to a report this week from IHS iSuppli. Underscoring mobile gadgets’ heft in the tech industry, Apple on Wednesday will become a distraction for participants at Intel’s forum when it holds a nearby event where it is expected to launch its newest iPhone. The upcoming introduction of tablets running a version of Windows 8 designed to work with ARM-based chips is creating additional uncertainty for manufacturers trying to predict what kinds of new devices will catch on with consumers, said Vijay Rakesh, an analyst at Sterne Agee. Previous versions of Windows worked only with “x86” chips made by Intel and smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices. “The issue is, can we have x86- and ARM-based systems? That’s still a question mark,” Rakesh said. “And then, what is the pricing of these systems versus the iPads and Kindles and other tablets that are out there?” Intel’s new Medfield processor, showcased in phones launched this year in Russia, India and the United Kingdom, surprised some critics who believed the chips would consume too much power. Motorola Mobility, owned by Google Inc, is expected to unveil an Intel-based smartphone in London on September 18, the first of a multi-device agreement with the chipmaker. “They have a respectable seat at the (mobile) table because they surprised a lot of people with Medfield and just how well that did perform,” said Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy. “Their big chance to get more credibility will come with Motorola.”",9072012,http://www.reuters.com/article/intel-outlook/intel-to-showcase-new-chips-as-investors-eye-stagnant-pc-sales-idUSL2E8K4F5520120907

340,INTC,Sharp in talks to supply panels for ultrabooks: sources,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s cash-strapped Sharp Corp is in talks to supply liquid crystal display panels for ultra-thin laptops that typically use processors made by Intel Corp, sources familiar with the matter said. Intel is promoting ultra-thin laptops, known as ultrabooks, to counter tablet computers from Apple Inc. Earlier this year, the U.S. chipmaker signed deals with several panel makers to ensure adequate supplies for a wave of ultrabooks with touch screens expected to hit the market following Microsoft Corp’s launch of Windows 8 in late October. Sharp, with its TV business in retreat, is looking to small displays to spark a revival in its fortunes. Rather than nestle deeper in Apple’s supply chain, Sharp sees the new generation of ultrabooks as a fresh market for its most advanced displays. Intel is attracted by Sharp’s technology for small and midsize LCD panels, the sources said, declining to be identified before an official announcement. The jewel in Sharp’s technology portfolio is the IGZO display. It consumes much less power than conventional LCD displays, is thinner as it requires less backlighting, has a highly-sensitive touch screen, and boasts very high definition. All of those advantages that Sharp’s chief financial officer, Tetsuo Onishi, said this month make it a perfect fit for ultrabooks using Microsoft’s latest operating system. Ultrabooks, which critics say may be too expensive for many consumers, are Intel’s big bet to reinvigorate a personal computer industry that is stagnating due to consumers’ growing preference for tablets and smartphones. With panel supplies a significant priority at Intel right now, a deal with Sharp would be consistent with previous agreements the top chipmaker has made to strengthen its supply chain, a source close to Intel said. In July, Intel said it would spend more than $4 billion to buy as much as 15 percent of Dutch chip gear-maker ASML and fund its research into costly next-generation manufacturing technology. CASH-STRAPPED Sharp’s stock jumped on Friday after a local media report said the Japanese display maker was in negotiations to make Intel its biggest shareholder. The sources said the talks are focused on sealing a business alliance, although they did not rule out the possibility of Intel acquiring a stake in Sharp in the future. Sharp, which is in talks to sell a stake to fellow Apple supplier Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, denied the report by the Mainichi newspaper. Sharp, in the middle of crafting a restructuring plan to secure financial support from lenders, wants more than 30 billion yen ($383 million) from Intel, the newspaper said. An Intel spokesman declined to comment on the report. The Japanese company said last week that talks to sell a 9.9 percent stake to Hon Hai had stalled as the Taiwanese company sought a say in Sharp’s management in return for the investment. Hon Hai Chairman Terry Gou did not address the issue of the planned investment in Sharp at a media briefing on the Taiwanese company’s 4G business plans in Taipei on Friday. He also declined to take questions on the Sharp deal. With as much as 360 billion yen of short-term commercial paper loans to repay, Sharp needs cash. For now, the maker of Aquos TVs is relying on its main banks Mizuho Financial Group and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group for funding. Sharp is expected to complete the revival plan within days to present to the banks, which will decide to provide about 200 billion yen in additional loans, the sources said. The plan includes the sale of its U.S. solar power unit Recurrent Energy bought in 2010, they said. Sharp expects a net loss of 250 billion yen in the year ending March 31, after losing 376 billion yen in the last financial year. Shares of Sharp rose 5 percent to 212 yen on Friday.

343,INTC,"""Intel Inside"" ignites mobile branding war","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - As the mobile computing wars heat up, chipmakers that supply the crucial components inside smartphones and tablets aim to grab more of the glory. Not content to remain in the shadows of hot consumer brands like Apple or Samsung, chipmakers - including Intel, Qualcomm and Nvidia - want consumers to get to know the processors that power their mobile devices. They hope to build brand loyalty in the process. Intel is leading the charge by extending its hugely successful “Intel Inside” marketing campaign beyond personal computers. Launched in 1991, “Intel Inside” stickers turned commodity electronic components into premium products, and eventually became ubiquitous on laptops. This year, the Intel Inside logo has appeared on the backs of smartphones launched in the United Kingdom, India and Russia. Intel hopes to bring the phone campaign to the United States next year, seeking a marketing advantage over rivals like Qualcomm and Nvidia, which are not as well-known among consumers. “Without a doubt, my goal would be to have consumers walk into stores and have Intel Inside as a key driver of which phone or tablet they choose, just like we’ve done in the PC space,” said Brian Fravel, Intel’s head of branding. The world’s top chipmaker dominates the PC market but lags smaller competitors in the fast-growing mobile industry. Intel is flexing its branding muscle to try to catch up. It remains to be seen how many handset manufacturers agree to put the Intel Inside logo on their devices. For emerging smartphone brands, with little name recognition of their own, partnering with Intel may be a “no brainer.” At the other extreme, Apple refuses to share branding with any of its suppliers. The highest-profile smartphone maker so far to use Intel’s branding is Google’s Motorola Mobility, which launched the Razr i in London on Sept 18. Until now, space on most smartphones has been reserved for the vendor, such as Apple or Samsung, and carriers like Verizon Wireless. Providers of operating systems, such as Google’s Android, also covet consumer loyalty - their logos sometimes appear briefly on screens when devices are turned on. A logo-happy approach to smartphones and tablets, though, would run the risk of confusing consumers with what some experts call the NASCAR effect. As a rule, it’s seen as a good idea to add extra branding to products only when the additional brand strongly conveys a quality that the handset maker’s own brand lacks. “Can you generate end-user demand for your processors? That’s what they’re all looking at, and that’s not an easy thing to do in the mobile space where people aren’t accustomed to it,” said Jack Gold, a tech industry analyst at J. Gold Associates. Part of the reason the Intel Inside campaign has been unrivaled in the chip industry is that no one else can match Intel’s $2.1 billion annual budget for advertising and marketing. Intel helps pay for the PC makers’ own ads, as long as they include Intel Inside. A TV ad promoting a phone launched by Orange in the United Kingdom in February features a supersonic car driven by a dark-clad pilot whose clothes are emblazoned with Intel Inside. Intel surveyed customers who bought Orange’s phone. “It wasn’t as though these were tech-savvy people who were reading all the benchmarks. They said Intel Inside meant performance to them,” Intel’s Fravel said. Badly underestimating how quickly the mobile market would grow, Intel was slow to develop application processors, the punchy but energy-efficient chips that drive web surfing, games and other advanced features of smartphones and tablets. Along with Qualcomm, Samsung is a major producer of mobile processors, most of which it manufactures on behalf of Apple’s iPads and iPhones. Texas Instruments and Broadcom also make mobile processors, but do not advertise much to consumers. Since the 1990s, Qualcomm has been a major player in the mobile chip industry. For most of that time, advertising has been an afterthought for the San Diego-based company. Most of Qualcomm’s marketing has been directed at a specific category of tech enthusiasts keenly interested in the components used in their devices. It has taken the form of YouTube videos, Internet ads and social media instead of TV commercials and other pricey campaigns. In October, Qualcomm is set to start a new branding campaign, coinciding with the launch of tablets and other devices using its chips and Microsoft’s next-generation Windows platform. As part of the drive, Qualcomm will share advertising with manufacturers to showcase features of its chips, said Tim McDonough, a Qualcomm vice president responsible for marketing the company’s Snapdragon mobile processors. “You’ll start to see the Snapdragon brand appearing in a lot more places. But the key is having it appear in places where it has value to the user as a starting point. Right now, the consumer is saying, ‘I’m ready for my next phone, I’m not sure what to buy, and I need some help,’” McDonough said, in a telephone interview. McDonough would not say how much Qualcomm plans to spend on advertising to counter Intel, which last year even paid hit Korean pop group Girls’ Generation for TV ads and a single written for Intel. Signaling its growing interest in creating brand awareness, Qualcomm renamed a professional football venue in San Diego “Snapdragon Stadium” for a few days last year. And suggesting Qualcomm sees the PC industry as a model for its marketing, it hired a new chief marketing officer, Anand Chandrasekher, a veteran Intel senior executive, in August. As much smaller Nvidia transitions to the mobile market, it aims to capitalize on game enthusiasts who are passionate about its PC graphics chips. Its well-oiled marketing department hosts tournaments and aggressively interacts with industry pundits. Last year, Nvidia spent just $9.5 million on advertising, a sum that can’t buy anything close to Intel’s broad recognition. But it can help win loyalty from a narrow but influential group of young men. “Intel spends way more money branding Intel Inside, but we’ll go to events, and gamers will come up to us with the Nvidia logo tattooed on their body, shaved on their head,” said Ujesh Desai, Nvidia’s vice president of corporate marketing. Leveraging its popularity with game fans, Nvidia has created Tegra Zone, a collection of games optimized to work better on mobile devices using Nvidia’s Tegra processors. Ads for tablets like Google’s Nexus 7 boast of Nvidia’s punchy graphics. “Our tack doesn’t start with, ‘How much are we going to pay you so you put our logo on there?’ Our tack is more, ‘Here’s how we can partner with you so we can create a great experience,’” Desai said. With stagnant PC sales, executives see mobile gadgets as the future. Annual sales of processors used in smartphones and tablets could hit $25 billion by 2016, compared with $9 billion last year, according to market research firm Strategy Analytics. As formidable as the Intel Inside brand may be, extending it from PCs to a new world of smartphones and tablets has risks. Competition in mobile is fierce. If Intel fails to deliver the top performance that people associate with “Intel Inside,” the chipmaker could damage its prized image. “Putting an ingredient brand on the outside of your product should be like driving a sports car, something you want people to see you do because it’s better,” said Andy Smith, a former Intel employee who was involved with the “Intel Inside” campaign in the late 1990s. “But if the reality is that there’s nothing great about the chips, then it’s going to be hard for them to repeat it.” ",9242012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-technology-chips-marketing/intel-inside-ignites-mobile-branding-war-idUSBRE88N08T20120924

Leveraging its popularity with game fans, Nvidia has created Tegra Zone, a collection of games optimized to work better on mobile devices using Nvidia’s Tegra processors. Ads for tablets like Google’s Nexus 7 boast of Nvidia’s punchy graphics. “Our tack doesn’t start with, ‘How much are we going to pay you so you put our logo on there?’ Our tack is more, ‘Here’s how we can partner with you so we can create a great experience,’” Desai said.

345,INTC,FEATURE-'Intel Inside' ignites mobile branding war,"SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 24 (Reuters) - As the mobile computing wars heat up, chipmakers that supply the crucial components inside smartphones and tablets aim to grab more of the glory. Not content to remain in the shadows of hot consumer brands like Apple or Samsung, chipmakers - including Intel, Qualcomm and Nvidia  - want consumers to get to know the processors that power their mobile devices. They hope to build brand loyalty in the process. Intel is leading the charge by extending its hugely successful “Intel Inside” marketing campaign beyond personal computers. Launched in 1991, “Intel Inside” stickers turned commodity electronic components into premium products, and eventually became ubiquitous on laptops. This year, the Intel Inside logo has appeared on the backs of smartphones launched in the United Kingdom, India and Russia. Intel hopes to bring the phone campaign to the United States next year, seeking a marketing advantage over rivals like Qualcomm and Nvidia, which are not as well-known among consumers. “Without a doubt, my goal would be to have consumers walk into stores and have Intel Inside as a key driver of which phone or tablet they choose, just like we’ve done in the PC space,” said Brian Fravel, Intel’s head of branding. The world’s top chipmaker dominates the PC market but lags smaller competitors in the fast-growing mobile industry. Intel is flexing its branding muscle to try to catch up. It remains to be seen how many handset manufacturers agree to put the Intel Inside logo on their devices. For emerging smartphone brands, with little name recognition of their own, partnering with Intel may be a “no brainer.” At the other extreme, Apple refuses to share branding with any of its suppliers. The highest-profile smartphone maker so far to use Intel’s branding is Google’s Motorola Mobility, which launched the Razr i in London on Sept 18. Until now, space on most smartphones has been reserved for the vendor, such as Apple or Samsung, and carriers like Verizon Wireless. Providers of operating systems , such as Google’s Android, also covet consumer loyalty - their logos sometimes appear briefly on screens when devices are turned on. A logo-happy approach to smartphones and tablets, though, would run the risk of confusing consumers with what some experts call the NASCAR effect. As a rule, it’s seen as a good idea to add extra branding to products only when the additional brand strongly conveys a quality that the handset maker’s own brand lacks. “Can you generate end-user demand for your processors? That’s what they’re all looking at, and that’s not an easy thing to do in the mobile space where people aren’t accustomed to it,” said Jack Gold, a tech industry analyst at J. Gold Associates. Part of the reason the Intel Inside campaign has been unrivaled in the chip industry is that no one else can match Intel’s $2.1 billion annual budget for advertising and marketing. Intel helps pay for the PC makers’ own ads, as long as they include Intel Inside. A TV ad promoting a phone launched by Orange in the United Kingdom in February features a supersonic car driven by a dark-clad pilot whose clothes are emblazoned with Intel Inside. Intel surveyed customers who bought Orange’s phone. “It wasn’t as though these were tech-savvy people who were reading all the benchmarks. They said Intel Inside meant performance to them,” Intel’s Fravel said. Badly underestimating how quickly the mobile market would grow, Intel was slow to develop application processors, the punchy but energy-efficient chips that drive web surfing, games and other advanced features of smartphones and tablets. Along with Qualcomm, Samsung is a major producer of mobile processors, most of which it manufactures on behalf of Apple’s iPads and iPhones. Texas Instruments and Broadcom  also make mobile processors, but do not advertise much to consumers. Since the 1990s, Qualcomm has been a major player in the mobile chip industry. For most of that time, advertising has been an afterthought for the San Diego-based company. Most of Qualcomm’s marketing has been directed at a specific category of tech enthusiasts keenly interested in the components used in their devices. It has taken the form of YouTube videos, Internet ads and social media instead of TV commercials and other pricey campaigns. In October, Qualcomm is set to start a new branding campaign, coinciding with the launch of tablets and other devices using its chips and Microsoft’s next-generation Windows platform. As part of the drive, Qualcomm will share advertising with manufacturers to showcase features of its chips, said Tim McDonough, a Qualcomm vice president responsible for marketing the company’s Snapdragon mobile processors. “You’ll start to see the Snapdragon brand appearing in a lot more places. But the key is having it appear in places where it has value to the user as a starting point. Right now, the consumer is saying, ‘I’m ready for my next phone, I’m not sure what to buy, and I need some help,’” McDonough said, in a telephone interview. McDonough would not say how much Qualcomm plans to spend on advertising to counter Intel, which last year even paid hit Korean pop group Girls’ Generation for TV ads and a single written for Intel. Signaling its growing interest in creating brand awareness, Qualcomm renamed a professional football venue in San Diego “Snapdragon Stadium” for a few days last year.

346,INTC,RPT-Intel zeroes in on enterprise customers with first tablet wave,"SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Intel Corp roped in device makers such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Hewlett Packard Co on Thursday to showcase tablets powered by its new “Atom” processor - a chip it hopes will help it biannually break into that crowded market. Intel initially brushed off any threat from tablets such as Apple Inc’s iPad, but now hopes the combination of a low power consuming processor with touch friendly Microsoft Corp Windows 8 software will win over enterprise customers looking to deploy tablets, but keep PC-based software and hardware. The world’s largest chip maker says the “Atom Z2760” - formerly code named “Clover Trail” - is tailored to work with the latest version of Microsoft’s operating system, due in late October. Tablets that use both the Atom and Widows 8 will be able to run widely used software such as Word and Excel, while connecting to peripherals such as printers. It also lengthens battery life, enabling tablets to run 10-plus hours of streaming high-definition video, said Intel applications processor division chief Eric Reid. Targeting corporations and government agencies means the first wave of Intel-powered tablets and tablet-laptop hybrids will avoid the worst of the consumer war now raging between Google Inc and Amazon.com Inc. “These new Atom-based tablets have been targeted at spaces where Intel and Microsoft can win, the enterprise market, and as an alternative to a notebook,” said Patrick Moorhead, head of Moor Insights and Strategy. Dell Inc, Acer Inc, Asustek Computer Inc  and ZTE Corp round out the half-dozen PC makers that trotted out their upcoming tablets, some of which sport a detachable keyboard or stylus designed to support free-form drawing and writing. “Every tablet shown today does what neither an iPad or  Kindle Fire HD does well, which is creating content and controlling via a keyboard and trackpad,” he said. “This provides differentiation while not going head to head with Apple and Amazon.” With PC sales expected to stagnate over the next year or two, Intel hopes to make up for lost time and regain market share ceded to rivals such as Qualcomm Inc, Texas Instruments Inc and Nvidia Corp, whose applications processors now power most tablets except the iPad. Although the “Intel Inside” sticker remains affixed to 80 percent of the world’s PCs, the Santa Clara, California, company has been slow to adapt its chips for smartphones and tablets. Analysts say the semiconductor industry leader has woken up to the tablet threat only in the past year. It is now rushing into the mobile market, motivated in part by slowing PC sales across consumer, businesses and even the emerging market segments it once relied on to propel sales. This month, it cut its third-quarter revenue estimate by a more than expected 8 percent and withdrew its full-year outlook entirely. Intel’s tablet strategy so far has focused on Windows 8 and its “x86” architecture found in most of the world’s PCs. But executives said this month that tablets running their processors and based on Google’s Android software are also in the works. Microsoft’s main assault on the tablet market involves Windows RT, a version of Windows 8 that works off the ARM Holdings chip designs that now dominate the market and drive the iPad and other mobile devices.",9272012,http://www.reuters.com/article/intel-tablets/rpt-intel-zeroes-in-on-enterprise-customers-with-first-tablet-wave-idUSL1E8KQQWY20120927

353,INTC,The doctor (in the next cubicle) will see you now,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - So much for the “I have a doctor’s appointment” excuse when seeking a three-hour lunch break from work. U.S. companies as diverse as chipmaker Intel Corp and printer Quad/Graphics Inc have opened in-house health clinics with doctors, nurses and even dentists to diagnose suspicious symptoms, write prescriptions and more. Most recently, they are adding services to manage chronic conditions such as diabetes. The clinics and their lengthening list of services reflect the latest efforts to counter soaring healthcare costs. While companies have for years offered yearly flu shots or brought in yoga teachers, that hasn’t been enough to offset expenses from rising obesity rates and other conditions. “We were beginning to see ... growing chronic conditions in our population,” says Tami Graham, director of global benefits for Intel. “All the stuff that ails America, ails Intel.” For every dollar spent on in-company programs, employers get a return on investment of $1.50 to $3, according to a 2009 study by the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, a society of healthcare professionals. But in-house clinics can’t do everything. Workers still want and need outside specialists for complicated health needs like surgery or childbirth. And privacy concerns linger despite legal protections, with some employees worrying that personal data could cause companies to fire less-than-healthy employees. Clinics are “potentially a very good idea,” says Lewis Maltby, president of the National Workrights Institute, a legal advocacy organization. “Assuming, of course, that the medical records are really confidential. That’s a big assumption.” Proponents claim the clinics do protect employee privacy. Employers and employees hail the services, saying they save money and time. Workers can walk to nearby clinics, rather than spending work hours commuting to doctors’ offices. And the convenience prompts many to get symptoms checked quickly. Such was the case with Quad/Graphics customer service representative Tim Liskowitz. After two days of feeling weak and exhausted, Liskowitz visited the clinic in his West Allis, Wisconsin, building. He was dangerously dehydrated and suffering from highly contagious mononucleosis. While being hooked up to intravenous fluids, Liskowitz, a diabetic, met the clinic’s diabetes care coordinator for the first time. After getting mono “out of the way,” Liskowitz began meeting regularly with the diabetes coordinator and found an insulin treatment that worked better than his previous regime. “It was a whole new world from there,” says the 33 year old, who recently lost 30 pounds, more than 10 percent of his body weight, with the help of clinic staff. Stories like these have prompted companies to either add more clinic, or increase their focus on ongoing conditions like obesity. Employers “are seeing a tremendous increase in chronic conditions which is mirroring what we’re seeing in the country,” says Peter Hotz, a group vice president at Walgreen Co. A Walgreen subsidiary, Take Care Health Systems, operates on-site centers for companies. The centers can provide X-rays, physical therapy and emergency care. The division, currently operating about 375 work-site centers, has seen demand grow by “low teens” over the past three years, says Hotz. Clients are clamoring for more anti-obesity measures, so they are stepping up nutritional counseling offerings, says Hotz. Intel has four clinics at different locations and plans to add three more in the “next year or so,” says Graham. To meet growing demand for diabetes care, some have started providing certified diabetes clinicians. Financial firm American Express Co, which has 15 “wellness centers,” has added to its obesity and stop-smoking programs and said it has seen employee weight and tobacco use drop. The growth in clinic demand comes as healthcare costs for employers and employees, are “galloping ahead,” says Helen Darling, president of the National Business Group on Health, a non-profit group that represents large employers’ perspective on national health policy issues. “Unhealthy people cost a lot more,” Darline says, adding that rising obesity rates is one of the biggest culprits. Companies will pay an average $11,664 per employee for healthcare costs this year, up 5.9 percent from last year, according to a Towers Watson/NBGH survey. Employees’ share of premium costs rose 9.3 percent, to $2,764. Some 42 percent of U.S. adults could be obese by 2030, adding $550 billion to healthcare costs over that period, according to a study published earlier this year in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine. That leaves room for a lot of spending on obesity prevention programs, but the clinics are costly for employers to sponsor. An average Intel clinic, for example, can cost $1 million to build and another $1 million to run, says Graham. And there are other drawbacks. Not everyone is thrilled about seeing a company doctor; worries abound that workers could be penalized or fired if their boss sees expensive medical conditions in their personnel records. Clinic proponents, however, say on-site facilities are operated by third-party managers who never disclose data to employers. “There are very strict laws against that,” says Take Care’s Hotz. Maltby recommends all patients ask how medical records are kept and who has access. In addition, employees should always ask their doctor if there is a “doctor-patient relationship,” in which medical conditions are kept private, says Maltby. “If the doctor says ‘yes,’ you can probably proceed with relative confidence,” he says. Many employees find any potential risk worth the reward. American Express counted more than 35,000 visits to its six U.S. wellness centers in the past year. Quad/Graphics’s Liskowitz estimates he’s saved about 120 hours by having regular diabetes checks at his office, rather than traveling. And the convenience and follow-up has improved his life in other ways. “My wife loves it because I’m going to live now,” says Liskowitz.

To meet growing demand for diabetes care, some have started providing certified diabetes clinicians. Financial firm American Express Co, which has 15 “wellness centers,” has added to its obesity and stop-smoking programs and said it has seen employee weight and tobacco use drop. The growth in clinic demand comes as healthcare costs for employers and employees, are “galloping ahead,” says Helen Darling, president of the National Business Group on Health, a non-profit group that represents large employers’ perspective on national health policy issues. “Unhealthy people cost a lot more,” Darline says, adding that rising obesity rates is one of the biggest culprits. Companies will pay an average $11,664 per employee for healthcare costs this year, up 5.9 percent from last year, according to a Towers Watson/NBGH survey. Employees’ share of premium costs rose 9.3 percent, to $2,764. Some 42 percent of U.S. adults could be obese by 2030, adding $550 billion to healthcare costs over that period, according to a study published earlier this year in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine. That leaves room for a lot of spending on obesity prevention programs, but the clinics are costly for employers to sponsor. An average Intel clinic, for example, can cost $1 million to build and another $1 million to run, says Graham. And there are other drawbacks. Not everyone is thrilled about seeing a company doctor; worries abound that workers could be penalized or fired if their boss sees expensive medical conditions in their personnel records. Clinic proponents, however, say on-site facilities are operated by third-party managers who never disclose data to employers. “There are very strict laws against that,” says Take Care’s Hotz. Maltby recommends all patients ask how medical records are kept and who has access. In addition, employees should always ask their doctor if there is a “doctor-patient relationship,” in which medical conditions are kept private, says Maltby. “If the doctor says ‘yes,’ you can probably proceed with relative confidence,” he says. Many employees find any potential risk worth the reward.     American Express counted more than 35,000 visits to its six U.S. wellness centers in the past year.

355,INTC,The doctor (in the next cubicle) will see you now,"(This is part of a five-story series on employee benefits and open enrollment season.) By Chelsea Emery NEW YORK (Reuters) - So much for the “I have a doctor’s appointment” excuse when seeking a three-hour lunch break from work. U.S. companies as diverse as chipmaker Intel Corp and printer Quad/Graphics Inc have opened in-house health clinics with doctors, nurses and even dentists to diagnose suspicious symptoms, write prescriptions and more. Most recently, they are adding services to manage chronic conditions such as diabetes. The clinics and their lengthening list of services reflect the latest efforts to counter soaring healthcare costs. While companies have for years offered yearly flu shots or brought in yoga teachers, that hasn’t been enough to offset expenses from rising obesity rates and other conditions. “We were beginning to see ... growing chronic conditions in our population,” says Tami Graham, director of global benefits for Intel. “All the stuff that ails America, ails Intel.” For every dollar spent on in-company programs, employers get a return on investment of $1.50 to $3, according to a 2009 study by the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, a society of healthcare professionals. Of course, in-house clinics can’t do everything. Workers still want and need outside specialists for complicated health needs like surgery or childbirth. And privacy concerns linger despite legal protections, with some employees worrying that personal data could cause companies to fire less-than-healthy employees. Clinics are “potentially a very good idea,” says Lewis Maltby, president of the National Workrights Institute, a legal advocacy organization. “Assuming, of course, that the medical records are really confidential. That’s a big assumption.” Proponents claim the clinics do protect employee privacy. Employers and employees hail the services, saying they save money and time. Workers can walk to nearby clinics, rather than spending work hours commuting to doctors’ offices. And the convenience prompts many to get symptoms checked quickly. Urgent - and contagious - conditions are then caught earlier. Such was the case with Quad/Graphics customer service representative Tim Liskowitz. After two days of feeling weak and exhausted, Liskowitz visited the clinic in his West Allis, Wisconsin, building. He was dangerously dehydrated and suffering from highly contagious mononucleosis. While being hooked up to intravenous fluids, Liskowitz, a diabetic, met the clinic’s diabetes care coordinator for the first time. After getting mono “out of the way,” Liskowitz began meeting regularly with the diabetes coordinator and found an insulin treatment that worked better than his previous regime. “It was a whole new world from there,” says the 33 year old, who recently lost 30 pounds, more than 10 percent of his body weight, with the help of clinic staff. Stories like these have prompted companies to either add more clinic, or increase their focus on ongoing conditions like obesity. Employers “are seeing a tremendous increase in chronic conditions which is mirroring what we’re seeing in the country,” says Peter Hotz, a group vice president at Walgreen Co. A Walgreen subsidiary, Take Care Health Systems, operates on-site centers for companies. The centers can provide X-rays, physical therapy and emergency care. The division, currently operating about 375 work-site centers, has seen demand grow by “low teens” over the past three years, says Hotz. Clients are clamoring for more anti-obesity measures, so they are stepping up nutritional counseling offerings, says Hotz. Intel has four clinics at different locations and plans to add three more in the “next year or so,” says Graham.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI)  dropped 1.6 percent on Wednesday to 1,948.22 points, its lowest close since Sept. 11. the Kospi has fallen every day this week. Shares in Samsung Electronics, the world’s biggest memory-chip maker, closed down 3.4 percent, the biggest percentage fall since a one-day plunge of nearly 7.5 percent after a California court in August ruled in favour of Apple Inc  in a patent row. Wednesday’s slide spawned a broad decline in the Kospi’s tech stocks. SK Hynix, the second biggest maker of memory chips, lost 2.3 percent. “Worries about global demand hit Samsung shares today after falls in U.S. technology shares,” Lee Sun-tae, an analyst at NH Investment & Securities. Shares of Intel, the world’s largest maker of semiconductor chips, lost 2.7 percent overnight after negative reports by at least two brokerages. Robert W. Baird & Co cut its price target on Intel stock, citing weak demand for notebooks. The news triggered selling of large-cap U.S. technology shares, including Apple and Microsoft. This pattern was repeated in Asia, with the tech sub-index  declining 1.4 percent to be the biggest drag on the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index.

359,INTC,"Analysis: As PC era fades, good times may be over at Intel","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - As tablets and smartphones draw more and more users away from PCs, Intel Corp is facing some difficult questions. Intel, the world’s leading chipmaker, is used to being king of the personal computer market, particularly through its historic “Wintel” alliance with Microsoft Corp, which led to breathtakingly high profit margins and an 80 percent market share. But in the fast-growing and cut-throat mobile world, Intel is struggling - its market share is less than 1 percent of smartphones, trailing Qualcomm Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, ARM Holdings Plc and others. That leaves some investors, already concerned about a lackluster global economy, asking if Intel’s invincibility has come to an end, and whether its profit and revenue growth potential may become much more ordinary. When the company reports third-quarter results on Tuesday, one key figure to watch is gross margin, which analysts forecast at 62 percent. While that is still the envy of smaller chipmakers, it has been declining from a record 67.5 percent in late 2010, a trend analysts expect to continue. “If we’re moving to mobile, which is a low-margin business, it’s difficult to see where the high-margin business is going to be for Intel,” said Michael Yoshikami, chief executive of Destination Wealth Management. “That’s why we own Qualcomm and we don’t own Intel.” Shares of Intel have fallen about 7 percent over the past year. Qualcomm, a leader in providing “logic chips” or processors for tablets, has gained 12 percent. It is not all gloom for Intel. Its highly profitable server chip business, now almost a quarter of revenue, is growing quickly as Internet companies like Google Inc and Amazon.com Inc build more “cloud” data centers to offer services to consumers using mobile gadgets. Shipments of cloud servers are expected to grow at an average annual rate of 31 percent through 2015, much faster than overall server shipments, according to IHS iSuppli. Pointing to an indirect benefit of mobile computing, Intel estimates that for every 600 new smartphones or 120 new tablets bought by consumers, an additional server is needed. Still, the 44-year-old founding member of the Silicon Valley technology industry is struggling to find its place in a world moving quickly to mobile gadgets and social networks. Analysts say emerging markets and business customers will fuel Intel’s growth for the next several years but not at the explosive rates it has often enjoyed in the past. Intel’s revenue is forecast to be roughly flat this year with 2011 and to grow 4 percent next year, according to Wall Street estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That compares with 24 percent annual growth in the past two years. Many technology pundits have declared the end of the PC era since Apple Inc’s iPad hit the scene in 2010 and kick-started the market for touchscreen tablets. Intel was slow to recognize how big a threat tablets would become, with executives describing them as complementary to PCs - a view shared by many others. Increasingly, people are changing their tune. Global PC shipments are expected by analysts to decline slightly this year, the first annual drop since 2001. To inject new life into PCs, Intel has been promoting a new category of thin, “Ultrabook” laptops with touch screens enabled by Microsoft Windows. But the Ultrabooks launched so far have been criticized as too expensive, and manufacturers have shipped fewer than expected. Intel declined to comment. That shortfall was underscored when Intel warned in September of weak demand and cut its own forecast for third-quarter revenue by more than even the most pessimistic analysts expected. The release of Intel’s new Ivy Bridge processor this year was meant to speed up sales of Ultrabooks. But with premium-features like solid-state drives and touch displays, many models went for $1,000 or more - well above the $600-$700 price tag that analysts say is needed to gain traction with consumers. Pointing to those high prices, IHS iSuppli recently slashed its forecast for 2012 shipments of Ultrabooks from 22 million units to 10.3 million units, with half of those expected in the next three months, coinciding with the launch of Windows 8. “The only way it’s going to work is if the PC world can achieve better economies of scale and get those prices down,” said Longbow Research analyst Joanne Feeney. Determined to protect its profit margins, Intel in the past has suggested it will not reduce chip prices to make Ultrabooks more affordable. Intel’s dominance has long allowed it to charge aggressive prices for its processors - unlike many competitors, Intel both designs and manufacturers its own chips. But even with that advantage, along with technological improvements and growing economies of scale, Intel may be hard pressed to preserve margins as it moves further into mobile, where processors sell for much less, analysts said. Gross margins on smartphone processors typically work out to 50 percent, according to D.A. Davidson & Co analyst Aalok Shah. “We believe the post-PC era has arrived,” Piper Jaffray analyst Gus Richard wrote in a recent note to investors. “Moreover, $120 Intel CPUs are being replaced by $25 ARM-based CPUs as PCs are being cannibalized by tablets.” To be sure, many analysts say PC sales will pick up once the economy improves. Market research firm IDC said PC shipments fell 8.6 percent in the third quarter, but it expects annual growth in a range of 6.5 percent to 7.5 percent through 2016. Microsoft also plans to launch a tablet/laptop hybrid using Intel’s processors, aimed at corporate customers looking for a device compatible with business software that does not currently run on the iPad or Android tablets. If nothing else, Intel’s depressed share price has made investors like Capital Advisors fund manager Channing Smith take a closer look. “Obviously the stock is extremely cheap and it has a very attractive dividend yield, but there’s a good reason the stock is where it is, and that’s mainly because strategically they’ve really missed out on mobile,” Smith said.

360,INTC,Intel's outlook fails to inspire hopes for PC recovery,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp’s weak outlook for fourth-quarter revenue and margins dispelled lingering hopes for a revival in PC demand towards the end of the year, pushing its shares 2 percent lower. Intel, along with rival Advanced Micro Devices, had previously warned of weak demand for PCs, hit by a troubled global economy and the growing popularity of tablets like Apple Inc’s iPad, once dismissed as a niche device but now leading a fundamental shift in consumer computing. Intel’s corporate-focused server and data center business has helped offset weak PC sales in recent quarters, but in the third quarter, revenue from that division also disappointed as enterprises bought fewer servers. “You have to remember, data center has been the rock we’ve all leaned on,” said Patrick Wang, an analyst at Evercore Partners. “It’s a reflection of enterprises and companies rationalizing their year-end spend.” With economic growth slowing in China and struggling in Europe and the United States, global PC shipments are expected by analysts to decline slightly this year, the first annual drop since 2001. Intel said the data center business, which sells server chips and other equipment to companies and governments, grew 6 percent year over year in the third quarter, although it was down 5 percent from the prior quarter. Profitability will also take a hit, as Intel idles excess capacity at its plants in an effort to reduce inventories of its processors. It foresees fourth-quarter gross margins of 57 percent, or 58 percent on a non-GAAP basis, both plus or minus a couple of percentage points. Analysts on average expected gross margins of about 62 percent for the current quarter. Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said about two-thirds of the anticipated decline in margins will come from excess capacity charges. Intel is also running its factories at less than 50 percent of their capacity, redirecting unused space and equipment to be used on more cutting-edge production lines still being built. To inject new life into PCs, Intel has been promoting a new category of thin, “Ultrabook” laptops with touch screens enabled by Microsoft’s upcoming Windows 8. But the Ultrabooks launched so far have been criticized as too expensive, and manufacturers have shipped fewer than expected. “I absolutely expect growth in the PC segment, and I firmly believe that the level of innovation we’re seeing in Ultrabooks is going to be one of the catalysts,” Smith told Reuters in a telephone interview. “I’m not going to put a number out there -but I expect it to grow.” Shares of Intel fell to $22.35 in after hours trade, after closing up 2.85 percent at $22.35.

That leaves some investors, already concerned about a lackluster global economy, asking if Intel’s invincibility has come to an end, and whether its profit and revenue growth potential may come back down to earth. The PC industry has been banking on Microsoft’s launch of Windows 8 later in October to breathe new life into laptops and slow the trend of consumers buying smartphones and tablets instead of PCs. But there has been little sign of a significant bump in PC manufacturing or shipments ahead of the launch, at least in the short-term, analysts say. Intel estimated fourth-quarter revenue of $13.6 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts expected $13.74 billion for the current quarter.

Intel’s third-quarter report on Tuesday followed a warning by the top chipmaker in September that demand was weaker than expected and that revenue would fall far short of its forecast.

Homebuilders’ shares climbed after data showed groundbreaking on new homes jumped 15 percent in September, the quickest pace since July 2008 - in a sign that the housing sector’s budding recovery is supporting the broader economy. But both Intel Corp and International Business Machines Corp tumbled a day after they reported results, keeping the Dow negative. IBM alone caused a drag of nearly 88 points on the blue-chip average. Intel also pulled on the Nasdaq 100 The S&P; technology sector index lost 1 percent. Intel gave a weak fourth-quarter revenue outlook while IBM posted third-quarter revenue that came in under expectations. Intel dropped 3.1 percent to $21.65 while IBM lost 5.8 percent to $198.73. Both were among the biggest drags on the Dow. Intel also weighed on the Nasdaq. Bank of America shares slipped 0.5 percent to $9.41 after the second-largest U.S. bank said earnings per share were break-even and down sharply from the year-ago period. Shares of M&T; Bank jumped 5 percent to $102.22 after the company posted third-quarter results, helping push the KBW Bank index up 1.1 percent. Financial companies’ earnings have yielded mixed results so far. Earlier this week, results from Citigroup and Goldman Sachs indicated improvement in the financial sector, though those reports followed disappointments from JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo. Earnings “expectations were extremely conservative, and the results are just not that bad at all. And whenever people begin to get too far in one direction - meaning earnings are going to be terrible - generally reality is better than that, and we are seeing that now,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 33.22 points, or 0.25 percent, to 13,518.56. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 2.25 points, or 0.15 percent, to 1,457.17. The Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 4.83 points, or 0.15 percent, to 3,096.34. After the U.S. Commerce Department’s report on housing starts, the PHLX housing index rose 2.5 percent. The index got a lift from P u lteGroup Inc, up 5.4 percent at $17.46. “They were very good numbers. It does seem to us that the housing market really has bottomed. It’s not going to roar higher, but that is a good thing,” Ghriskey said. The S&P; 500 achieved its best two-day advance in a month, a rise of 1.8 percent through Tuesday’s close, on the heels of last week’s drop - its worst weekly decline in four months. Expectations for a disappointing earnings season, which prompted the last week’s slide, have been tempered this week as more companies post quarterly results. According to Thomson Reuters data through Wednesday morning, quarterly earnings for S&P; 500 components are now expected to fall 1.7 percent from a year ago. With 14 percent of S&P; companies having reported results so far, 64 percent have beaten Wall Street’s earnings expectations - less than the 67 percent average for the past four quarters. Apollo Group Inc shares plummeted 20 percent to $21.99 as the S&P; 500’s biggest decliner a day after the company, the owner of the largest for-profit college in the United States, gave a weak 2013 outlook.

366,INTC,Intel's outlook fails to inspire hopes for PC recovery,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp’s weak outlook for fourth-quarter revenue and margins dispelled lingering hopes for a revival in PC demand towards the end of the year, pushing its shares 2 percent lower. Intel, along with rival Advanced Micro Devices, had previously warned of weak demand for PCs, hit by a troubled global economy and the growing popularity of tablets like Apple Inc’s iPad, once dismissed as a niche device but now leading a fundamental shift in consumer computing. Intel’s corporate-focused server and data center business has helped offset weak PC sales in recent quarters, but in the third quarter, revenue from that division also disappointed as enterprises bought fewer servers. “You have to remember, data center has been the rock we’ve all leaned on,” said Patrick Wang, an analyst at Evercore Partners. “It’s a reflection of enterprises and companies rationalizing their year-end spend.” With economic growth slowing in China and struggling in Europe and the United States, global PC shipments are expected by analysts to decline slightly this year, the first annual drop since 2001. Intel said the data center business, which sells server chips and other equipment to companies and governments, grew 6 percent year over year in the third quarter, although it was down 5 percent from the prior quarter. Profitability will also take a hit, as Intel idles excess capacity at its plants in an effort to reduce inventories of its processors. It foresees fourth-quarter gross margins of 57 percent, or 58 percent on a non-GAAP basis, both plus or minus a couple of percentage points. Analysts on average expected gross margins of about 62 percent for the current quarter. Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said about two-thirds of the anticipated decline in margins will come from excess capacity charges. Intel is also running its factories at less than 50 percent of their capacity, redirecting unused space and equipment to be used on more cutting-edge production lines still being built. To inject new life into PCs, Intel has been promoting a new category of thin, “Ultrabook” laptops with touch screens enabled by Microsoft’s upcoming Windows 8. But the Ultrabooks launched so far have been criticized as too expensive, and manufacturers have shipped fewer than expected. “I absolutely expect growth in the PC segment, and I firmly believe that the level of innovation we’re seeing in Ultrabooks is going to be one of the catalysts,” Smith told Reuters in a telephone interview. “I’m not going to put a number out there -but I expect it to grow.” Shares of Intel fell to $22.35 in after hours trade, after closing up 2.85 percent at $22.35. The world’s leading chipmaker is used to being king of the personal computer market, particularly through its historic “Wintel” alliance with Microsoft Corp, which led to breathtakingly high profit margins and an 80 percent market share. But in the fast-growing and cut-throat mobile world, Intel is struggling - its market share is less than 1 percent of smartphones, trailing Qualcomm Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, ARM Holdings Plc and others. That leaves some investors, already concerned about a lackluster global economy, asking if Intel’s invincibility has come to an end, and whether its profit and revenue growth potential may come back down to earth. The PC industry has been banking on Microsoft’s launch of Windows 8 later in October to breathe new life into laptops and slow the trend of consumers buying smartphones and tablets instead of PCs. But there has been little sign of a significant bump in PC manufacturing or shipments ahead of the launch, at least in the short-term, analysts say. Intel estimated fourth-quarter revenue of $13.6 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts expected $13.74 billion for the current quarter. In the third quarter, Intel’s revenue was $13.5 billion, compared with $14.2 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected $13.23 billion in revenue for the third quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net earnings were $2.97 billion, or 58 cents a share, compared with $3.47 billion, or 65 cents a share in the same quarter last year.

Homebuilders climbed after data showed groundbreaking on new homes jumped 15 percent in September, the quickest pace since July 2008 and a sign the housing sector was supporting the  economy. Both Intel Corp and IBM tumbled a day after they reported results, keeping the Dow negative. IBM alone caused a 66-point drag on the blue chip average. Intel gave a weak fourth-quarter revenue outlook while IBM posted third-quarter revenue that came in under expectations. Intel dropped 2.7 percent to $21.75 while IBM lost 4.3 percent to $201.85. Both were among the biggest drags on the Dow and Nasdaq. Bank of America swung between small losses and small gains in heavy, volatile trading after it said per-share earnings were break-even and down sharply compared with the previous year. But M&T; Bank jumped 5 percent to $102.27 after posting third-quarter results, helping to lift the KBW Bank index 1.2 percent. Earnings among financial stocks have yielded mixed results thus far. Earlier this week, results from Citigroup and Goldman Sachs indicated improvement in the group, though those reports followed disappointments from JPMorgan Chase  and Wells Fargo. “It seems like it’s a classic earnings period reaction. Either people are too exuberant and expectations are raised too high to beat when the actual number comes out or people are too pessimistic and the earnings are just not as low,” said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in New York. After the housing starts report the PHLX housing index  rose 3.5 percent, led by a 4.9 percent climb in DR Horton Inc to $21.69. “The housing number gave people some confidence that maybe we are moving in the right direction economically, so it’s one of those days where the glass seems half full more than half empty.” said Meckler. The S&P; just notched its best two-day advance in a month, a rise of 1.8 percent, on the heels of its worst weekly decline in four months. Expectations for a disappointing earnings season, which prompted the decline, have been dampened this week as more companies post quarterly results. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 11.98 points, or 0.09 percent, to 13,539.80. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 4.14 points, or 0.28 percent, to 1,459.06.

U.S. and German government debt prices fell after Spain avoided a damaging ratings downgrade from Moody’s and stronger-than-expected U.S. housing data pointed to an improving economy,  which reduced safe-haven demand. Growing speculation that Spain will ask for a bailout next month lifted the euro. A possible line of credit to Spain and some easing of German opposition to aid for Greece and Spain were also likely to support the euro in the near term. Wall Street opened mixed, with the Dow pulled lower by Intel and IBM. But the Nasdaq rebounded to climb higher, building on the best two-day advance for U.S. stocks in a month.

The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index of top European shares gained just 0.4 percent to 1,117.77.

The euro was up 0.5 percent at $1.3117, its highest since mid-September.

374,INTC,UPDATE 4-Chipmaker AMD announces layoffs as PC sales stumble,"* Revenue forecast falls short of expectations * AMD struggles with slow PC industry, lack of mobile * Targets $1.3 billion quarterly break-even point By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 18 (Reuters) - PC chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices said on Thursday it will cut its work force of nearly 12,000 by 15 percent, its second round of layoffs in less than a year as it struggles with a weak global economy and a consumer shift toward tablets. The chipmaker forecast a drop in fourth-quarter revenue that is worse than Wall Street expected, and Chief Executive Rory Read said he does not expect the PC industry to improve for “several” quarters. AMD, which is a distant No. 2 to top chipmaker Intel Corp,  said in a statement it expects its restructuring actions, which will also include site consolidations, to result in operational savings of $190 million next year. It expects to record a restructuring expense in the fourth quarter of about $80 million. “It’ll bring earnings up, I guess, but you still have to ask how disruptive this will be and what roles are they cutting,” said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Bernstein Research. “The market is not going their way, and they’re not in a strong position.” Last week, AMD warned that its third-quarter revenue fell more than it had previously expected and that gross margins suffered from a $100 million writedown due to lower future growth of some products. AMD said it has set a target for a quarterly $1.3 billion revenue break-even point. Read took over at AMD last year promising to fix long-standing execution problems that have plagued the chipmaker. But AMD has continued to lose money as well as market share to Intel and graphic chip rival Nvidia. “The trends we knew would re-shape the industry are happening at a much faster pace than we anticipated,” Read told analysts on a conference call. Looking for markets with faster growth than PCs, AMD said it plans to increase its focus on selling chips for communications, industrial and gaming applications. Read said those areas will grow to account for 20 percent of quarterly revenue by the fourth quarter of next year compared with 5 percent now. FLAT-FOOTED Like Intel, Sunnyvale, California-based AMD was caught flat-footed in recent years with the emergence and fast growth of mobile devices like Apple’s iPad. Tablets and smartphones, once considered a niche market by Intel and others, are quickly gaining favor with consumers and eating into sales of laptops and desktop computers, while a slowing global economy is dampening spending in general. One of Read’s first major moves was to announce a plan last November to slash 10 percent of AMD’s workforce to save about $200 million in operating costs. AMD and Intel have been slow to adapt their PC chip designs to mobile. But while Intel has poured its massive resources into efforts to catch up to smartphone chipmakers like Qualcomm, AMD has yet to define a clear mobile strategy. Shares of AMD have fallen 43 percent over the past year to levels last seen in 2009. AMD posted third-quarter revenue of $1.27 billion, down from $1.69 billion a year ago, and a net loss of $157 million, or 21 cents a share, compared with a year ago profit of $97 million, or 13 cents a share. Analysts had expected AMD to post $1.28 billion in revenue for the third quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. AMD estimated fourth-quarter revenue would fall 9 percent from the third quarter, plus or minus 4 percent. AMD’s fourth-quarter revenue forecast translates into a range of $1.116 billion to $1.196 billion. Analysts on average expected $1.33 billion. “The guide is actually surprisingly weak, it shows that AMD still has issues to deal with in the near term,” said Patrick Wang, an analyst at Evercore Partners.

377,INTC,"Mobile revolution, economy trip up tech giants","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Mobile may be the future for technology, but even with the worldwide proliferation of high-powered devices like smartphones and tablets, some companies are struggling to maintain consistent revenue streams. Earnings disappointments this week from Intel Corp, Microsoft Corp, Google Inc and AMD underscore how Silicon Valley, both the old guard and new, is struggling to profit from consumers’ waning love affair with the stalwart PC and infatuation with mobile — the most significant tectonic shift in the industry since the advent of the Internet. That bodes ill for companies reporting next week that are highly leveraged to mobile advertising and services — most famously Facebook Inc, which raised a tumult by warning about over-inflated expectations of its mobile business just before its seminal IPO. Amazon and Apple Inc are expected to fare better, analysts say. Apple, which reports Thursday, is struggling with capacity constraints and supply hiccups — but analysts contend that’s a good problem to have because it’s spurred by raging mobile hardware demand. Amazon and eBay Inc, meanwhile, are succeeding in reaching consumers through mobile devices, particularly Amazon with its cut-rate Kindle Fire tablets. About 800,000 shoppers made their first-ever eBay purchase through a mobile device. But others are struggling. “Companies are realizing that it is not easy to find a formula that works with mobile,” Gartner analyst Carolina Milanesi said. “Mobile is not proving to be as straightforward as people thought.” Signs that some of the most innovative of today’s Silicon Valley titans are struggling with how to make money off mobile users come at a bad time for an industry already struggling with a worsening macroeconomic environment. The biggest stunner was perhaps Google, which shed more than $20 billion of market value after it reported that its core advertising business had slowed. Critics said it was no anomaly. “Click prices declined for the fourth consecutive quarter after rising for eight consecutive quarters before then. That’s a negative. This is the mobile problem,” said BGC analyst Colin Gillis. Then there is Zynga, the poster child for mobile transition woes. In 2011 the casual games maker was a consumer Internet darling. In 2012, it has cut its outlook twice and lost three-quarters of its market value amid a lack of mobile hits, leading analysts to warn of massive layoffs. Google CEO Larry Page, however, argued the shift represented a long-term opportunity. “We’re really starting to live in a new reality,” he told analysts on a conference call. “It will create a huge new universe of opportunities for advertisers, where they ... will be dynamically adapting across a whole bunch of different devices, to reach the right audiences at the right time.” Internet companies in China, the world’s largest Internet market by number of users, are also struggling to make money from those who access the Internet from mobile devices. Top China search engine Baidu Inc saw its shares tumble last week after Credit Suisse downgraded it to “underperform” on concerns about its money-making plans. At the end of June, the number of Chinese users accessing the Internet from mobile phones surpassed those accessing the Internet via personal computer. Because of this trend, many Chinese Internet companies such as social-networking and online games firm Tencent Holdings have upped their mobile Internet offerings in order to capture growth. “If you look at the evolution of mobile Internet, social networking is usually the first to spread around the world, followed by games and then advertising,” said Elinor Leung of CLSA. “You have stages to mobile Internet development, but eventually everyone will be there”. Perhaps hardest-hit are Intel and others closely tied to the PC chain. Intel’s weak outlook for the fourth quarter ended any hopes the PC market would pick up at year’s end. While Intel dominated that space in its prime, in smartphones its market share is less than 1 percent. Intel’s one-time rival AMD is in even worse shape, saying this week it will cut 15 percent of its staff — more than 1,600 people — as part of yet another restructuring to cut costs while it tries to figure out its future. On Thursday, Microsoft revealed a 22 percent dive in quarterly profit as sales of computers running its Windows operating system dipped. Marvell, yet another chipmaker being battered by the lagging PC market, on Thursday cut its revenue outlook by as much as 10 percent as its customers in the storage business suffered. Those doing best are the one with an established foothold in mobile, having figured it out years earlier. Verizon Communications posted a record quarterly profit on the strength of the wireless business it co-owns, which came largely from demand for the iPhone. Apple’s ubiquitous handset even figured in the blockbuster $20 billion purchase of a majority in Sprint Nextel Corp by Softbank Corp. Softbank, the first to offer the phone in Japan, was said to admire Sprint’s efforts to bring the device to its own network. The memory maker SanDisk also easily beat expectations for the third quarter, as demand for chips to be used in smartphones and tablets drove up pricing. If technology companies only had to deal with a platform transition, that would be one thing. The problem is they are struggling with that transition in the face of a weak economy, when technology upgrades are often the first budget line item to be cut and consumer spending crumbles. “It seems like the macro conditions certainly deteriorated in the third month, and no tech company will be immune to it,” said Trip Chowdhry, analyst at Global Equities Research.

379,INTC,"Intel, HP tout newest Itanium server technology","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel and Hewlett-Packard Co unveiled new server technology based on the high-end niche Itanium processors at the center of a recent dispute between Hewlett-Packard and Oracle Corp. The future of servers built with Itanium chips was thrown into doubt last year due to a bitter legal battle between long-time partners HP and Oracle and it remains unclear to some experts even after a California state court judge ruled in favor of HP. Intel and HP held a news conference on Thursday announcing the availability of the newest version of Itanium and introducing new HP servers using the chips. HP will keep offering its customers choices between servers based on heavy-duty Itanium chips and Intel’s more widely used “x86” chips, said Ric Lewis, vice president and interim general manager of HP’s Business Critical Systems. Rory McInerney, vice president of Intel’s architecture group said that future Itanium chips would be built using some of the key features found in the company’s more widely used Xeon server processors. He did not say when future chips would be released. Once envisioned as a high-end processor that could become pervasive across the server industry, Itanium suffered a series of setbacks and was eventually overtaken by 64-bit chips based on Intel’s x86 architecture, which is now widely used in the PC industry. Software created for x86 servers is not compatible with Itanium servers, which are mostly sold by HP. In August, a California state court judge ruled in favor of HP and against Oracle over the latter’s decision to end support for servers HP makes using Itanium chips. Oracle has since said it would support Itanium servers. The dispute began after Oracle bought Sun Microsystems, which put Oracle into the server hardware business in competition against its partner, HP. Oracle had said it would no longer make new versions of its database software compatible with Itanium servers because the chip family was nearing the end of its life. Asked about the long-term viability of Itanium chips in an industry where x86 is dominant, Intel’s McInerney said, “I think that whole thing was litigated and I think the message back is that Oracle is supporting Itanium.” Codenamed Paulson, the new Itanium 9500 has up to 2.4 times the performance of the previous generation, has twice as many cores and consumes less power, McInerney said. HP’s Itanium-based servers are mostly used by large corporations with rigorous computing needs.

Details of the talks were not known, but Sharp, whose displays are used in Apple Inc’s iPads and iPhones, is looking to small displays to spark a revival in its fortunes and sees the new generation of high-end laptops as a fresh market. Intel, which has been promoting a new category of thin “Ultrabook” laptops with touch screens, has long been interested in Sharp’s power-saving IGZO displays, as it responds to a shift from PCs to smartphones and tablets. Sharp may reach an agreement as early as the end of this month with Qualcomm, said one of the sources, who asked not to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to the media, adding talks with Intel are less concrete amid the chipmaker’s unclear financial picture. Shares in Sharp jumped 11 percent on the news, but brokers said the rally was likely to be brief as the potential investment would do little to address the firm’s fundamental problems as it struggles with a TV business in retreat, aggressive competition and a $13.8 billion debt load, according to Thomson Reuters data. “Sharp has talked about cutting debt and inventory, but they haven’t made it clear how they plan to generate cash flow and strengthen their capital base,” said Toshiyuki Kanayama, senior market analyst at Monex Inc. Japan’s top LCD maker has been in talks for months with Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, which is considering becoming the century-old Japanese firm’s biggest shareholder, but has said it is looking at other alliances as well. A Sharp spokeswoman said no decisions have been made about accepting investments from other companies, while an Intel official declined to comment. Qualcomm officials were unable to immediately comment. The Osaka-based firm, which has lost three-quarters of its value so far in 2012, nearly doubled its forecast full-year net loss to 450 billion yen ($5.7 billion) earlier this month after booking a $1.1 billion restructuring charge in July-September. Effectively shunned by the debt capital markets because of its massive losses and falling market share, Sharp received a guarantee for 360 billion yen in loans from its two main lenders, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ and Mizuho Corporate Bank, in September.

392,INTC,Intel CEO to retire as chipmaker struggles with mobile,"SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Intel Corp’s Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini will retire sooner than expected and the top chipmaker said it may name an outsider for the position for the first time to steer a difficult transition toward mobile computing. Intel, which has selected chief executives from within its own ranks throughout its 45-year history, said it would consider both internal and external candidates in a transition expected to last six months. Otellini will retire in May at the age of 62, earlier than the company’s mandatory retirement age for CEOs of 65. Intel’s fifth chief executive, Otellini has worked at the company for nearly 40 years and became CEO in 2005. Intel’s board was surprised last week when Otellini announced he planned to retire and it tried to get Otellini to stay, Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said. Some Wall Street analysts said it might make sense for Intel to consider hiring an outsider to shake up its strategy as the computing world goes through its most significant shift since the advent of the Internet. But internal candidates will have a leg up over potential outside contenders because of Intel’s size, complexity and engineer-driven culture, Mulloy said. “For any company of the size and complexity of Intel, an internal candidate would have a natural advantage,” he said. However, Mulloy added: “Good corporate governance dictates today you should look inside and out.” Intel, whose processors are dominant in personal computers, has been slow to expand into the fast-growing mobile industry, where Apple Inc’s iPads and iPhones and other popular mobile devices use competing technology from Britain’s ARM Holdings Plc. “We all know that everyone is using smartphones and tablets now. It’s the era of Intel versus ARM, so it may be good to come in with some fresh blood and a new perspective,” Evercore analyst Patrick Wang said. Intel said it was promoting three executives to become executive vice presidents: Renee James, who is in charge of Intel software; Brian Krzanich, who is chief operating officer and oversees manufacturing; and Stacy Smith, chief financial officer and director of corporate strategy. Smith, well-known by Wall Street, and Krzanich have in the past been viewed as potential CEOs. “There is a comfort level with Stacy (Smith),” said Williams Financial analyst Cody Acree. Krzanich, a three-decade Intel veteran, made a name for himself improving the efficiency of the chipmaker’s cutting-edge factories. He was promoted to chief operating officer last March, effectively throwing him in the running for the post of CEO. Analysts said James’ focus on software instead of hardware made her less likely to be promoted to CEO. Bryant pointed to Krzanich, Smith and James, as well as Intel Capital head Arvind Sodhani and Dadi Perlmutter, head of Intel’s push into mobile, as important executives for Intel’s future, according to Barron’s. Since it was founded in 1968, Intel has promoted CEOs from within. But the increasing belief that the “PC era,” which Intel helped create, may be drawing to a close could explain Intel’s willingness to look for outside candidates, analysts said. “Previous CEO transitions have all involved carefully groomed internal candidates. But if Intel’s board is now looking externally — to bring in new skills — that would explain the lack of a named successor and length of time in transition,” said Longbow Research analyst JoAnne Feeney. Intel’s board may have trouble finding an outsider with the strategic vision to lead it into the mobile market as well as the chops to run the cutting-edge factories that give the chipmaker a technological lead over its competitors. Since most other chipmakers have closed down their fabrication plants over the past two decades and outsourced production overseas, few executives have experience planning and running plants that now cost upwards of $10 billion each to build. Armed with a bachelor’s degree in economics and an MBA from the University of California, Otellini began at Intel in 1974, when most of the company’s sales came from memory chips and before it turned to PC processors. He managed several business units before being appointed chief operating officer in 2002. With economic growth slowing in China and struggling in Europe and the United States, global PC shipments are expected to decline slightly this year, the first annual drop since 2001. The top chipmaker is currently running its factories at less than 50 percent of capacity, redirecting unused space and equipment to be used for more cutting-edge production lines still being built. The Santa Clara, California-based company has long been king of the PC chip market, particularly through its historic “Wintel” alliance with Microsoft Corp, which led to breathtakingly high profit margins and an 80 percent market share. But it has struggled to adapt its powerful PC processors for battery-powered smartphones and tablets. Its market share for smartphones is less than 1 percent, trailing Qualcomm Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, ARM Holdings Plc and others. That leads some investors, already concerned about a lackluster global economy, to ask if Intel’s supremacy has come to an end and whether the company’s potential for profit and revenue growth may be limited. Intel’s shares closed up 0.3 percent at $20.25 in Nasdaq trading on Monday. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Intel’s smaller rival in PC processors, rose 3.22 percent to $1.92.

Baker SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Intel Corp  said on Monday that Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini will retire in May as the world’s leading chipmaker grapples with weak PC demand and an industry shift toward mobile computing. Intel’s board said it would consider internal and external candidates for the CEO position and it expected the “leadership transition” to last six months. Intel, whose processors are dominant in personal computers, has been slow to expand into the fast-growing mobile industry where Apple’s iPads and iPhones, and other popular mobile devices, are made using competing technology from Britain’s ARM Holdings. “We all know that everyone is using smartphones and tablets now.

Otellini, 62, was the company’s fifth CEO, stepping into the post in the second quarter of 2005. The company has an internal rule of retiring its CEOs at age 65.

Its market share is less than 1 percent of smartphones, trailing Qualcomm Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, ARM Holdings Plc and others.

401,INTC,Analysis: Intel Inside - Looking inward for CEO may be best bet,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Wanted: Visionary CEO to help world-class chipmaker expand beyond struggling personal computer market into tablets and smartphones. Experience with cutting-edge manufacturing plants and $10 billion annual capital expenditures a plus. Intel Corp raised eyebrows on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley this week when it said it will consider an outsider to take over from outgoing Chief Executive Paul Otellini, potentially ending a four-decade tradition of internal succession. Some analysts took that as a sign the top global chipmaker might be considering a transformative hire. Intel came under fire during Otellini’s tenure for missing out on the mobile revolution, insisting that emerging markets would prop up growth while underestimating the scale of the eventual drop-off in personal computer demand, and orchestrating a push on “Ultrabook” laptops that have so far failed to excite consumers. A future leader not steeped in Intel’s insular culture could potentially open the chipmaker’s prized factories for the first time to outside customers like Apple Inc or pursue other new strategies to expand into tablets and smartphones, said analyst Nathan Brookwood of Insight 64, a consulting firm. But any investor hoping Intel will hire an outsider with a dramatic solution to the top chipmaker’s PC plight may be out of luck, experts say. While the idea of an iconic visionary like Steve Jobs stepping in to lift Intel into the mobile market - its Achilles heel - may sound attractive, it could open the chipmaker to new risks should it waver from its traditional focus on hard-core manufacturing. Gurus with the experience to run a company with $53 billion a year in sales, a $10 billion capital spending budget and cutting-edge chip manufacturing plants are few and far between - and even rarer outside of Intel, which is struggling with falling PC sales and meager progress in mobile computing. “If you bring someone in who hasn’t run chip companies it’s going to be very difficult because Intel is somewhat unique,” said Patrick Henry, CEO of Entropic Communications, which makes chips for home entertainment. “It would probably surprise me if they didn’t hire one of the internal guys.” Silicon Valley peer Hewlett-Packard Co exemplifies the risks of a poorly thought-out external hire, recruiters and analysts say. During his tumultuous 11-month tenure, former software CEO Leo Apotheker engineered the widely panned $11 billion acquisition of Autonomy, which HP accused this week of accounting wrongdoing enroute to swallowing an $8.8 billion charge. [ID:nL4N0902ZH] He also presided over several quarters of lackluster financial results. “I don’t think (Intel) needs a 180-degree transformation. You don’t want somebody like a Leo Apotheker coming on and being your complete undoing,” said JMP analyst Alex Gauna. “Because of how badly things have gone for HP, the most probable scenario for (Intel) at the end of all this in May is that it looks very much the same.” But Mel Connet, a tech industry executive recruiter at Heritage Search Partners in Menlo Park, California, said Intel’s culture needs a shakeup that justifies looking for an outside candidate, while being mindful of the HP example. “My only advice would be not to use the same search firm that HP used,” said Connet, whose firm has not been contracted by Intel for its search. Chief Operating Officer Brian Krzanich, who is Intel’s manufacturing guru, is frequently mentioned by Intel employees as a strong contender to become CEO, partly because manufacturing is at the heart of Intel and previous chief executives have been promoted from the COO position. Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith is well known by financial analysts and many favor him, believing he is the best bet for keeping Intel stable. The company’s other executive vice presidents are Renee James, who is in charge of Intel software; Intel Capital head Arvind Sodhani; and Dadi Perlmutter, head of Intel’s push into mobile. They are well respected but are mentioned less often as potential picks. Sanford Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said a CEO hired from the ranks would have instant credibility among the company’s tight-knit workforce, which includes over 4,000 PhDs. “There’s no silver bullet. The issue here is not any sort of miss-execution on their part,” said Rasgon. “Their market is changing beneath their feet.” Otellini’s decision to retire, announced Monday, caught the board unprepared to replace him, Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy has said. All of Intel’s previous CEO successions were planned long in advance, leaving no room for instability. While Intel said it would include external candidates in its search for a new CEO, it also announced the promotion of Krzanich, Smith and James to executive vice presidents, suggesting that they remain serious potential candidates. Mulloy has said Intel veterans will have a natural advantage in winning the CEO position because they are familiar with the company’s manufacturing-intensive business model and insular, engineering culture. The Santa Clara, California-based company has long been king of PC chips, particularly through its historic “Wintel” alliance with Microsoft Corp, which led to breathtakingly high profit margins and an 80 percent market share. Its cutting-edge fabrication plants are the envy of rivals like Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), and helped it cement its leadership over decades. But more recently, Intel has struggled to adapt its powerful PC processors for battery-powered smartphones and tablets, and Wall Street increasingly worries the chipmaker may be left behind in the fast-growing mobile market. It has pinned its mobile hopes on its superior manufacturing technology, but that strategy has yet to pay off. To date Intel’s market share for smartphones is less than 1 percent, trailing Qualcomm Inc and Samsung. Since all but a handful of U.S. chipmakers have shuttered their fabrication plants in the past two decades and outsourced production overseas, few executives have experience planning and running advanced plants that cost nearly $10 billion each to build. “The perfect choice, which I don’t think exists right now, is somebody who can manage massive fabs - and also mobility. They don’t exist outside of Samsung, and that’s just not going to happen. There’s a culture clash,” said Patrick Moorhead, of Moor Insights & Strategy. Insight 64’s Brookwood believes a “Lou Gerstner-type” of executive with a fresh approach could shake up Intel but said such a candidate need not come from outside. Gerstner left RJR Nabisco to run International Business Machines Corp in 1993 and is widely seen as saving the struggling technology giant by focusing on IT services instead of products, in a radical shift. Intel believes its manufacturing strength is its key to succeeding in mobile computing, even if it takes a while for that strategy to pay off. Gauna said Intel’s future CEO should stick to that strategy, although it would be good for that person to have better ties to the mobile world as well as software companies seen as vital for tablets and smartphones. For example, Intel-based smartphones running the Android platform debuted just this year but could have been launched sooner had Otellini been more aggressive, Gauna said. “How they weave in the software strategy and the partnerships within the software and (manufacturing customer) marketplace - that’s where it gets really interesting,” Gauna said. “If I could paint a picture of what it needs to look like I’d put my hat in the ring myself.” ",11212012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-intel-ceo/analysis-intel-inside-looking-inward-for-ceo-may-be-best-bet-idUSBRE8AK1EI20121121

Gurus with the experience to run a company with $53 billion a year in sales, a $10 billion capital spending budget and cutting-edge chip manufacturing plants are few and far between - and even rarer outside of Intel, which is struggling with falling PC sales and meager progress in mobile computing. “If you bring someone in who hasn’t run chip companies it’s going to be very difficult because Intel is somewhat unique,” said Patrick Henry, CEO of Entropic Communications, which makes chips for home entertainment. “It would probably surprise me if they didn’t hire one of the internal guys.” Silicon Valley peer Hewlett-Packard Co exemplifies the risks of a poorly thought-out external hire, recruiters and analysts say. During his tumultuous 11-month tenure, former software CEO Leo Apotheker engineered the widely panned $11 billion acquisition of Autonomy, which HP accused this week of accounting wrongdoing enroute to swallowing an $8.8 billion charge. [ID:nL4N0902ZH] He also presided over several quarters of lackluster financial results. “I don’t think (Intel) needs a 180-degree transformation. You don’t want somebody like a Leo Apotheker coming on and being your complete undoing,” said JMP analyst Alex Gauna. “Because of how badly things have gone for HP, the most probable scenario for (Intel) at the end of all this in May is that it looks very much the same.” But Mel Connet, a tech industry executive recruiter at Heritage Search Partners in Menlo Park, California, said Intel’s culture needs a shakeup that justifies looking for an outside candidate, while being mindful of the HP example. “My only advice would be not to use the same search firm that HP used,” said Connet, whose firm has not been contracted by Intel for its search. Chief Operating Officer Brian Krzanich, who is Intel’s manufacturing guru, is frequently mentioned by Intel employees as a strong contender to become CEO, partly because manufacturing is at the heart of Intel and previous chief executives have been promoted from the COO position. Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith is well known by financial analysts and many favor him, believing he is the best bet for keeping Intel stable. The company’s other executive vice presidents are Renee James, who is in charge of Intel software; Intel Capital head Arvind Sodhani; and Dadi Perlmutter, head of Intel’s push into mobile. They are well respected but are mentioned less often as potential picks. Sanford Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said a CEO hired from the ranks would have instant credibility among the company’s tight-knit workforce, which includes over 4,000 PhDs. “There’s no silver bullet. The issue here is not any sort of miss-execution on their part,” said Rasgon. “Their market is changing beneath their feet.” Otellini’s decision to retire, announced Monday, caught the board unprepared to replace him, Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy has said. All of Intel’s previous CEO successions were planned long in advance, leaving no room for instability. While Intel said it would include external candidates in its search for a new CEO, it also announced the promotion of Krzanich, Smith and James to executive vice presidents, suggesting that they remain serious potential candidates. Mulloy has said Intel veterans will have a natural advantage in winning the CEO position because they are familiar with the company’s manufacturing-intensive business model and insular, engineering culture. The Santa Clara, California-based company has long been king of PC chips, particularly through its historic “Wintel” alliance with Microsoft Corp, which led to breathtakingly high profit margins and an 80 percent market share. Its cutting-edge fabrication plants are the envy of rivals like Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), and helped it cement its leadership over decades. But more recently, Intel has struggled to adapt its powerful PC processors for battery-powered smartphones and tablets, and Wall Street increasingly worries the chipmaker may be left behind in the fast-growing mobile market. It has pinned its mobile hopes on its superior manufacturing technology, but that strategy has yet to pay off. To date Intel’s market share for smartphones is less than 1 percent, trailing Qualcomm Inc and Samsung. Since all but a handful of U.S. chipmakers have shuttered their fabrication plants in the past two decades and outsourced production overseas, few executives have experience planning and running advanced plants that cost nearly $10 billion each to build. “The perfect choice, which I don’t think exists right now, is somebody who can manage massive fabs - and also mobility. They don’t exist outside of Samsung, and that’s just not going to happen. There’s a culture clash,” said Patrick Moorhead, of Moor Insights & Strategy. Insight 64’s Brookwood believes a “Lou Gerstner-type” of executive with a fresh approach could shake up Intel but said such a candidate need not come from outside. Gerstner left RJR Nabisco to run International Business Machines Corp in 1993 and is widely seen as saving the struggling technology giant by focusing on IT services instead of products, in a radical shift. Intel believes its manufacturing strength is its key to succeeding in mobile computing, even if it takes a while for that strategy to pay off. Gauna said Intel’s future CEO should stick to that strategy, although it would be good for that person to have better ties to the mobile world as well as software companies seen as vital for tablets and smartphones. For example, Intel-based smartphones running the Android platform debuted just this year but could have been launched sooner had Otellini been more aggressive, Gauna said. “How they weave in the software strategy and the partnerships within the software and (manufacturing customer) marketplace - that’s where it gets really interesting,” Gauna said. “If I could paint a picture of what it needs to look like I’d put my hat in the ring myself.” ",11222012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-intel-ceo/analysis-intel-inside-looking-inward-for-ceo-may-be-best-bet-idUSBRE8AK1EI20121122
403,INTC,"Intel sells debt, shares jump on stock buyback hopes","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp shares jumped more than 2 percent on Tuesday as the top chipmaker sold $6 billion in bonds to fund stock buybacks and other business activities. Intel sold the bonds in a range of maturities from five years to 30 years, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters unit. The Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker said in a filing it plans to use proceeds of the debt sale for general corporate purposes and for stock buybacks under its existing share authorization. “We believe the action should likely prove prudent given low debt borrowing costs,” RBC analyst Doug Freedman said of the debt offer in a note to clients. “In our view the raise will likely support increased buybacks.” Intel’s stock has dropped 18 percent over the past year as investors worried about slow PC sales and the company’s failure to expand into mobile gadgets. In the September quarter, Intel spent $1.165 billion on stock buybacks, bringing its repurchases so far in 2012 to $3.765 billion. At the end of that quarter, Intel had another $6.3 billion available for share repurchases under its existing authorization. Some investors have pointed to Intel’s willingness to return cash to investors as a reason to own its stock. It paid $1.1 billion in dividends in the third quarter and its dividend yield stands at about 4.3 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Intel shares rose 2.19 percent on Tuesday to settle at $19.97. “The cost of money is relatively inexpensive and we have an excellent credit rating.

408,INTC,Intel CEO Otellini expects insider to replace him,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel’s outgoing chief executive, Paul Otellini, said he expected to be replaced by a company insider and also signaled that the top chipmaker could open its factories to strategic customers. Otellini’s comments at a Sanford Bernstein investor conference on Wednesday stoked speculation the top chipmaker may manufacture mobile chips for Apple and pushed Intel’s shares higher on Thursday morning. “For the right types of products and not to enable my competitors, I would certainly consider it. There’s a lot of stuff in the pipeline,” Otellini said, according to a Thomson One transcript. “As you know it takes a while to move your designs over, to design them under our process, for us to be able to bring them in-house and so forth and our foundry customers aren’t going to announce that they’ve moved until they’ve moved because it would hurt them at their current suppliers, Otellini said. RBC analyst Doug Freedman said Otellini’s comments about the possibility of open Intel’s plants to customers were more direct than previous ones. Apple currently depends on Samsung Electronics to manufacture its mobile chips but the two companies are in a war over patents and also compete in smarpthones and tablets. Apple is believed to be looking for alternative suppliers. Intel raised eyebrows on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley in November when it said it will consider an outsider to take over after Otellini unexpectedly announced he will retire in May, potentially ending a four-decade tradition of internal succession. Some analysts took that as a sign that Intel, which has struggled to jump from the personal computer market to mobile, might be considering a transformative hire. But Otellini he expects the board to choose from among the chipmaker’s own executives. “It’s not up to me but I think that’s the most likely outcome.

412,INTC,Sprint in talks with major Clearwire investors: sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sprint Nextel Corp (S.N) is in talks with Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) to buy out their stakes in the U.S. wireless provider Clearwire Corp CLWR.O, two people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. The No. 3 U.S. cellular company, which owns just over 50 percent in Clearwire, would still need buy out the rest of the minority shareholders in Clearwire to gain full ownership. Intel and Comcast own a combined basis roughly 12.4 percent of Clearwire’s total shares outstanding, including publicly traded stock and Class B shares, according to a Clearwire filing. Some minority Clearwire shareholders have publicly expressed concerns over a potential deal with Sprint, suggesting that Clearwire should look at other options. Those shareholders include Mount Kellet Capital Management LP - the No. 2 holder of Clearwire’s public shares with a 7.7 percent stake - and another top shareholder, Crest Financial Limited, which owns almost 7 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Clearwire shares rose almost 12 percent on Tuesday after a CNBC report that Clearwire’s majority shareholder, Sprint, was moving closer to a deal to buy the rest of the company. Citing unnamed people close to the situation, CNBC said Sprint was in discussions to buy the 49 percent of Clearwire it does not already own and that a deal might be announced before the end of the year. Sprint, which wants full ownership of Clearwire’s wireless spectrum, has been in continuing negotiations with the company, but it is in no rush to finalize a deal, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters. Consolidating the two companies’ balance sheets could risk delaying the closing of Sprint’s $20.1 billion deal with Softbank, a separate source close to the matter said. While the timing of a Clearwire takeover is unclear, it had been planned for around the middle of next year, one of the people had said. The people requested anonymity because the matter is not public. Sprint, Clearwire, Intel and Comcast all declined to comment. Clearwire, whose biggest customer is also Sprint, has been looking to raise new financing as it could run out of money by the end of the third quarter of 2013. Clearwire is also under pressure to move ahead with an upgrade of its network for high-speed wireless services. CNBC reported that Sprint had been in talks in recent days with other Clearwire shareholders, which include Bright House, Intel and Comcast, to buy their shares of the company at about $3.00 each. The report said that Sprint’s offer price for the 488 million shares that are held by the public remained unclear. Sprint has increased its ownership of Clearwire to 50.45 percent with the purchase of Eagle River Holdings’ stake, which closed on Tuesday. Clearwire shares closed up 11.67 percent at $2.68 on Nasdaq after the report, while Sprint fell 1.59 percent to $5.57.

414,INTC,"Intel launches microserver chips, gets nod from Facebook","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel launched a data-center chip using low-power technology found in smartphones, stepping up competition in the nascent microserver market and winning a nod from Facebook. The Atom chip rolled out on Tuesday uses much less electricity than Intel’s previous processors for servers and comes as Intel’s rivals also eye the low-power server niche. Energy-sipping chips similar to those used in smartphones and tablets lack the horsepower of traditional server processors made by Intel. But data centers that combine many low-power chips instead of just a few heavy-duty processors may provide more computing power for less money, and use less electricity. Microservers have yet to gain serious traction with traditional corporate customers like banks and manufacturers, and the potential size of the market remains unclear. But Internet giants like Facebook, Amazon.Com and Google have been experimenting with ways to use low-power chips to make their data centers more efficient. At an Intel event launching the Atom chips, a Facebook infrastructure executive said the social network has found that low-power chips excel at processing the 4.5 billion updates, likes, posts and comments its 1 billion active users add to the site every day. “We do face unprecedented scale at Facebook, and that’s one of the reasons we’re so highly motivated to figure out the most efficient way to scale infrastructure efficiently and support all the people using Facebook,” said Frank Frankovsky, Facebook’s VP of hardware design and supply chain. He did not say whether Facebook expects to buy Intel’s new chips. Frankovsky said “wimpy” low-power chips in some cases can do the same work as Intel’s “brawny” Xeon chips while consuming half or a third as much power. “How much useful work can you get done per watt per dollar? That’s the only metric that matters,” Frankovsky said. Intel dominates the PC and server markets, but was slow to design chips for the mobile market, where chips using technology from ARM Holdings have become ubiquitous.

Citing unnamed people close to the situation, CNBC said Sprint was in discussions to buy the 49 percent of Clearwire it does not already own and that a deal might be announced before the end of the year. Sprint, which wants full ownership of Clearwire’s wireless spectrum, has been in continuing negotiations with the company, but it is in no rush to finalize a deal, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters. Consolidating the two companies’ balance sheets could risk delaying the closing of Sprint’s $20.1 billion deal with Softbank, a separate source close to the matter said. While the timing of a Clearwire takeover is unclear, it had been planned for around the middle of next year, one of the people had said. The people requested anonymity because the matter is not public. Sprint, Clearwire, Intel and Comcast all declined to comment. Clearwire, whose biggest customer is also Sprint, has been looking to raise new financing as it could run out of money by the end of the third quarter of 2013. Clearwire is also under pressure to move ahead with an upgrade of its network for high-speed wireless services. CNBC reported that Sprint had been in talks in recent days with other Clearwire shareholders, which include Bright House, Intel and Comcast, to buy their shares of the company at about $3.00 each. The report said that Sprint’s offer price for the 488 million shares that are held by the public remained unclear. Sprint has increased its ownership of Clearwire to 50.45 percent with the purchase of Eagle River Holdings’ stake, which closed on Tuesday. Clearwire shares closed up 11.67 percent at $2.68 on Nasdaq after the report, while Sprint fell 1.59 percent to $5.57.

420,INTC,Intel bets big on thin PCs and phones at Las Vegas show,"LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Top chipmaker Intel Corp on Monday announced shipments of a new low-power chip and showed off next-generation ultra thin laptops and convertible tablets in its latest bid to prove that the struggling PC industry still has a bright future. At the 2013 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas , Intel said new energy-efficient processors for tablets and laptops are available now, and it outlined features like voice recognition and drastically improved battery life on future PCs. “Absolutely all-day battery life where you just don’t have to bring your power brick at all anymore,” Kirk Skaugen, corporate vice president and general manager of Intel’s PC Client Group, said of laptops built with the company’s upcoming Haswell processor. While macroeconomic troubles have weighed on sales for several quarters, the growing popularity of tablets and smartphones is seen as an existential threat to the PC industry. Anxious to breathe new life into PCs and prove a recent slump in sales is not permanent, Intel and PC manufactures in Las Vegas this week will display a range of ultra thin laptops, dubbed Ultrabooks, and hybrid devices that convert into tablets. On a stage flanked by dozens of tablets and laptops with rotatable and detachable screens, Skaugen said Intel’s newly available chip based on its current Ivy Bridge architecture sips just 7 watts of energy, more efficient than a previously planned 10 watts of power. NO-EXCUSES PHONE The Santa Clara, California-based company has long been king of the PC chip market, particularly through its historic “Wintel” alliance with Microsoft Corp, which led to breathtakingly high profit margins and an 80 percent market share. But it has struggled to adapt its powerful PC processors for battery-powered smartphones and tablets, a fast-growing market led by Qualcomm Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, ARM Holdings Plc and others. Mike Bell, who co-heads Intel’s mobile and wireless business, introduced a new processor platform, code named Lexington, targeted at low-priced smartphones in emerging markets like Latin America and Asia. “It’s designed to be a no-excuses multimedia phone,” he said. Acer, Safaricom and Lava have already agreed to use the new chips in future phones, Bell said. A handful of manufacturers and telecom carriers in Europe and Asia have already launched smartphones using Intel’s Medfield processors this year. Google’s Motorola Mobility in September launched the Razr i in Europe and Latin America as the first handset of a multi-device agreement between the two groups. But Intel is fighting an uphill battle in a market where chips made using technology from ARM Holdings have become ubiquitous. Intel also has yet to release a chip for 4G telephone networks, keeping it out of the running for major smartphone design wins in the United States. Sales of smartphone processors soared 58 percent in the third quarter, but Intel had just 0.2 percent of that market, according to a recent report from Strategy Analytics. By comparison, worldwide PC shipments fell 8.6 percent in the third quarter, according to IDC. Intel said 3D cameras would be integrated in future Ultrabooks to allow consumers to use gestures and facial recognition to control their devices. Upcoming Ultrabooks will also include voice interaction, Skaugen said. “We’re basically going to give the PC the same human senses we’ve all had,” he said. Intel and other tech companies are increasingly looking for ways to let PCs and other devices use cameras, GPS chips, microphones and other kinds of sensors to predict their users’ needs. “It’s this combination of computer devices doing things before you ask them to do it, in that they’re smart enough to know based on their sensors,” said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy.

423,INTC,PC titans take notes from tablets to regain customers,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Personal computer makers, trying to beat back a tablet mania that’s eating into their sales, are making what may be a last-ditch attempt to sway customers by mimicking the competition. Many of the laptops to be unveiled around the world in coming months will be hybrids or “convertibles” - morphing easily between portable tablets and full-powered laptops with a keyboard, industry analysts say. The wave of hybrids comes as Intel Corp and Microsoft Corp, long the twin leaders of the PC industry, prepare to report results this week and next. Wall Street is predicting flat to sluggish quarterly revenue growth for both, underscoring the plight of an industry that has struggled to innovate. In 2013, some are hoping that will change. With the release of Microsoft’s touch-centric, re-imagined Windows 8 platform in October and more power-efficient chips from Intel, PC makers are trying to spark growth by focusing on creating slim laptops with touchscreens that convert to tablets and vice versa. Microsoft, expanding beyond its traditional business of selling software, is expected this month to roll out a “Surface Pro” tablet compatible with legacy PC software developed over decades. That’s a major selling point for corporate customers like German business software maker SAP, which plans to buy Surface Pros for employees that want it, said SAP Chief Information Officer Oliver Bussmann. “The hybrid model is very compelling for a lot of users,” Bussmann told Reuters last week. “The iPad is not replacing the laptop. It’s hard to create content. That’s the niche that Microsoft is going after. The Surface can fill that gap.” Apple’s iPad began chipping away at demand for laptops in 2010, an assault that accelerated with the launch of Amazon.com Inc’s Kindle Fire and other Google Android devices like Samsung Electronics’ Note. With sales of PCs falling last year for the first time since 2001, this year may usher in a renaissance in design and innovation from manufacturers who previously focused on reducing costs instead of adding new features to entice consumers. “People used to be able to just show up at the party and do well just because the market was going up,” Lisa Su, a senior vice president at Advanced Micro Devices, which competes against Intel. “It’s harder now. You can’t just show up at the party. You have to innovate and have something special.” At last week’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, devices on display from Intel and others underscored the PC industry’s plan to bet more on convertible laptops. Lenovo’s North America President Gerry Smith told Reuters last week that over the holidays he sold out of the company’s “Yoga”, a laptop with a screen that flips back behind its keyboard, and the “ThinkPad Twist”, another lightweight laptop with a swiveling screen. Intel itself showed off a hybrid prototype laptop dubbed “North Cape”, housed in a thin tablet screen that attaches magnetically to a low-profile keyboard. And Asus showed a hefty 18-inch, all-in-one Windows 8 PC that converts to a tablet running Google’s Android operating system. Lenovo and Asus, which have both won positive reviews for their devices in recent months, increased their PC shipments by 14 percent and 17 percent respectively last year, according to Gartner. “The number of unique systems that our partners have developed for Windows has almost doubled since launch. That gives an indication of how much innovation is going into the PC market,” Tami Reller, chief financial officer of Microsoft’s Windows unit, told Reuters. FINGER-POINTING To be sure, hybrids with detachable or twistable screens do not yet account for a significant proportion of global PC sales, and consumers still need to be sold on their benefits. Previous attempts by PC makers to reinvigorate the market have had limited success. Pushed by Intel, manufacturers launched a series of slimmed down laptops early last year with features popular on tablets, like solid-state memory. They were too expensive, often at more than $1,000 apiece, and failed to arrest the PC decline. Microsoft’s Windows 8 launch in October brought touchscreen features but failed to spark a resurgence in PC sales many manufacturers had hoped for. A round of finger-pointing ensued, with PC and chip executives blaming a shortage of touchscreen components and others saying it was the manufacturers that sharply underestimated consumer demand for touch devices. Regardless, the entire PC ecosystem is onboard for 2013. Almost half of the Windows laptops rolled out this year may have touch screens. Of those, most will be in convertible form, according to IDC analyst David Daoud. Further blurring the distinction between kinds of devices, about a quarter of upcoming Windows 8 gadgets will be tablets that can easily act as laptops with the help of keyboard accessories, he added. But buyers may have to wait until the second half of the year to see many of them. “The most likely scenario today is for the industry to have these products ready for the back-to-school season,” Daoud said.

424,INTC,"Intel's weak outlook, spending hikes unnerve Wall Street","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp’s current-quarter revenue forecast disappointed Wall Street, while a sharp rise in planned 2013 capital spending unnerved investors who expect personal computer demand to dwindle. Shares of the world’s leading chipmaker slid more than 5 percent after it projected 2013 capital spending at $13 billion - plus or minus $500 million - exceeding many analysts’ estimates for about $10 billion. Intel said $2 billion of its increased spending would go toward expanding a facility for researching future manufacturing technology. But some analysts worried that expanding too quickly may create excess capacity that could hurt the bottom line if it has to idle plants. “People are starting to freak out about the capex,” said Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. “They are making the bet this year and hoping for a big revenue lift in 2014. If you think that PCs are not growing that much anymore, then what’s going to drive it?” “The concern is that if I spend a lot of money and I build up my factories, I don’t have enough demand to fill them, they have very high fixed costs, and it pulls your margins down,” Rasgon said. Outgoing Chief Executive Paul Otellini, who plans to retire in May after a successor is identified, said the investment in manufacturing would suppress costs in the long run. “The leading edge capacity is the lowest cost for us on a per unit basis,” Otellini told analysts on a conference call. “Regardless of what you think the size of the market is, the leading edge fabs are the single greatest asset that we have.” Otellini said the higher capex is not intended to bankroll a foundry or contract chipmaking business. But he did not rule out manufacturing semiconductors for other chip companies - as long as that did not empower a rival. In the fourth quarter, Intel’s revenue was $13.5 billion, compared with $13.9 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected $13.53 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter. It estimated first-quarter revenue of $12.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts expected $12.91 billion for the current quarter. Facing lower demand, Intel said in October it was running factories at less than half of their capacity. Intel is used to being king of the personal computer market, particularly through its historic Wintel alliance with Microsoft which has led to breathtakingly high profit margins and an 80 percent market share. But it has struggled to adapt its technology for smartphones and tablets, a market dominated by Qualcomm Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Nvidia Corp.

However, some Wall Street analysts gave Intel high marks for operating efficiency. “The revenue isn’t going to be there, but the margin and expense control is going to stabilize the bottom line,” said Cody Acree, an analyst at Williams Financial. “I think it’s probably a success if you can be flat in an industry that most people expect to be flat-to-down.” It foresees first-quarter gross margins of 58 percent, plus or minus two percentage points.

427,INTC,"Instant View: Intel revenue forecast falls short, capex swells","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp forecast current-quarter revenue that was slightly below expectations, as the personal computer industry grapples with falling sales and a fundamental shift in consumer preferences toward tablets and smartphones. Commentary “Intel needs to keep investing in new plants this year, even though revenue could be flat to down over the course of 2013, he said. “They have to continue to invest in new technologies. “I don’t think weakness is a buying opportunity. There are not enough catalysts to push revenues up.” “At $13 billon, the capex number implies that the PC business is fine, that they need that capacity. Given that PC business isn’t growing as much as before, you would have expected around a $10 billion type of range. The fact that we’re $3 billion above that has got to get some investors concerned about the possibility of excess capacity. “Which is why to me that number gives us confirmation that they’re planning to really ramp their foundry business this year. “A lot of folks had expected Intel to really be in line or even below. “Revenue guidance of kind of low single digits and GM guidance of 60 percent is about 100 bps higher than the street. “It means that we’re not going to continue to slide lower. PCs really degraded over the course of 2012, and the guidance and the numbers they giving us here probably means that we’ve hit the bottom, we’re seeing stability, and we should start to see some growth shortly. “We’ll see what happens. Intel has really not been all that accurate in their long-term forecasts. But it signifies that they feel more comfortable with the PC landscape.” “There seem to be a lot of investors who thought that Intel’s utilization rates would drop and that gross margins would go down with it. Seems like they’re managing through this downturn pretty well. “It seems like PCs were slightly lower than we expected. It seems like they slightly under-shipped the market. They’re up 7 percent in the more profitable server market. “First quarter seems like it’s going to be slightly lower than what the Street was anticipating, but we think again that’s weakness in PCs, and some in servers, in the first quarter. Looks like their guidance for the year is very strong with 60 percent gross margins — that would be up from 58 percent in Q1. “It seems like they’re positive and they think they’re going to grow in the low single digits. That’s because we think, in the second half of 2013, we expect to see growth in the PC market. “It’s the best tool in Intel’s toolbox: their manufacturing. “They’re going to push forward and that separates them from their competitors and allows them to come out with lower-power, higher-performance processors in the future. “Some of these new PCs that are coming out are innovative and can actually start taking back some high-end or $700 tablets. We think that if you get a full PC that is convertible to look like a tablet with touch, we think that’s a very compelling product. The results show that the “PC industry is still around and maybe it was slightly exaggerated that the death of the PC was here.” “The numbers are not worse than feared. “The Q4 beat looks like the tax rate. Gross margins came in slightly better than expected. With regard to the higher-than expected capital expenditure forecast, “this is a company that is continuing to spend money to participate in the market. That may concern some investors.” “The gross margin guidance is a little higher than people thought. That may be supporting the stock. “People are starting to freak out about the capex. “They are making the bet this year and hoping for a big revenue lift in 2014. If you think that PCs are not growing that much anymore, then what’s going to drive it? “The concern is that if I spend a lot of money and I build up my factories, I don’t have enough demand to fill them, they have very high fixed costs, and it pulls your margins down.” “The upside to EPS came from 4 points of better tax rate, so that’s not necessarily the best way to beat earnings. “The revenue outlook is light. The good thing is they are looking at pretty decent margins: a couple hundred basis points for the full year. The revenue isn’t going to be there, but the margin and expense control is going to stabilize the bottom line. “It’s probably a success if you can be flat in an industry that most people expect to be flat-to-down. But remember that is the expectation of flat. That is not the delivery of flat. “If they are able to be flat, that will be great, but it is probably going to be a challenge to be flat.” ",1172013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-intel-results-instant/instant-view-intel-revenue-forecast-falls-short-capex-swells-idUSBRE90G1BK20130117

431,INTC,Intel may have little choice in big manufacturing bet,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp’s decision to spend $13 billion in 2013 to develop and build future manufacturing technology has not gone down well on Wall Street but it may be necessary if it wants to stay on top of rivals in coming years. The top chipmaker’s shares slumped nearly 7 percent on Friday, a day after executives said the company would increase 2013 capital spending from an already dizzying $11 billion. Some analysts decried the move, saying adding new capacity should be far from Intel’s mind in a waning personal computer market. Increased spending may further pressure margins and leave Intel with even more idle capacity if PC sales keep falling. But others believe that Intel’s top priority must be maintaining its technological edge, a costly but necessary endeavor that may even pay off in the long run with market share gains. Moving up the technology ladder can also deliver cost savings, helping safeguarding Intel’s margins as it tries to catch up to rivals in smartphones and tablets. “That’s the bet they’re making and they’re all in,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. “If you stop, TSMC and Samsung close the gap - and you’re toast.” Of Intel’s $13 billion capex this year, $2 billion will go toward expanding a fabrication plant, or fab, in Oregon where engineers will work on a long-term plan to manufacture microchips on silicon wafers measuring 450 mm - about the size of a large pizza. The other $11 billion goes toward more immediate improvements in Intel’s manufacturing technology, letting it build chips over the next two or three years with features measuring just 14 nanometers, and then 10 nm. The narrower the features, the more transistors can fit on a single chip, improving performance. The newest fabs currently use 300 mm wafers, about the size of a vinyl record. Moving up in size will make room for more than twice as many chips to be etched on each, leading to cost savings. Lowering costs will be a serious priority for Intel as it ventures into the tablet and phone markets, where chips sell for much less than in the PC industry. Intel, which has yet to make meaningful progress in mobile, stresses that its most advanced fabs have the lowest cost per chip produced. “One of reasons why Intel is so aggressive on capital spending is to maximize the chances it has of protecting its gross margins as it moves into smaller and lower priced CPUs,” Longbow Research analyst JoAnne Feeney said. Intel is not the first tech company to worry Wall Street with aggressive long-term investments whose payoffs are difficult to estimate. Investors in the past have criticized Amazon.com Inc for splurging on costly warehouses and other shipping facilities, investments that eventually paid off and contributed to rich stock valuations. While the size of Intel’s capex increase alarmed investors, the chipmaker since 2011 has been spending heavily. Intel normally pours 12 to 16 percent of its revenue into capex, but spending has been closer to 20 percent in the past two years and will probably be higher this year, Feeney estimated. The costs of developing the new technology to use 450 mm fabs are so high that just a few companies, such as Intel, Samsung Electronics and Taiwan’s TSMC, are expected to have the scale to make the jump worthwhile. Building 450 mm plants from the ground up is expected to cost $10 billion or more. It’s not just a matter of creating bigger silicon wafers. Most of the high-tech equipment - sold by the likes of Applied Materials - used in chip manufacturing has to be redesigned as well. The transition from 300 mm to 450 mm is so expensive and complicated that the world’s biggest chipmakers and tool makers are collaborating to establish new standards and timing new technology. Intel made a $3 billion strategic equity investment last year in chip equipment supplier ASML to help fund the development of future lithography tools for 450 mm fabs, a move followed by rivals Samsung and TSMC. Intel’s Oregon plant will lead the effort to produce chips on 450 mm wafers, with other larger Intel plants upgraded in the future, Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told Reuters on Thursday. Rasgon said Intel’s long-term investments in manufacturing will mean more pressure on its margins over the next few years, but that its spending will help ensure it remains a major player in the chip industry over the next decade - though there’s no guarantee. “If there’s any company I can look at five years from now, they’ll be here and they’ll be really successful at whatever they’re doing. But I don’t know what they’ll look like,” Rasgon said. “They have to do this, but it doesn’t mean I want to own the stock while they’re doing it.” ",1182013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-intel-capex/intel-may-have-little-choice-in-big-manufacturing-bet-idUSBRE90H1A420130118

Still, the S&P; 500 was on track for a third week in a row of gains and remained near a five-year high. Shares of Intel Corp slumped 6.7 percent to $21.17 a day after it forecast quarterly revenue below analysts’ estimates and announced plans for increased capital spending amid slow demand for personal computers. On a positive note, Morgan Stanley reported a fourth-quarter profit after a year-earlier loss, helped by higher revenue at the bank’s institutional securities business. Its stock jumped 7.5 percent to $22.32. “Intel earnings weren’t that bad, although their revenue was weak. It sparks fears about not only the company but about the whole PC sector, and that’s pressuring the market today,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. Heading into a three-day weekend, investors were cautious about the chances for settling of major differences in Congress about government debt and spending. U.S. markets will be closed on Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday “Governmental policy, or lack thereof, is again pushing forth this wait-and-see attitude on the part of investors. So the market is flat and with low volume and low volatilty because investors are waiting to see what happens with the debt ceiling and spending cuts,” said Bryant Evans, investment adviser and portfolio manager at Cozad Asset Management, in Champaign, Illinois. There were signs that the question of raising the U.S. debt limit would be put off for a while. House Republican leaders said they would seek to pass a three-month extension of federal borrowing authority next week to buy time for the Democratic-controlled Senate to pass a budget that shrinks deficits.

Finisar shares fell 8 percent to $14.33 on Friday morning on the Nasdaq. Intel said silicon-photonics technology for data centers could soon be available commercially. Intel’s silicon products would be “bad news for manufacturers of traditional, manually-assembled optical transceivers for data centers, such as Finisar,” analyst James Kisner wrote in a note. Integrating silicon photonics will allow for much higher data transfers between processors and devices than is possible with electronics-based optical components, translating into lesser hardware requirement and lower building and operation costs. “While we suspect it will be a while before we see optical transceivers from Intel, our checks suggest a number of players, including Cisco, are likely to launch silicon photonics-based transceivers for 100G applications in the data center in 2013 and 2014,” Kisner wrote.

Shares of the world’s leading chipmaker slid more than 5 percent in after-hours trade on Thursday after it projected this year’s capital spending at $13 billion, plus or minus $500 million, exceeding many analysts’ estimates for about $10 billion. Intel said $2 billion of its increased expenditures would go toward expanding a facility for researching future manufacturing technology. Some analysts worried that with PC sales already slow, expanding too quickly may create excess capacity that could hurt the bottom line. “People are starting to freak out about the capex,” said Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. “The concern is that if I spend a lot of money and I build up my factories, I don’t have enough demand to fill them. They have very high fixed costs, and it pulls your margins down.” Outgoing Chief Executive Paul Otellini, who plans to retire in May after a successor is identified, said the investment in manufacturing would lower costs in the long run. “The leading edge capacity is the lowest cost for us on a per unit basis,” Otellini told analysts on a conference call. “Regardless of what you think the size of the market is, the leading edge fabs are the single greatest asset that we have.” Otellini said the higher capex is not intended to bankroll a foundry or contract chipmaking business, but he did not rule out manufacturing semiconductors for other chip companies as long as that did not empower a rival. Intel has agreed to manufacture custom chips on behalf of networking equipment company Cisco Systems Inc, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. An Intel spokesman declined to comment. In the fourth quarter, Intel’s revenue was $13.5 billion, compared with $13.9 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected $13.53 billion. It estimated first-quarter revenue of $12.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts expected $12.91 billion. Intel is used to being king of the personal computer market, particularly through its historic Wintel alliance with Microsoft Corp, which has led to breathtakingly high profit margins and an 80 percent market share. But it has struggled to adapt its technology for smartphones and tablets, a market dominated by Qualcomm Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Nvidia Corp. PC makers are struggling to stop a decline in sales as consumers hold off on buying new laptops in favor of more nimble mobile gadgets. Microsoft’s long-awaited launch of Windows 8 in October brought touchscreen features to laptops but failed to spark a resurgence in sales that Intel and many PC manufacturers had hoped for. Intel’s hefty investment plans reflect its confidence in the future, even as Wall Street worries about the chipmaker’s struggle to gain traction in the mobile market. “Our core advantage really is our manufacturing leadership,” Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told Reuters. “450 will give us a significant cost advantage relative to others.” Intel is expanding its research fab in Hillsboro, Oregon, to develop technology for manufacturing chips on 450 mm silicon wafers, a complicated step up from the current 300 mm wafer standard. Larger wafers can translate into big savings because more chips can be etched onto each of them. But building 450 mm plants is expected to be so expensive that only a few industry leaders, including Intel, Samsung Electronics and TSMC, are expected to have the necessary scale. Some Wall Street analysts gave Intel high marks for expected operating efficiency this year. “The revenue isn’t going to be there, but the margin and expense control is going to stabilize the bottom line,” said Cody Acree, an analyst at Williams Financial. “I think it’s probably a success if you can be flat in an industry that most people expect to be flat to down.” Intel foresees first-quarter gross margins of 58 percent, plus or minus two percentage points. Analysts on average expected gross margins of about 56 percent for the current quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It estimated a 2013 gross margin of 60 percent, plus or minus a few percentage points. Analysts on average had expected 59 percent. Net earnings in the December quarter were $2.5 billion, or 48 cents a share, compared with $3.4 billion, or 64 cents a share, year-ago period. Analysts had expected 45 cents, and said the surprisingly strong performance was partly due to a lower effective tax rate of 23 percent. This was below Intel’s forecast of about 27 percent. Still, shares of Intel fell 5.6 percent in after-hours trade to $21.43, after closing up 2.58 percent at $22.68 on the Nasdaq. “This is a company that is continuing to spend money to participate in the market. That may concern some investors,” said Doug Freedman, an analyst at RBC Capital.

441,INTC,RPT-Chipmaker Intel faces long march to mobile salvation,"By Jeremy Wagstaff and Clare Jim Jan 31 (Reuters) - Intel Corp, the world’s biggest chipmaker, opened a new front on Thursday in a long and stuttering campaign to get its processors into mobile phones, although it appears to still have a long way to go. It joined PC maker Acer Inc in Bangkok to unveil the Liquid C1 smartphone, a $330 device running Google Inc’s  Android operating system, which will be launched first in Thailand and then rolled out across Southeast Asia, one of the fastest-growing markets for mobile phones. “We’ve made a conscious effort to go after these fast-growing markets as our first foray into the business,” Mike Bell, who heads Intel’s mobile division said in a telephone interview. The company’s ninth such device in nine months, the Liquid C1 represents how far Intel has come in convincing bigger name manufacturers to take a chance with its mobile chips as the sales of personal computers and laptops plunge. But analysts say it also shows how far it still has to go to get a foothold in a  market dominated by the likes of Qualcomm Inc and Nvidia Corp. “First and foremost they have to prove they can play in this space at all,” said Scott Bicheno, senior analyst at Strategy Analytics. “There’s no obvious technical fault with Intel’s chips. It’s just that the incumbents are very well established.” Intel has little choice but to get into mobile. It saw revenue fall 3 percent in the last quarter on weak sales of PCs, part of a steady decline in revenue growth since 2009. It has also watched as devices like Apple Inc’s  iPad cannibalise sales of PCs. So, in the past year, the company has launched phones with Intel chips in Europe, Africa, Latin America, Russia, India and China. Some were effectively designed and built by Intel as what it calls “calling cards”, convincing carriers like Orange to brand and offer the phones on their own networks in France and the United Kingdom. Last year, it persuaded Chinese hardware manufacturers like ZTE Corp  and Lenovo Group Ltd to build their own phones with Intel chips. Sales have not been stellar. Intel declined to share data, as did ZTE and Lenovo. But Melissa Chau, senior research manager at technology research group IDC, said while Lenovo shipped more than 1 million units of its best-selling phone in China in the third quarter of last year, it shipped only about 20,000 of its first Intel phone, the K800. “That’s the scale we’re talking here,” she said. The problem for Intel is a historical one. By its own admission it has been slow to move in a fast-changing landscape where even a decade ago it was clear that desktop PCs and even laptops were giving way to smaller, lighter, connected devices for which lower power consumption was at least as important as processor power. In the past year or so, however, Intel seems to have shifted focus to mobile applications. It acquired Infineon Technologies’ wireless chip business in 2011 and hired and promoted phone experts like Bell. “These guys are phone specialists and they’ve really turned us around in terms of of the way we approach the market, the way we approach design,” said Uday Marty, managing director for Intel in Southeast Asia. It seems to be working, at least in terms of quality. UK-based Bicheno says the Motorola RAZR i phone that he has been using, which has an Intel chip, performs as well as any other Android phone. “They’ve learned a huge amount about the mobile world and how different it is, through their years of failures,” said Caroline Gabriel, head of research at consultancy Rethink Wireless. “Intel did not understand the process of getting devices onto carrier networks in the past, but it does now.” Intel has several aces up its sleeve. For one thing, it has longstanding relationships with the likes of Acer, Lenovo and Asustek Computer Inc, all of whom are in a similar predicament: as PC makers, they all need to grow their mobile business. But even then, they have been slow jumping aboard. Industry sources in Taiwan said that Intel had offered extensive lures to try its mobile chips. Intel executives acknowledged they had shouldered some costs but said it did not extend as far as  buying a production line of the PC makers. Intel, too, has used its experience in optimising its computers chips for Microsoft Windows software to work closely with Google on making Android run well on its devices. “We are not just investing in chips, we’re investing heavily in the software to run around them,” said Bell. But questions remain. First, some analysts point to Intel’s somewhat low-key entrance into the mobile sector, threatening to typecast the company as a low-end phone chip maker. This would doom it to playing a high-volume, low-margin game against low-cost chip makers in Taiwan like Mediatek. Intel counters that it is targeting the $200-$500 segment because that’s where a lot of the growth is, and that it intends to eventually offer chips that, like its PC chips, range across all price points. Intel executives also say they Will be offering a chip either later this year or early in 2014 that works on the 4G LTE networks already deployed in the United States and currently being rolled out in Europe. The problem there, says Gabriel of Rethink Wireless, is that it will then be lagging the likes of Qualcomm and STElectronics. Another concern is whether Intel can move beyond its usual partners. Persuading the likes of Acer and Lenovo to push out a smartphone is one thing, analysts say, but what about established phone makers like HTC Corp, let alone dominant players Samsung and Apple? Only then would Intel be able to get the volumes necessary for decent margins. In the long run, analysts said, a company with the resources of Intel had a reasonable chance of building at least some business in mobile. “Given Intel’s vast resources, I am not one to easily discount their ability to get into any market that they target,” said Francis Sideco, senior principal analyst at the IHS research firm. And as Intel’s Bell points out, the rapid fall of players like BlackBerry and Nokia, and the equally rapid rise of Samsung and Apple, suggest that just because Intel is a bit player now, it may not always be. “I was at a different firm building phones a couple of years ago and the company that was going to dominate Earth was RIM,” said Bell, who has worked at both Palm and Apple. He was referring to the Blackberry maker that has seen market share slip heavily in the past few years. “We’ll see two years from now who’s the market leader.”",1312013,http://www.reuters.com/article/intel/rpt-chipmaker-intel-faces-long-march-to-mobile-salvation-idUSL4N0B05H620130131

445,INTC,Informant in Galleon insider-trading case gets a year in prison,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Roomy Khan, a one-time technology company executive who became a key FBI informant in the insider-trading case against hedge-fund manager Raj Rajaratnam, was sentenced to 12 months in prison on Thursday. Her defense lawyer had sought five years of probation for Khan, 54, who pleaded guilty in 2009 to securities fraud, obstruction of justice and conspiracy. U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan also ordered her to forfeit nearly $1.53 million. “As I reflect back, I am horrified by the choices I made,” Khan said. Khan is one of only a few women who have been charged in the government’s broad insider-trading crackdown, which has involved money managers, traders, consultants and lawyers. Her cooperation helped U.S. authorities in the Rajaratnam prosecution. Rajaratnam, founder of the Galleon Group, was convicted by a federal jury in May 2011 and is serving an 11-year prison term. She was also called as a government witnesses at the insider trading trial of Doug Whitman, a California hedge fund manager and founder of Whitman Capital LLC who was sentenced last week to two years in prison. Prosecutors said Khan also obstructed the investigation, alerting co-conspirators that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had contacted her and deleting email communications. Khan, whose voice broke up during her sentencing, said she was sorry, not just to the court but also to her daughter, husband and parents. She said she lied to the government to protect herself, her friends and family and that she engaged in insider trading to “protect my life and status.” Since August 2009, federal prosecutors in New York have charged 76 people with insider trading and have landed convictions against 71 of them. By the end of Thursday, 42 of them will have been sentenced. Jason Pflaum, a former analyst at the hedge fund Barai Capital Management who cooperated in the Justice Department’s probe of expert-network firms, was sentenced later on Thursday to time served plus two years probation. Prosecutors said Khan met Rajaratnam shortly after landing a job as a marketing executive at Intel Corp in 1995. They contend that when Rajaratnam started Galleon, she began giving him non-public information about Intel. The FBI in San Francisco approached soon after. She was sentenced in 2002 to three years probation after pleading guilty to a count of wire fraud and reaching a cooperation agreement. Khan worked at Galleon but left to manage her and her husband’s personal portfolio. Prosecutors said in a sentencing memo filed on Friday that beginning in 2004, Khan again began soliciting non-public tips and trading on them. They said she also began exchanging her tips with other contacts and that she gave tips to Rajaratnam and Whitman. Prosecutors attributed Khan’s insider trading to personal financial difficulties. Her lawyer said in a court filing on Monday that she lost $49.6 million of her money when the Internet bubble burst. She began cooperating with the government in 2007 after the Federal Bureau of Investigation approached her. Her assistance led to a 2008 wiretap of Rajaratnam’s cell phone, which prosecutors said led to further evidence.

446,INTC,AppliedMicro sees future in low-power server chips,"SUNNYVALE, California (Reuters) - Chipmaker Applied Micro Circuits Corp believes selling low-power processors for cloud data centers run by the likes of Facebook, Google and Amazon.com Inc could account for half of its business within three years. AppliedMicro is one of a handful of chipmakers betting that energy-efficient microservers will become widely used in data centers and it appears to have an early advantage among rivals keen to challenge Intel. Chief Financial Officer Robert Gargus told Reuters in an interview on Thursday he has been increasingly impressed this month with performance test results on new chips that include 64-bit features widely used in servers, a first among its competitors relying on technology licensed from Britain’s ARM Holdings. ARM chips lack horsepower but data centers that combine many of them instead of just a few heavy-duty Intel processors may provide more computing power using less electricity. Gargus said AppliedMicro, whose stock has surged almost 80 percent since September, is on track to see revenue from microserver chips next year. Those chips could account for as much as half the company’s business within three years as leading-edge Internet companies like Facebook seek ways to reduce energy bills, followed by more traditional companies like big banks, Gargus said. “The question isn’t if but when. It comes down to, what’s the adoption curve?” he said. “We’re hoping that the (total cost of ownership) equation for this is compelling enough that people move fairly rapidly, but it’s hard to predict.” AppliedMicro already sells chips for wifi routers, cellphone base stations and other networking and storage devices. Analysts on average expect it to have $195 million revenue for the fiscal year ending in March, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. As the proliferation of smartphones and other connected devices drives demand for more data processed in remote “cloud” data centers, major Internet companies are seeking ways to cut energy bills, which Gargus said can easily account for half a data center’s operating costs. ARM Holdings’ energy-efficient chip technology has become ubiquitous in smartphones and tablets. Now the UK company and some of its partners are taking aim at the server market, long dominated by Intel. Microservers accounted just 0.2 percent of total server shipments in 2011, but they are expected to grow to more than 10 percent of the market by 2016, according to IHS iSuppli. AppliedMicro is working on two generations of chips: one built at 40 nanometers, which still needs to be tested by customers, and another more advanced processor at 28 nm. Anxious to maintain its domination of the server market, Intel in December launched its own low-power data center chip, saying they have been selected for over 20 upcoming products focused on microservers, storage and communications. PC chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices and Austin, Texas-based startup Calxeda are also developing microserver chips but neither are as far along as AppliedMicro on 64-bit technology typically used in data centers. Larger competitors Qualcomm and Samsung Electronics, which both use ARM’s technology to make chips for mobile gadgets, could also move into the microserver market and create a formidable challenge for AppliedMicro, analysts say.

447,INTC,Intel plans online TV service as PC chip sales wane,"DANA POINT, California (Reuters) - Top chipmaker Intel Corp plans to launch an Internet television service this year with live and on-demand content, entering a hotly competitive race as its core PC business erodes. Shifting into an unfamiliar and potentially costly market in which Intel lacks experience and relationships, Erik Huggers, vice president and general manager of Intel Media, said he is negotiating with content providers. He said hundreds of Intel employees and their families are already testing a set-top box the company will sell as part of the service. Intel’s move puts it into competition with heavyweights like Apple, Amazon and Google that believe the $100 billion cable television ecosystem is ripe for change. The chipmaker plans to offer consumers smaller bundles of content than those currently offered by cable operators, Erik Huggers, vice president and general manager of Intel Media, told the AllThingsDigital “Dive into Media” conference on Tuesday. Asked if Intel has inked any content deals, Huggers said he is working with providers and is confident Intel will have a compelling product to launch this year. “We have been working for (the past) year to set up Intel media, a new group focused on developing an Internet platform,” Huggers said. “It’s not a value play, it’s a quality play where we’ll create a superior experience for the end user.” Intel has struggled to get its virtual television service off the ground due to unwillingness on the part of major media content providers to let the company unbundle and license specific networks and shows at a discount to what cable and satellite partners pay, according to sources. Silicon Valley has been taking aim at the U.S. cable television market - dominated by major distributors such as Comcast and DirecTV Group and program makers like Walt Disney Co and Time Warner Inc. Technology companies see opportunities due to reasons ranging from shifting viewer habits to mounting programming costs. Intel’s plan, if successful, would go further than products currently offered by Apple, Amazon and Netflix by offering live programming as well as on-demand content. “There is an opportunity to offer a bundle that can be curated by the consumer, an opportunity to create smarter bundles,” Huggers said. Intel’s set-top-box will also have a camera that could be used to automatically steer content and ads toward specific users. “There’s a scenario where the TV recognizes that it’s you and says ‘Hey, I know what you like. I know what you want to watch’, versus the environment we’re in today where the TV literally is not interested in you at all,” Huggers told Reuters In an interview. Some media executives are skeptical that Intel will be able to convince content providers to agree to terms that are attractive enough to make its service viable. That view was shared by Bernard Gershon, head of digital consultancy GershonMedia and a former Disney senior vice president for strategic planning who helped develop Disney’s online strategy. “The chance that Intel launches is zero,” Gershon, who speaks with media and digital executives, told Reuters at the conference. “They haven’t cut any deals with any content companies, and they are not offering something that differentiates itself enough on service or price to get the deals done.” Analysts see Intel’s leap into Internet television, along with its growing focus on smartphones and tablets, as a way to diversify beyond the slowing PC market. “The question you have to ask with Intel is, Is anything they do big enough to move the needle?” said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein. “You’re not going to make or break the company on something like this.” Huggers said in the interview that Intel employees are testing the device’s user interface, sound and picture quality and other features. “We’re actively testing it in the field with employees. It’s not the final product, but it’s certainly functional,” he said. Industry insiders have said Apple may unveil a TV-based device that has the potential to shake up the cozy television content and distribution industry the way the iPod and iPhone disrupted music and mobile content.

451,INTC,Intel takes big step in chip foundry business,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp has agreed to make chips on behalf of Altera, a significant step toward opening its prized manufacturing technology to customers on a larger scale, potentially including Apple. Sharing its manufacturing plants, or fabs, to strategic customers could help the world’s top chipmaker offset the growing costs of developing new technology and help keep the plants running near capacity as Intel’s traditional PC business loses steam. Intel will make Altera’s programmable chips using its upcoming 14 nanometer trigate transistor technology, the most notable agreement of its kind announced so far by the chipmaker. “It’s a step in terms of building into a business level we wish to achieve,” Sunit Rikhi, Vice President and General Manager of Intel custom foundry, told Reuters on Monday. “There’s no doubt in my mind the foundry will be a significant player in the future.” Building new generations of chip manufacturing plants is becoming more and more expensive, and Intel has said in the past it was willing to open its facilities to carefully selected customers - as long as doing so does not its help competitors. Intel has announced agreements to manufacture on behalf of Achronix Semiconductor Corp and other small chipmakers but Monday’s announcement with Altera, one of two leading programmable chipmakers, is potentially much larger. “They’ve crossed over the line from it just being a questionable experiment to - we’re going to do this for tier-1 customers,” said RBC analyst Doug Freedman. With Intel struggling to find its footing in smarpthones and tablets with its own processor designs, some investors believe Intel may eventually agree to make Apple’s processors for the iPhone and iPad. “If and when we are called upon to serve large mobile customers who can drive a lot more volume, we could serve them today in terms of capability,” Rikhi said. “I’m confident we have a very strong platform of offering upon which we can scale.” He declined to discuss Apple specifically. Most chipmakers in recent decades have given up running their own capital-intensive fabs, turning instead to contract manufacturing “foundries” like Taiwan’s TSMC. Intel has kept its own fabs and invested heavily in them over decades, resulting in a lead in manufacturing know-how that allows it to make chips that in some respects are more advanced than products from rivals like Qualcomm and Samsung Electronics. Altera Chief Executive John Daane told Reuters in a phone interview that Altera, which depends on communications infrastructure for about half of its business, is the only major programmable chipmaker that will have access to Intel’s plants. “We are essentially getting access like an extra division of Intel. As soon as they’re making the technology available to their various groups to do design work, we’re getting the same,” he said. Daane said Intel’s manufacturing technology will give Altera’s chips a several-year advantage against Xilinx, its main competitor in programmable chips. He said Altera would continue to make other chips with TSMC, its long-time foundry. Shares of Altera were unchanged in extended trading after closing down 0.96 percent at $35.01.

456,INTC,"Analysis: Next Intel CEO to guide new business, maybe Apple deal","SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Intel’s next CEO is likely to shepherd the top chipmaker into a growing contract-manufacturing business, a strategic shift that could lead to a deal with Apple Inc and give it a fighting chance to make inroads in the mobile arena. Manufacturing chips on behalf of other companies is a major departure for Intel, which for decades has based its business on using its manufacturing prowess to offer its own PC chips superior to rival products. As PC sales contract and Intel’s fabrication plants operate at less than full capacity, the chipmaker sees an opportunity to fill idle production lines while earning new revenue. Such a move may also offer a backdoor of sorts into large-scale production of chips for mobile devices, where Intel has made little headway after underestimating the impact of the iPhone and iPad and falling behind more nimble rivals. Intel said last week it will open up its prized manufacturing technology to make chips designed by fellow chipmaker Altera — snagging its first sizeable customer in a contract manufacturing, or “foundry”, business expected to grow. That has spurred talk of an Apple deal. A source close to one of the companies says Intel and Apple executives have discussed the issue in the past year but no agreement has been reached. “If you can have a strategic relationship where you’re making chips for one of the largest mobile players, you should definitely consider that. And for Apple, that gets them a big advantage.” said Pat Becker Jr, of Becker Capital Management, which owned about $39 million worth of Intel shares at the end of last year. Intel’s plan entails heavy capital spending, even as it struggles in its core market and has yet to find enough new demand to fill future fabrication plants. It would also mean getting into a foundry sector that, because it depends on volume to drive business, is highly vulnerable to economic swings and could compress Intel’s industry-leading margins. But it is a bet that analysts say is necessary if Intel wants to remain a top player. The company believes that taking on more contract manufacturing business will not only help fill an upcoming generation of production lines, but help pay for the cost of research to upgrade them. After Intel upped its capital spending budget by $2 billion to $13 billion this year, speculation grew that Apple could ink a deal to use Intel’s leading process technology to make better chips for its iPad and iPhone. Doing so could help Apple end its foundry relationship with Samsung, which has become a fierce competitor with its own smartphones and tablets. Sunit Rikhi, vice president and general manager of Intel custom foundry, told Reuters last week his group is ready to take on a potential large, unidentified mobile customer, although he declined to discuss Apple specifically. Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said the chipmaker is in constant discussions with Apple, which buys its PC chips, but he would not comment on negotiations about a potential foundry relationship. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. This is all happening as the board of directors at Intel looks for a candidate to replace outgoing CEO Paul Otellini, a talent search that has gone on longer than some insiders expected since it was announced in November. While Otellini has said he expects to be replaced by an Intel insider, the board of directors has recently increased its focus on potential outside candidates, according to two sources. Whomever the board chooses must face fundamental decisions about Intel’s still-small contract manufacturing business, like how much and how quickly to expand and whether it should supply to Apple, which designs its mobile chips using technology Intel competes with. “This is potentially huge,” said JMP analyst Alex Gauna. “The new CEO will have a very large opportunity to take this to the next level. Those discussions about taking on Apple as a foundry customer are going to be very complex and very contentious.” Intel’s chip-manufacturing technology is at least two years ahead of Taiwanese foundry TSMC’s or Samsung’s. But critics say Intel’s “x86” chip architecture is better suited to PCs and servers than to mobile gadgets, which prize low power-consumption and portability. Demand for chips used in smartphones and tablets is far outpacing demand for PC chips, making mobile a must-have market for Intel and other semiconductor manufacturers. Making Apple’s chips however would come at a price for Intel. Such a move could be seen as a capitulation of Intel’s own smartphone and tablet chip designs, which are gradually becoming more efficient but have yet to be accepted for use in any major devices. Complicating a possible deal is that the iPhone maker designs its mobile chips with technology licensed from ARM Holdings. ARM’s architecture competes against Intel’s and is ubiquitous in mobile gadgets, where Intel’s own technology has not caught on. Santa Clara, California-based Intel has long been king of the PC chip market, particularly through its historic “Wintel” alliance with Microsoft, which led to breathtakingly high profit margins and an 80 percent market share. Intel’s gross margins are expected to be about 60 percent this year, down from 62 percent in 2012 but still more attractive than TSMC’s gross margins of around 48 percent. “They have a business-model question they have to answer. That’s something the new CEO will have to wrestle with,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. Intel has struggled to adapt its powerful processors for battery-powered smartphones and tablets that require much less intensive computing. Its market share for smartphones stands at less than 1 percent, trailing Qualcomm, Samsung and others. Concerns on Wall Street about slowing PC sales and Intel’s lack of progress in mobile have pushed the chipmaker’s shares down about 19 percent over the past year. In Intel’s favor is the fact that the sheer amount of investment involved in new generations of semiconductor manufacturing technology has led most chipmakers in recent decades to give up running their own capital-intensive fabrication plants, turning instead to foundries like TSMC. Intel’s agreement with Altera followed deals with minor chipmakers to use Intel’s fabs. Otellini in December said “a lot of stuff” was in the pipeline. Shifting production of iPhone and iPad chips to Intel could lead to an additional $4.2 billion in revenue in 2015, with a gross margin of around 50 percent, according to Macquarie analyst Shawn Webster. “They’ve got to have a foundry component to the business, just so they can get the best return on investment for all that capital they’re spending,” said Evercore Partners analyst Patrick Wang. “The next CEO is the guy or gal who’s going to execute that strategy.” ",3072013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-intel-foundry/analysis-next-intel-ceo-to-guide-new-business-maybe-apple-deal-idUSBRE92609R20130307
457,INTC,Global PC shipments falling more than expected: IDC,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Global PC shipments, already hit by consumers’ growing preferences for tablets and smartphones, are falling more than previously predicted due to weakness in China, according to market research firm IDC. Slower February shipments in China caused by government budget cuts and other factors mean worldwide PC shipments could fall by a “double-digit” percentage in the first quarter, compared with a previous estimated decline of 7.7 percent, IDC said in a report on Monday. For all of 2013, global PC shipments will probably fall between 1.8 percent and 2 percent, IDC analyst Loren Loverde told Reuters. “Even getting to positive growth in the second half of 2013 will take some attractive new PC designs and more competitive pricing relative to tablets and other products,” he said. A handful of financial analysts have recently trimmed their forecasts for top PC chipmaker Intel Corp’s first-quarter results because of concerns over weak PC sales. In China, which accounts for more than a fifth of global PC shipments, government spending cuts and anti-corruption measures have added to the timing of Chinese New Year in reducing purchases of new PCs in February, according to IDC. Earlier this month, IDC said 2013 global PC shipments would probably fall 1.3 percent, extending a 3.7 percent decline in 2012. Intel, whose processors are used in 80 percent of PCs, has said it expects revenue between $12.2 billion and $13.2 billion in the March quarter, which it is due to report on April 16. Analysts on average expect Intel’s first-quarter revenue to be $12.69 billion, down about 6 percent from the December quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

460,INTC,Intel's media unit on hiring spree to prep for TV debut,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp’s media group has been on a hiring spree as it prepares to launch an Internet television service later this year, underscoring the chip maker’s seriousness about the new business. Intel Media is now looking to add 60 people to its staff of over 300, said spokesman Jon Carvill. He said the group could number 400 within the next six months or so, compared to less than 100 a year ago. In a major divergence from its core business of manufacturing chips for PCs, Intel plans to sell consumers a television set-top box that offers live programming as well as on-demand content in small bundles. It will compete with heavyweights like Apple Inc, Amazon Inc and Google Inc that believe the $100 billion cable television ecosystem is ripe for change. The service, announced in February, would go further than products currently offered by Apple, Netflix and others. But some media executives and analysts have been skeptical that Intel will be able to convince content providers to agree to terms that are attractive enough to make the service viable. Carvill declined to comment on the progress of content negotiations other than to say Intel is engaged with partners and remains confident it will launch later this year. Intel Media, led by former BBC executive Erik Huggers, is looking for engineers experienced in cloud computing, user interface design and security. Intel also wants specialists in Hadoop, a platform used for mining vast troves of digital data. That could point toward a heavy emphasis on analyzing customers’ viewing habits. Huggers has said the product’s set-top box will include a camera that could be used to automatically steer content and ads toward specific users. One job ad on Intel’s website is for an “audience representative” who would be responsible for communicating with customers via phone, chat, email, and possibly video.

462,INTC,Intel's new approach to retirement: encore careers,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Intel Corp. has something new inside: A $25,000 retiree benefit to help older workers transition into new careers in non-profit organizations. Last year, the technology giant launched the Intel Encore Career Fellowship - a program offering a paid, one-year, $25,000 stipend to encourage near-retirement employees to put their skills to work in new careers with a social purpose. The fellowships are part of a broader movement to encourage encore careers spearheaded by Encore.org, a non-profit led by Marc Freedman, a leading thinker and author on the topic. Much is at stake. While Washington worries about the growing burden of entitlement spending to support an aging population, programs like Encore are focused on leveraging the experience of millions of retirees for the greater good. Continued participation in the labor force is a net positive for the economy and the federal budget - and it can boost retirement security down the road for seniors by allowing them to delay filing for Social Security, and by adding to retirement saving accounts. At the same time, Encore appeals to the instinct for a second act that is so prevalent in the baby boomer generation. Intel isn’t the only company to experiment with this type of retirement transition program. There have been encore fellows in 15 states and the District of Columbia, and dozens of companies and foundations have participated in the program. Hewlett-Packard Co is a founding sponsor of the program and Goldman Sachs Group Inc has also participated. But Intel’s program stands out because the company is offering the benefit to any employee over the age of 50, at any level, as part of its retirement benefits, depending on the length of their service. Employees must submit applications for evaluation, and then Intel attempts to match them up with non-profits, which post openings for fellows. The fellows program is still in its pilot phase, but it has the potential to ramp up into a major program at Intel - and it’s off to a strong start. Forty employees are working as fellows, and another 80 are in the pipeline, says Julie Wirt, Intel’s global retirement design manager. “We wanted something that would work for all of our U.S. employees, no matter what previous work history,” she says. “And we thought this would bring tremendous value to nonprofits. The numbers are higher than we anticipated, and it’s one of the benefits our people are aware of more than any others.” Indeed, participation is coming from all parts of the company. A construction project manager is doing similar work for a Portland, Oregon non-profit, while an engineer from Massachusetts is working as a site manager in Florida for Habitat for Humanity. Sonia Hodshire was an Intel manufacturing supervisor in Albuquerque, New Mexico. She retired last year at age 67 after 26 years with the company and won an encore fellowship working with the Roadrunner Food Bank of New Mexico. The 30-year-old non-profit distributes more than 26 million pounds of food annually to a network of hundreds of partner agencies and four regional food banks. Hodshire put her expertise in sophisticated, robotics-based microprocessor manufacturing to work helping Roadrunner reorganize its warehouse operations to improve its process flow. “I’d been feeling anxiety about separating from the company,” she says. “I had a feeling like, ‘I’m no good anymore - I’m going to be put out to pasture. I knew I didn’t want to sit at home on a rocking chair, that just isn’t my style.” The shift into non-profit work has been a culture shock - but in a wonderful way, Hodshire says. “As a manufacturing supervisor, you’re accustomed to giving orders - making sure goals are met, no deviation. You investigate and analyze outputs,” says Hodshire. “I often felt like an extension of my machinery.” “At the food bank, everything is different,” she says. “The equipment is archaic, and the budgeting is hand-to-mouth. But people have a pride in their work and their mission that I haven’t seen in many people. And the job satisfaction is enormous. I know when I make the operation more efficient, the faster we can deliver food to needy people in New Mexico. And that is a human reward that is priceless.” Hodshire’s fellowship at the food bank draws to a close at the end of April, but she plans to continue working in non-profits, probably with a combination of volunteer and paid work. She retired with a lump sum pension payout and Social Security. “I’m okay financially, but don’t want to work for no pay at all,” she says. “Maybe I haven’t grown enough to say I’ll do it just for love. But I don’t need to make as much, maybe enough to pay for gas and a couple of little things.” “I’ve discovered a passion within me and I want to feel that I’ve used the end of my life to accomplish something that will help people,” she adds. And that’s a good feeling - inside. (The writer is a Reuters columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

466,INTC,Intel's foresees second-quarter sales decline as PC market shrinks,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp said its current-quarter revenue would decline as much as 8 percent and trimmed its 2013 capital spending plans, as personal computer sales drop due to the growing popularity of tablets and smartphones. Shares in the world’s largest chip maker rallied as much as 3 percent after hours but quickly gave up the gains. The stock had been battered over the past week after researcher IDC revealed that PC sales notched a record quarterly decline in the first quarter. Despite persistently weak demand for PCs, Intel held firm on its previous forecast that 2013 revenue would grow by a low single-digit percentage, a target some analysts believe is becoming more difficult to hit. Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told analysts on a conference call after Intel’s earnings report on Tuesday that its upcoming Haswell chip, as well as new ultrathin laptops and an improving economy, would revive growth in the second half of the year. “That scares the hell out of me. They are holding to the same ultra-bullish forecast they gave before,” said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Bernstein Research. “They are presumably pretty bullish on the new products they are planning.” Personal computer sales plunged 14 percent in the first three months of the year, the biggest decline in the two decades on record, as tablets grew more popular and buyers seemed to be avoiding Microsoft Corp’s new Windows 8 operating system, according to IDC. Under pressure, Intel also said in its quarterly news release on Tuesday that it was reducing 2013 capital spending from $13 billion to $12 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Intel said its first-quarter revenue fell to $12.58 billion from $12.91 billion in the year-ago quarter. The world’s largest chipmaker forecast June-quarter revenue of $12.9 billion, plus or minus $500 million.

The stock had been battered over the past week after researcher IDC revealed that PC sales notched a record quarterly decline in the first quarter. Despite persistently weak demand for PCs, Intel held firm on its previous forecast that 2013 revenue would grow by a low single-digit percentage, a target some analysts believe is becoming more difficult to hit. Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told analysts on a conference call after Intel’s earnings report on Tuesday that its upcoming Haswell chip, as well as new ultrathin laptops and an improving economy, would revive growth in the second half of the year. “That scares the hell out of me. They are holding to the same ultra-bullish forecast they gave before,” said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Bernstein Research. “They are presumably pretty bullish on the new products they are planning.” Personal computer sales plunged 14 percent in the first three months of the year, the biggest decline in the two decades on record, as tablets grew more popular and buyers seemed to be avoiding Microsoft Corp’s new Windows 8 operating system, according to IDC. Under pressure, Intel also said in its quarterly news release on Tuesday that it was reducing 2013 capital spending from $13 billion to $12 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Intel said its first-quarter revenue fell to $12.58 billion from $12.91 billion in the year-ago quarter. The world’s largest chipmaker forecast June-quarter revenue of $12.9 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Compared to the second quarter of last year, that amounts to roughly no change or a drop of as much as 8 percent. Analysts had expected $12.588 billion in revenue for the first quarter and $12.854 billion for the June quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Intel posted first-quarter net income of $2.04 billion, or 40 cents a share, down from $2.74 billion, or 55 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Analysts on average had expected 41 cents per share. “These numbers are not very solid, but the second-quarter guidance is better than feared. Conditions are probably not as bad as industry reports have suggested recently,” said Doug Freedman, an analyst at RBC Capital. Shares of Intel edged down less than 1 percent in extended trade after closing up 2.5 percent at $21.91 on Nasdaq.

473,INTC,Tech industry cautiously welcomes Senate immigration bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tech industry officials welcomed a bipartisan U.S. Senate immigration bill on Tuesday, saying they hoped it would make it easier to hire highly skilled workers from abroad, while laying the groundwork to renegotiate portions they oppose. The bipartisan “Gang of Eight” group of senators released highlights of the bill, backed by President Barack Obama, that seeks to reform the immigration system and nearly doubles the quota for H-1B visas for skilled workers. For months, the tech sector has ratcheted up pressure on the U.S. Congress to make highly skilled immigration rules more flexible, arguing that there are not enough highly skilled American workers to fill its growing number of specialty job openings. “This really does a lot to address our concerns about being able to hire workers when we need them,” Intel Corp (INTC.O) policy director Peter Muller said in an interview on Tuesday. “We’re certainly going to be looking into details of this going forward ... but in terms of the big picture, we’re very encouraged and pleased.” The bill did not propose raising the number of H-1B visas as high as 300,000, as big tech companies had sought in the past, but it would allow the cap to rise to as high as 180,000 in future years, and sets aside 25,000 such visas for graduates with degrees in science, technology, engineering and math. Companies will likely appreciate some provisions of the bill, including loosening of green card or permanent residency provisions, said Stuart Anderson, executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy, a think tank backed by the pro-entrepreneurship Kauffman Foundation and others. “But the H-1B provisions will be considered a disaster,” he said, citing measures including expanded Department of Labor authority to investigate companies over their decisions to hire H-1B workers. “Trying to defend yourself for something that has a large degree of subjectivity could be a problem for some companies,” Anderson said. Most companies and tech groups, including the new group FWD.us formed by Facebook Inc’s (FB.O) Mark Zuckerberg to lobby on the issue, withheld comment awaiting a review of the full text of the bill. “We’re very encouraged that they produced a bill and we see a lot of positives, but we do have some concerns we hope to see worked out,” said Dan Turrentine, vice president for government relations at TechNet, a group representing such companies as Google Inc (GOOG.O), Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Yahoo! Inc YHOO.O. Tech companies will be watching several provisions in the bill that risk becoming hindrances to prompt hiring, including new requirements to pay H-1B visa holders higher wages and to recruit American workers prior to hiring foreigners. Both provisions seek to address the concerns of workers’ groups that oppose raising the number of H-1B visas, saying companies use the visas as a way to hire cheaper workers who lack job mobility. “We appreciate that the Senate Gang recognizes that serious problems with the H-1B program can be resolved by more STEM green cards, delivered faster,” said Marc Apter, president of IEEE-USA, which represents U.S. engineering, computing and technology workers, in a statement. “In fact, the proposed increases in green cards make H-1B increases unnecessary,” Apter said. The bill also includes provisions that would hurt so-called “H-1B-dependent” companies, like many IT outsourcing firms that employ high numbers of H-1B visa holders - programmers they temporarily hire out to corporate customers. Those outsourcing firms could have to pay higher fees and wages than companies that depend less on H-1B workers, like Apple, Google and Facebook. A spokesman for Tata Consulting Services, an outsourcing company, said he could not comment before seeing the full bill. “We think it’s very reasonable to add additional requirements to the users of the H-1B visa, but those also have to be workable requirements, so that’s something we’re going to pay close attention to,” said Intel’s Muller. “But we know it’s going to be a long process ... and as a starting point, we’re really encouraged.” ",4172013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-tech/tech-industry-cautiously-welcomes-senate-immigration-bill-idUSBRE93F1DL20130417

475,INTC,AMD results beat expectations in declining PC market,"(Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices Inc forecast current-quarter revenue above Wall Street’s expectations as it rushes to find new markets to offset its declining core business of PC chips. Like larger rival Intel Corp, AMD is trying to refocus its business as sales of laptops languish and consumers increasingly depend on smartphones and tablets. It shares fell nearly 6 percent after the report, erasing sudden gains in the last few minutes of the trading session. AMD on Thursday reported revenue of $1.09 billion, down from $1.59 billion in the year-ago quarter. It said June-quarter revenue would rise 2 percent, plus or minus 3 percent, compared with the March quarter. Analysts on average expected first-quarter revenue of $1.046 billion and June-quarter revenue of $1.071 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “In a world of low expectations this is a decent report - a solid beat off of low expectations,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. When Intel posted its quarterly earnings on Tuesday, it also gave a revenue forecast above expectations, betting on a recovery in PC sales in the second half of the year. While Intel has deep pockets to fund research on new processors to catch up in tablets and smartphones, AMD faces declining cash flows and a more modest balance sheet. It is reducing operating expenses and refocusing its chip technology on new markets like communications, microservers, game consoles, digital signs and stripped-down “thin client” computers. AMD said in a statement it had a net loss of $146 million, or 19 cents a share, in the first quarter, compared with a loss of $590 million, or 80 cents a share, in the same quarter last year. Its adjusted loss per share was 13 cents. Analysts expected 18 cents.

479,INTC,"Intel picks insider as CEO, dashing hopes for shakeup","SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Intel Corp chose veteran insider Brian Krzanich as chief executive, disappointing some investors who hoped an outsider would push for aggressive changes to help the world’s largest chipmaker catch up in the mobile revolution. The company also announced on Thursday that software honcho Renée James, 48, had been elevated to the post of president. Her appointment signaled to some that Intel, while likely intending to stick with its formula of intense investment to keep it ahead in the microchip technology game, is willing to explore new growth areas. The company said last November that it might go external for its next CEO, raising hopes that it might find someone to shake it out of recent doldrums. Seen as a frontrunner for the job since November, Krzanich inherits a company with margins of almost 60 percent that has all but extinguished rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc in the past few years, and is now the dominant maker of microprocessors for computers and servers. But the company is in danger of finding itself sidelined as mobile devices such as tablets and ever more powerful smartphones accelerate a contraction of the personal computer market. The majority of gadgets today run processors based on rival ARM Holdings Plc’s power-saving chip architecture. “An external candidate might have been a better choice - with no negative reflection on Brian - simply because of the juncture Intel is at with what’s happening in the PC market and the need to take major action outside of PCs,” said Cody Acree, an analyst at Williams Financial Group. “Brian may very well come in and make those same very difficult dramatic choices, but it’s less likely.” He will take on the top job at the company’s annual shareholder meeting on May 16, replacing Paul Otellini. A relative unknown outside the tight-knit semiconductor industry, Krzanich has worked at Intel since 1982, rising to chief operating officer just over a year ago. The 52-year-old has earned a reputation for being a decisive leader who liked to keep a low profile. Intel on Thursday stressed that he will have a strong partner in James, who in 2011 spearheaded Intel’s $7.7 billion acquisition of No. 2 security software firm McAfee Inc. She ran software product and service sales as well as a team of engineers focused on improving the performance of Microsoft Corp’s Windows 8 and Google Inc’s Android software when run on the company’s microchips. Her elevation “puts emphasis on the many businesses Intel is in beyond just chips. This is an important promotion, and it clearly signals the board wants to make Intel a much broader company,” said Jack Gold, who runs research outfit Jack Gold Associates. Intel shares closed 0.5 percent higher at $24.11 on the Nasdaq on Thursday. Intel’s board took six months to deliberate on who could best helm a company with deep roots in Silicon Valley and computing history. The company today rakes in more than $50 billion in annual sales and runs manufacturing facilities across the globe. Over the past few months, media reports have mentioned several possible external candidates including Sanjay Jha, former head of Motorola’s mobile device division. Intel Chairman Andy Bryant said Krzanich is capable of effecting a transformational move. But he also said Krzanich and James made for an “extremely powerful” partnership, and that the pair had co-developed a long-term strategic vision for the company that won the board over. “They formed a partnership through the last few months that has blossomed into an extremely powerful pair,” he said. “You’ll see a fairly dramatic change over a period of time,” Bryant told Reuters in an interview. “If you look at Intel’s past, with every CEO we’ve had that.” Krzanich’s appointment comes at a crucial time for the company, which is gearing up for a transition in manufacturing processes to larger, 450 millimeter wafers, a gradual migration that may eventually trim production costs but which requires spending billions of dollars to upgrade facilities. And it is scrambling to finalize and launch next-generation processors - code-named “Haswell” - that it hopes will cut down on power consumption and close the gap with ARM-based rival chips, popular among mobile users who prioritize battery life. A chemical engineer by training who went to school in Northern California, Krzanich started with Intel in New Mexico as a process engineer before moving on to a series of factory management positions. He holds a patent for semiconductor processing and sits on the board of an industry association. He told Reuters in a 2012 interview his best work during his three-decade career included shortening turnaround times in the chipmaker’s factories. Intel announced in November that it was looking for a new CEO as Otellini announced plans to retire. The Santa Clara, California, company came under fire during Otellini’s tenure for missing out on the mobile revolution, while underestimating the scale of the eventual drop-off in personal computer demand. The company, which once said emerging markets could offset a dropoff in developed-world demand, orchestrated a push on pricey “Ultrabook” laptops that has so far failed to excite consumers. Last month, Intel warned that current-quarter revenue would fall as much as 8 percent, given the drop in PC sales. The company affirmed its full-year revenue growth target, but analysts think that forecast will be hard to hit. “Some investors preferred an external option on the belief that new blood was needed,” said Raymond James analyst Hans Mosesmann. But “the appointment is an indication that Intel will continue Paul Otellini’s strategy of building bigger, better fabs to attack the market.” ",5022013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-intel-ceo/intel-picks-insider-as-ceo-dashing-hopes-for-shakeup-idUSBRE9410O720130502

Following are analyst reactions to the news: “It’s probably the smoothest transition they could ask for. Brian is very well rounded and very in tune with where Intel is today. “An external candidate might have been a better choice - with no negative reflection on Brian - simply because of the juncture Intel is at with what’s happening in the PC market and the need to take major action outside of PCs. “Maybe an external candidate with a fresh set of eyes without being beholden to any legacy business division, personnel, or strategy might have been better.” “Some people will be disappointed because they were looking for a change in direction.” “I believe he was the consensus pick. So perception or the initial reaction will be steady as she goes. “He was the obvious choice from the standpoint that they selected the COO as their CEO several times in the past. This removes the risk of uncertainty of an outsider coming in and changing the strategy at the company. I think the street will perceive it as Intel’s strategy remaining consistent.” ",5022013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-intel-ceo-instant/analyst-view-intel-names-coo-krzanich-as-new-ceo-idUSBRE9410R620130502
482,INTC,Lehman Brothers sues Intel over $1 billion in seized collateral,"(Reuters) - Bankrupt investment bank Lehman Brothers has sued Intel Corp, accusing the chip maker of seizing $1 billion in collateral in breach of a swap agreement, a court filing showed. Under the swap agreement, executed days before Lehman filed for bankruptcy in 2008, Intel gave $1 billion to a derivatives unit of Lehman Brothers in exchange for 50.5 million Intel shares, to be delivered on the settlement date of September 29, 2008, according to the filing made in a New York bankruptcy court. The unit, Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives Inc (LOTC), posted $1 billion in cash collateral to Intel also as part of the agreement. The agreement specified that Intel would be compensated for losses in case of early termination of the deal. According to the filing, Intel maintained that Lehman was to deliver “$1 billion in Intel common stock,” but Lehman argued that the agreement was to deliver 50.5 million of Intel shares irrespective of the dollar value. “The value of 50,552,943 shares of Intel common stock on September 29, 2008 was about $873 million, not $1 billion,” Lehman said. Intel terminated the agreement two weeks after the company’s bankruptcy filing on September 15, 2008, and seized the entire $1 billion in collateral and has not returned it, Lehman said in the filing. By seizing the collateral in its entirety, Lehman said “Intel breached the swap agreement.” Lehman is looking to recover from Intel an unspecified amount to be determined at trial. Intel could not immediately be reached for comment by Reuters outside of regular U.S. business hours. Lehman filed the largest-ever U.S. bankruptcy on September 15, 2008, with $639 billion in assets. It is in the midst of repaying about $65 billion to creditors under a liquidation plan approved in late 2011.

Under the swap agreement, executed days before Lehman filed for bankruptcy in 2008, Intel gave $1 billion to a derivatives unit of Lehman Brothers in exchange for 50.5 million Intel shares, to be delivered on the settlement date of Sept. 29, 2008, according to the filing made in a New York bankruptcy court. The unit, Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives Inc (LOTC), posted $1 billion in cash collateral to Intel also as part of the agreement. The agreement specified that Intel would be compensated for losses in case of early termination of the deal. According to the filing, Intel maintained that Lehman was to deliver “$1 billion in Intel common stock,” but Lehman argued that the agreement was to deliver 50.5 million of Intel shares irrespective of the dollar value. “The value of 50,552,943 shares of Intel common stock on Sept. 29, 2008 was about $873 million, not $1 billion,” Lehman said. Intel terminated the agreement two weeks after the company’s bankruptcy filing on Sept. 15, 2008, and seized the entire $1 billion in collateral and has not returned it, Lehman said in the filing. By seizing the collateral in its entirety, Lehman said “Intel breached the swap agreement.” Lehman is looking to recover from Intel an unspecified amount to be determined at trial. Intel could not immediately be reached for comment by Reuters outside of regular U.S. business hours. Lehman filed the largest-ever U.S. bankruptcy on Sept. 15, 2008, with $639 billion in assets. It is in the midst of repaying about $65 billion to creditors under a liquidation plan approved in late 2011.

484,INTC,"Run silent, run deep: The life of Brian Krzanich at Intel","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - It took him 30 years, but Brian Krzanich - the understated, analytical engineer who started his career at an Intel chip factory in New Mexico - quietly worked his way up to the top. Now, the man who once prided himself on halving production times will have to act swiftly to move the company into new areas of growth. Krzanich will take over as chief executive beginning on May 16 at the annual shareholder meeting, replacing Paul Otellini, who in November unexpectedly announced his plan to retire. Under Otellini, Intel has been sidelined in smartphones and tablets while demand for its PC processors is on the wane. To turn around the $53 billion-a-year empire, Krzanich will have to depend on trusted lieutenants, something he shouldn’t have a problem doing, say former employees, analysts and industry executives who have worked with him. In 2010, Krzanich was on the brink of a weighty decision: whether to break with tradition and open up Intel’s top-secret manufacturing facilities and make chips for other companies. He called a teleconference of 8-10 key people - executives from marketing, investor relations and sales among them - and began firing off questions. He wanted to know if going ahead with the manufacturing deal could create any potential problems for other areas within Intel, like upsetting major customers or creating misunderstandings on Wall Street about Intel’s core strategies. “His job was to say, Can we do it economically and make money in our factory? But he was really good about making sure the supply-chain guys, the marketing guys, everyone kind of understood the impact of (the potential deal),” one of the people on the conference call told Reuters. In less than an hour, he took a decision that would pave the way toward a new business for Intel: Achronix became its first foundry customer. This past February, Altera Corp became its first major client for the business, and industry insiders believe it could eventually reach a similar deal with Apple. At a company known in Silicon Valley for its insular culture, Krzanich went largely unnoticed by investors and media even as he rose through the ranks to senior positions. Two former longtime employees said that when they left Intel less than a decade ago, they had never even heard of Krzanich, though he was then in charge of the company’s assembly and test facilities. The new CEO is a mystery even to some of the best-connected of the chip industry elite. Paul Jacobs, CEO of No. 2 U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc, said on Thursday he looked forward to meeting Krzanich. The San Jose State University graduate, who declined to comment for this story, has an engaged but quiet management style, although an employee said engineers who miss their deadlines or targets tend not to stay in positions of responsibility. When Krzanich was promoted to chief operating officer last year, Intel pushed him into the public spotlight, exposing him a little more to the media. Given a choice between speaking to an investor or a reporter, Krzanich will choose the investor every time, another Intel employee who knows him well said. As recently as a few years ago he was known to drive just an ordinary car, and in January arrived at an investor meeting in Las Vegas wearing work boots. One of the former Intel employees described Krzanich as the worst-dressed guy in a meeting, “but in a good way.” “He doesn’t worry too much about the impression he leaves with you. But you pay attention to what he has to say,” said RBC analyst Doug Freedman. Intel’s strength has traditionally come from its manufacturing prowess, and Krzanich’s promotion is seen as confirmation by the board that the company’s multibillion-dollar network of cutting-edge factories still holds the key to success. People who have dealt with “B.K.,” his handle inside the company, describe him as well aware of own limitations outside of manufacturing, like dealing with customers, but willing to consult with trusted others and make quick decisions based on their recommendations. Perhaps for that reason, Intel Chairman Andy Bryant on Thursday stressed that the new CEO will work closely with new president and former software honcho, Renee James, and team up to push new markets, including smartphones and tablets. After becoming COO, Krzanich told Reuters in a March 2012 interview that he had devoted a couple of years to learning to manage the product-design engineers outside of Intel’s factories. “Managing them like the factory would be one of the worst things I could do for Intel. They need creativity. It’s very different from the factory role.” Krzanich seems to play well with others. He stood out at an offsite executive-training course he attended for several days around a decade ago, according to two consultants who helped organize it. “When you observed him on the team working with his peers he was a leader, but not because he was a dominating, hard-ass guy. He was a good team player,” said Noel Tichy, who is also a business professor at the University of Michigan. “What Brian brought was a level of depth. He went deep on the data. I remember conversations with him about his analysis, and moving the team through the analytic phase of the work. He had an opportunity to really help shape some of the team’s thinking,” said consultant Chris DeRose. Krzanich began his Intel career soon after college at a chip factory in New Mexico in 1982. He acquired responsibility for his first factory, in Chandler, Arizona, in 1996. After running the company’s assembly and testing facilities, in 2007 he was put in charge of the global network of factories as well as the chipmaker’s supply chain. His promotion to COO in January last year added human resources and IT to his responsibilities. CEOs Mark Durcan of Micron Technology and Mike Splinter of Applied Materials on Thursday lauded Krzanich for his profound knowledge of the industry. One reservation was voiced by Henri Richard, senior vice president of commercial sales at SanDisk and a former executive of Intel rival AMD. Making changes to long-held Intel practices, he said, may be one of Krzanich’s biggest challenges because of loyalty to the old guard. “He’s going to fall in the category of ‘not a bad choice’,” said Richard, who has never met Krzanich. “But I think the market had appetite for the implied bigger change that would have come with an external CEO.” ",5032013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-intel-krzanich/run-silent-run-deep-the-life-of-brian-krzanich-at-intel-idUSBRE9420WG20130503
485,INTC,Intel revamps Atom chips in bid to find mobile footing,"SANTA CLARA, California (Reuters) - Intel Corp on Monday unveiled the most extensive overhaul of its Atom mobile processors, with improved performance that the PC chipmaker expects will help it challenge Qualcomm in smartphones and tablets. The new microarchitecture, code-named Silvermont, will be a key building block in upcoming Intel chips for mobile gadgets, microservers and car entertainment systems, Chief Product Officer Dadi Perlmutter told reporters at an event on Monday. “We have not only reduced the power in a significant manner but it comes with significant performance,” Perlmutter said. Intel’s chips dominate the PC industry but the company has struggled to adapt its processors for smartphones and tablets, a market dominated by Qualcomm. The Silvermont microarchitecture is analogous to redesigning an automobile engine that will be used a range of car models with different features, Perlmutter said. He said it offers up to three times more computing performance than current chips and as much as five times lower power consumption. Qualcomm and other mobile chipmakers design their processors using power-efficient technology licensed from Intel-rival ARM Holdings. Intel introduced its Atom mobile processors for netbooks in 2008 and they have so far failed to be widely adopted in smartphones and tablets despite improvements made to them. Silvermont will be the basis for Intel’s 22-nanometer Bay Trail tablet chips due out later this year and Intel says it will more than double the performance of its current tablet chips. It will also be used in Intel’s upcoming Merrifield smartphone chips and Avoton chips for microservers. While Silvermont improves the performance of Intel’s processors, the Santa Clara, California company faces other major challenges in mobile. It has fallen behind in launching chips with Long Term Evolution, or LTE, a high-speed wireless technology already offered by Qualcomm and increasingly found in smartphones launched in the United States, including Apple’s iPhone and Samsung’s Galaxy line.

489,INTC,New CEO vows Intel will be more responsive in mobile push,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp’s new CEO Brian Krzanich said on Thursday that under his leadership the top chipmaker will be more responsive to customers in an intensified focus on the fast-growing smartphone and tablet market where it lags its rivals. Krzanich took over as chief executive at Intel’s annual shareholders meeting, replacing Paul Otellini, who in November unexpectedly announced his plan to retire. Under Otellini, Intel has been sidelined in smartphones and tablets while demand for its PC processors is on the wane. “Yes, we missed it, we were slow to tablets and some of the mobile computing. We do believe we have a good base,” Krzanich told shareholders at an annual meeting. Krzanich, a 30-year Intel veteran who made his name running Intel’s cutting-edge manufacturing plants, said he and software honcho Renee James, who the board elevated to president, have already started meeting with manufacturing customers. “They’re all showing us - here’s where the market’s moving and here’s where we need Intel to move,” Krzanich said. “We’re going to make adjustments in our architecture and our product choices.” Intel for decades has called the shots in the personal computer industry but it was slow to react to the explosion of smartphones and tablets, markets now dominated by competitors like Qualcomm and Samsung Electronics, which design their chips using architecture licensed from ARM Holdings Plc. Intel’s strength has traditionally come from its manufacturing prowess, and Krzanich’s promotion is seen as confirmation by the board that the company’s multibillion-dollar network of cutting-edge factories still holds the key to success. James’ promotion underscores a belief in Intel that software and other related services are also important ingredients. “I think the emphasis is important,” Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said of Krzanich’s remarks. “A focus on the end-customer, a focus on execution and a really strong focus on the ultra-mobile segment of the business. That’s pretty important,” Smith told Reuters. Last week, Intel unveiled the most extensive overhaul to date of its Atom mobile processors that underpin its push into smartphones and tablets. Intel’s processors have been used in a handful of smartphones in Asia, Africa and Europe but the company has yet to release Long Term Evolution, or LTE, a high-speed wireless technology already offered by Qualcomm and increasingly found in smartphones launched in the United States, including Apple’s iPhone and Samsung’s Galaxy line.

490,INTC,"UPDATE 4-Intel CEO shakes up units, creates 'new devices' group","By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, May 21 (Reuters) - Intel Corp’s new chief executive, Brian Krzanich, has launched a sweeping company reorganization and created a unit aimed at growing its market share in mobile technology. The shakeup, announced internally just days after the 30-year veteran took the helm, places most of the main product groups of the world’s top chipmaker directly under the CEO’s supervision and hands its sprawling global manufacturing operation to new president Renee James, said a source close to the company, who declined to be identified. Details of the reorganization were outlined in an internal memo sent to employees on Monday. It was described to Reuters by a company source and details of the reorganization, which is effective immediately, were confirmed by spokesman Chuck Mulloy on Tuesday. “As your CEO I am committed to making quick, informed decisions. I am committed to being bolder, moving faster, and accepting that this means changes will be made knowing that we will listen, learn and then make adjustments in order to keep pace with a rapidly changing industry,” Krzanich said in the email, according to the source. “Our business faces significant challenges, and we simply must continue to execute while finalizing our future strategy,” he reportedly wrote. Krzanich officially took over as CEO last week and said that under his leadership, the top chipmaker will be more responsive to customers in an intensified focus on the fast-growing smartphone and tablet market where it lags rivals. The chipmaker’s main product groups - including the PC client group, mobile communications and data center unit that previously reported to Intel Architecture group chief Dadi Perlmutter - now report directly to Krzanich. After Perlmutter transfers his business groups, he and Krzanich will “define his next significant contribution at Intel,” according to the email described by the source. Intel has called the shots in the personal computer industry for decades, but it was slow to react to the explosion of smartphones and tablets. The latter two markets are now dominated by competitors like Qualcomm Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, which design their chips using architecture licensed from ARM Holdings Plc. In his three-decade career at Intel, Krzanich has become known for making fast decisions after consulting with trusted lieutenants. This week’s reorganization is Krzanich’s first step in a process aimed at making Intel more focused and more agile, Mulloy said. Mike Bell will head up Intel’s newly formed “new devices” group,” which Mulloy said will focus on emerging product trends. “The new devices organization is responsible for rapidly turning brilliant technical and business model innovations into products that shape and lead markets,” Krzanich said in the email, according to the source. James, formerly head of the software arm, will now also oversee the company’s sprawling global manufacturing operations and all aspects of security technology. Mulloy said Intel presidents have traditionally been responsible for managing the manufacturing operations. James will also lead corporate strategy and planning. Her  previous job as Intel’s software chief has been taken over by Doug Fisher, a senior executive from that group. Hermann Eul previously shared responsibility for Intel’s mobile communications group, which makes smartphone chips, with Bell, and he will now take full responsibility for that business. Senior Intel executives in the past have privately warned against focusing too much on catching up in smartphones and tablets at the expense of missing out on future trends in mobile. Krzanich’s creation of the “new devices” group signals he is also looking beyond today’s gadgets. “It’s a matter of what they do with the new division, what can they identify and then deliver that maybe would not have otherwise been something we’d see Intel inside of. It could be very meaningful if they can execute,” said Williams Financial analyst Cody Acree. Venture capital fund Intel Capital, led by Arvind Sodhani, now reports to Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith instead of to the CEO. Intel’s IT department, which reported to Krzanich before his appointment as CEO, will also now report to Smith.

Samsung has chosen Intel’s Clover Trail+ mobile chip for at least one version of its Galaxy Tab 3 10.1, which competes with Apple Inc’s iPad, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity because the specifications have not been announced. Samsung has previously used chips designed with energy-efficient technology from the UK’s ARM Holdings  for its best-selling mobile devices. It employs Intel processors for its line of Microsoft Windows “ATIV” tablets — a much smaller market compared with devices based on Google Inc’s  Android. Samsung will unveil new ATIV tablets using Intel chips at a June 20 event in London, said the source, as well as an additional person familiar with the event. It was unclear whether the Galaxy Tab would debut at the same event. The Asian electronics giant’s decision to begin using Intel  in a marquee Android device counts as a coup for the US chipmaker as it races to establish itself in a mobile market it was slow initially to recognize and invest in.

Its decision to begin using Intel in a marquee Android device is a coup for the U.S. chipmaker as it races to establish itself in a mobile market it was slow initially to recognize and invest in. Samsung’s announcement confirms an earlier Reuters story and media reports on May 30. Samsung has previously used chips designed with energy-efficient technology from the UK’s ARM Holdings  for its best-selling mobile devices. The South Korean firm unveiled two new tablets on Monday, an 8-inch tablet and the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1-inch, which uses Intel chips. The 10.1-inch tablet, which competes with Apple Inc’s  iPad, will be powered by Intel’s 1.6-GHz dual core processor and run the latest version of Google Inc’s  Android operating system. Intel called the shots in the personal computer industry for decades, but was slow to make chips that appealed to makers of smartphones and tablets as the market boomed following the release of Apple’s iPhone in 2007 and iPad in 2010.

500,INTC,Intel sees tablet-chip efforts paying off this year,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Intel Corp is ramping up its efforts to have more of its chips used in mobile devices, a market it was initially slow to respond to, as officials said on Monday they expect more than 30 tablets using its processors hitting the market this year. Samsung Electronics Co announced on Monday it will use Intel’s processors to power a new version of one of its top-tier Android tablets, while Asustek Computer Inc also showcased tablet and phablet designs using Intel chips. Both moves are considered a breakthrough for the U.S. chipmaker. “We’re seeing some really great momentum in our customers. We got over 30 tablet designs already on, across Android and Windows, and we expect to have them for the holidays,” Gregory Bryant, Intel’s Asia Pacific vice president and general manager said in an interview on Tuesday at the Computex trade show in Taiwan. The Santa Clara, California-based company for decades has called the shots in the personal computer industry, but it was slow to react to the explosion of smartphones and tablets, markets now dominated by competitors like Qualcomm Inc and Samsung Electronics, which have been using chip architecture licensed from ARM Holdings Plc. Early last month, Intel unveiled the most extensive overhaul to date of its Atom mobile processors that underpin its push into smartphones and tablets. Intel is also betting on other developments in the industry and its Intel Capital unit announced on Tuesday a $100 million fund to invest in gesture-control and “perceptual” computing companies. “I’m very bullish on perceptual computing. Not just touch and voice, as you get things like 3D camera solutions...how you can interact with technology, how a child can interact with a book on a computer and on 3D gesture driven mode. I think it’s going to be popular in time,” he said. Intel also unveiled its fourth generation processor on Tuesday, which is built to be used in 2-in-1 designs like those used for convertible computers that can go from a notebook to a tablet. Intel says the new processor, based on its flagship 22-nanometer Haswell microarchitecture, can provide a 50 percent improvement in battery life and provide twice the graphics capability. Intel said in April its current-quarter revenue would decline as much as 8 percent and it trimmed its 2013 capital spending plans as personal computer sales drop due to the growing popularity of tablets and smartphones.

502,INTC,Intel offers to pay up for Internet TV programming deals,"(Reuters) - Intel Corp’s talks to buy content from media companies for its new TV service are advancing, and the chipmaker is offering to pay as much as 75 percent more than traditional cable rates, people familiar with the talks said. But Intel has yet to close any programming deals, said the sources, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to comment. CBS, News Corp and Viacom have reached agreements with Intel on certain details over how their content would be distributed on the service the chipmaker plans to begin later this year, one person familiar with the situation said. Comcast’s NBC Universal is continuing its talks with Intel but its negotiations are not as advanced others companies, said another source familiar with the matter. Intel has moved substantially on subscriber fees it is willing to pay since the negotiations began, one source said. It has also suggested preventing viewers from skipping commercials on the first run of a show, said another source. Representatives for Viacom, NBC, CBS, News Corp, Disney’s ABC and Time Warner declined to comment. Media companies typically give better prices to operators with more viewers, such as large cable companies, and charge higher prices to smaller or newer entrants. Since Intel’s TV service has yet to start, and therefore has no viewers, it can expect to pay a premium, all the sources said. SNL Kagan, a research firm that measures and publishes the average subscriber fees cable and satellite TV operators pay for television networks, recorded last year’s highest fees were $5.15 per subscriber per month and were charged by Disney’s ESPN. While it was not clear exactly what amounts Intel had originally offered for specific channels, sources said the tech company was basing its 50 to 75 percent premium on listed average SNL Kagan subscriber fees. Intel needs deals with the top five or six U.S. media companies to secure most of the popular TV channels, according to one source. Intel said in February that it planned to compete with Apple, Amazon and Google and provide a set-top box and service that would offer live and on-demand programming. Erik Huggers, the head of Intel Media, has said he plans to offer customers smaller bundles of content than those currently being offered by cable and satellite operators. While Intel has not said how much it plans to charge for its TV service, Huggers has billed it as a premium product, rather than a cut-rate option for consumers hoping to save money by canceling their cable subscriptions. Higher prices for consumers would give Intel breathing room to pay more to media companies without sacrificing its own margins. Intel spokesman Jon Carvill said the chipmaker still plans to launch its TV service this year, but declined to give details of negotiations with media companies. Having missed the mobile revolution and fallen behind in making chips for smartphones and tablets, Intel senior executives are eager to be on the leading edge of future consumer technologies. Intel sees the living room as a potential battleground, where its advanced chips, used in set-top boxes and to power “cloud” data centers, can give it an advantage and help set the standard for other home entertainment products.

505,INTC,"ARM sees strength in numbers against Intel, Nvidia","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chip designer ARM ARM.L said the size and depth of its partner network across hardware and software gave it an edge in mobile technology that top chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) and new graphics rival Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) would struggle to match. Incoming chief executive Simon Segars said the British company’s power efficient technology was deeply embedded in smartphones and tablets because it was licensed so widely, saving chipmakers development costs and ensuring compatibility. ARM licenses its technology to partners like Qualcomm (QCOM.O), Nvidia, Broadcom BRCM.O and MediaTek, which use the blueprints to make their own chips. ARM-based chips are used in nearly all smartphones and tablets, but the company faces growing competition from Intel, which was slow to react to the mobile revolution but is showing signs of becoming competitive. Last month the U.S. chipmaker unveiled Silvermont, the most extensive overhaul of its Atom mobile processors to date. Intel’s stock has risen about 5 percent since it gave an overview of the new technology, while ARM’s shares have fallen around 19 percent. The U.S. chipmaker also scored a major victory earlier this month when Samsung said it would use an Intel mobile chip to power its Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 inch tablet. Segars said ARM had always expected Intel to gain some design wins, but he said the British company would retain the largest share of the mobile market. “We have always considered (Intel) to be a formidable company,” he said at the Reuters Global Technology Summit in San Francisco. But he said ARM was developing products that delivered the right performance at the lowest possible power consumption by focusing on the whole system, including how data moved around the chip and how the processor and graphics interacted. “We think that what we are doing in terms of that roadmap - the execution, the way we work with our partners - keeps our technology ahead,” he said on Wednesday. ARM unveiled its newest line of processors, the Cortex A-12, earlier this month, aimed at the fast growing $200-$350 smartphone segment, which the company says will number half a billion devices by 2015. It also launched a partner line in its Mali graphics processors and it first video processing technology, and the designs to join them all together. It has been gaining share in graphics, at the expense of companies like Britain’s Imagination Technology IMG.L, but it faces a new competitor in Nvidia, a company synonymous with graphics chips. Nvidia’s Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang told the Reuters Global Technology Summit on Tuesday that his company would license its technology to other chipmakers to take greater advantage of the booming market for mobile computing. Segars said that, like in main processors, the strength of its graphic solution lay in its compatibility with the rest of the ARM ecosystem. “We think we have a pretty solid line of GPUs (Graphics Processing Units),” he said. “It’s about doing a great job of implementation, technical synergy with the rest of the key building blocks in the processor, and I think us doing all of that together means we can hopefully deliver a great solution to our customers.” Segars, who is currently based in California, has worked at ARM for 22 years. He takes over from Warren East on July 1. It is the first change at the top since 2001, but Segars said he was not planning any big overhauls. He said the collegiate atmosphere of the company, which reflects its base in the university city of Cambridge in east England, was a strength he wanted to retain. “For me, the priority is keep doing what we are doing because we do it well and make sure we capitalize on the new opportunities that we see,” he said.

McAfee, an American who helped create the anti-virus software industry, generated a media frenzy at the end of last year when he fled his home on a tropical island in Belize, claiming that police in the Central American nation wanted to frame him for murder. He has begun producing a series of YouTube videos, the first of which lampoons the McAfee anti-virus software company that he founded in the late 1980s and that is now owned by Intel Corp. He has not worked for the business in more than 15 years. The video, which surfaced this week, shows him complaining about the difficulties of removing McAfee anti-virus software from computers, and reading what he claims are letters of complaint from those who have used it. He says that the software was beautiful before it fell out of his hands. In the video, McAfee uses a lot of vulgar language, purports to snort a powder and fire a gun into a computer, and is undressed and pawed by a group of young women. He said he did it all to mock the media’s unfair portrayal of him as a mad man. “I did the best I could at a paranoid rant,” he said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. ATTACK “LUDICROUS”-COMPANY McAfee said he made the video because he really does get harassed by McAfee software customers. “I was tired of seeing references to ‘Please hang this man because he has created the worst software in the world,’” he said. Ian Bain, a spokesman for the McAfee software company, declined to say whether the company might pursue legal action. “While we take any attack on our products seriously, these ludicrous statements have no basis in reality,” he said. “We continue to focus on what matters: our customers.” John McAfee said that he is now living in Portland, Oregon, though he has spent the past few days in Montreal working on a film documentary about his life, which he expects will be released before the end of the year. He said he is also in negotiations with Hollywood studios over a feature film about his life. When he returns to Portland, he plans to get started on his next YouTube video - a satire of The Dr. Phil Show and its host Phil McGraw. Why pick on Dr. Phil? “Dr. Phil has been pounding on my door, pleading me to be on his show. But I am not an idiot,” McAfee said. A spokesman for the show said he had no immediate comment. McAfee fled his home in Belize, disguised himself and went into hiding after his American neighbor Gregory Faull was fatally shot in November in the Central American country. He made his way secretly to Guatemala, but was then deported to Miami in December. He said that police in Belize were persecuting him because he refused to pay $2 million in bribes, and that the extortion attempt occurred after armed soldiers shot his dog, smashed up his property and falsely accused him of running a methamphetamine laboratory. Belize police spokesman Raphael Martinez said on Wednesday that McAfee remains a person of interest in the ongoing murder investigation and is wanted for questioning. “Nothing has changed,” he said. “He’s the only person at this point wanted for questioning.” McAfee said in the interview that he has told police in Belize that he would be happy to answer their questions, but only over the telephone, via video conference or in a neutral country outside of Latin America. “They have refused all of those offers,” he said.

Brian Krzanich, an Intel manufacturing guru who took over as chief executive officer in May, also took a cautious tone about the top chipmaker’s planned foray into television and said Intel continues to look at the business model. “We believe we have a great user interface and the compression-decompression technology is fantastic,” Krzanich said. “But in the end, if we want to provide that service it comes down to content. We are not big content players.” In their first sit-down with reporters since their promotions in May, Krzanich and Intel President Renee James said wearable computing devices would become a key battleground for mobile industry players. Krzanich, who mentioned he had Google’s Glass wearable device in his knapsack, said computing in the next few years would focus more on items for eyes and ears, as well as wristbands and watches. “I think you’ll start to see stuff with our silicon toward the end of the year and the beginning of next year,” Krzanich said. “We’re trying to get our silicon into some of them, create some ourselves, understand the usage and create an ecosystem.” The world’s biggest chipmaker dominates the PC industry, but has been slow to adapt its chips to be suitable for smartphones and tablets. Intel is anxious to make sure it does not fall behind in future technology trends. Krzanich and James said that under their leadership, Intel will give much more priority to its Atom mobile chips. In the past, Intel’s most cutting-edge manufacturing resources were reserved for making powerful PC chips, with Atom chips made on older production lines. “We see that Atom is now at the same importance, it’s launching on the same leading edge technology, sometimes even coming before Core (Intel’s line of PC chips),” said Krzanich. “We are in the process of looking at all of our roadmaps and evaluating the timing of some of those products. It’s fair to say there are things we would like to accelerate.” James said Intel would grow its small contract chip manufacturing business, a potentially significant source of revenues. As did his predecessor, Krzanich left open the possibility of opening Intel’s factories to customers making chips designed with architectures that compete against Intel’s own. Apple Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and other smartphone manufacturers favor processors designed with architecture licensed by Britain’s ARM Holdings Plc, a trend Intel would like to reverse. Wall Street has speculated in recent years that Intel could strike a deal to manufacture Apple’s iPhone chips. “If there was a great customer that we had a great relationship with laptops and other mobile devices, and they said look, we’d really love you to build our ARM-based product, we’d consider it. It depends on how strategic they are,” Krzanich said. Krzanich, a three-decade Intel veteran, said he changes laptops and smartphones about once a month to try new ones out. He is currently using a Samsung Galaxy phone and a Lenovo Helix laptop with a detachable keyboard. Under previous CEO Paul Otellini, Intel embarked on a plan to launch an Internet television service with live and on-demand content, entering a hotly competitive race outside its core chip business. While Intel has said it expects to launch its service later this year, as of earlier this month it had not yet finalized programming deals with major content companies. It faces competition from Apple, Amazon and Google, as well as traditional cable companies. “We’re being cautious. We’re experts in silicon, we’re experts in mobility, in driving Moore’s law,” Krzanich said. “But we are not experts in the content industry and we’re being careful.” Processors based on technology from ARM and designed by Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O>, Samsung and Nvidia Corp account for most of the mobile market. But Intel has shown some recent signs of improvement in mobile, progress Krzanich is keen to build on. Samsung has chosen an Intel processor for one of its top-tier Android tablets for the first time.

One of the buildings at the sprawling processing plant was evacuated after the leak of gas, which was identified as nitrogen triflouride, said Battalion Chief Tom Dwiggins, a fire department spokesman. A spokesman for Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, said the source of the leak was a single manufacturing tool in one of the company’s silicon wafer fabrication facilities. Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said the tool that caused the leak has been taken offline and operations at the plant have resumed as the company tries to determine the cause of the malfunction. “There is no ongoing danger,” Mulloy said. Dwiggins said there was no threat to nearby neighborhoods. “They monitored the air inside and outside the structure and in all cases the air was clean,” he said. The plant manufactures silicon wafers used to make semiconductors for computers. The components are made on 12 inch silicon wafers that are later sliced into individual components, according to the spokesman. Each component can contain more than a billion transistors. Mulloy and Dwiggins said 43 people were treated at the scene, and as many as 11 individuals were taken to a hospital for further evaluation. Those transported to hospitals were suffering from conditions including difficulty breathing, nausea and skin and eye irritation, said Dwiggins. About 75 firefighters were called to the campus early on Saturday after a worker complained of difficulty breathing and then others began experiencing symptoms, Dwiggins said. The plant in Chandler employs about 11,000 people. Intel operates two high-volume semiconductor manufacturing facilities at the site and is building a third facility, which is scheduled to open this year, according to the company website.

The recent gains have reassured investors, who worried that a strong jobs report could trigger a negative reaction from the market. Data on Friday showed the economy added a greater than expected 195,000 new jobs last month. Strong economic data increases the likelihood the Federal Reserve will start to reduce its $85-billion-per-month in monetary stimulus in the near future.

517,INTC,Intel cuts 2013 revenue forecast as PC industry sags,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) cut its full-year revenue forecast and said it is scaling back capital spending as it adjusts to a painful contraction of personal computer sales and economic weakness in China, one of its biggest markets. The forecast and cut in capital spending were announced on Wednesday in the company’s quarterly earnings report, the first under new Chief Executive Brian Krzanich. The soft-spoken manufacturing guru, who took over as CEO in May and faces falling PC sales and a hyper-competitive mobile market, was quick to acknowledge Intel’s past errors. He said the top chipmaker would aggressively speed up the rollout of new Atom mobile chips. “Intel was slow to respond to the ultra-mobile PC trends,” Krzanich said. “We will move Atom even faster to our leading-edge silicon technology.” Within days of taking over in May, Krzanich launched a sweeping company reorganization. He has also been spending a lot of time with manufacturing customers, meetings that will quickly lead to more mobile business for Intel, Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told Reuters. Intel dominates the PC industry, but it has been slow to make its chips suitable for smartphones and tablets. Smith said that in the fast-expanding mobile market, where Qualcomm (QCOM.O) is the leading chip supplier, customers want more options. “They want alternatives in a market kind of becoming dominated by one player and they see us as being a very capable supplier,” Smith said. “They wanted to look Brian in the eye, and now he’s looking back and saying ‘We’re going to double our efforts here.’” Smith, said in an earlier interview on CNBC that the chipmaker had seen softer sales in China than it had anticipated. Faced with slow demand, Intel said it was cutting 2013 capital spending to $11 billion, plus or minus $500 million. The cut follows a similar reduction from $13 billion to $12 billion in April. Intel said it expects 2013 revenue to be flat from the year before. Last quarter Intel forecast a low single digit percentage increase in 2013. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon compared Intel’s reduction of expectations on Wednesday to a similar “reset” in 2012. “Last year, they had a come-to-Jesus moment two-thirds of the way through Q3. This time at least they seem to be reacting a bit sooner, but you have to ask if it’s enough,” Rasgon said. Global shipments of personal computers dropped 11 percent in the second quarter, the fifth straight quarterly decline in a market that has been devastated by the popularity of tablets. Intel has shown some recent signs of improvement in mobile, progress Krzanich is eager to build on. Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) has chosen an Intel processor for one of its top-tier Android tablets for the first time. And in May, the U.S. chipmaker unveiled Silvermont, the most extensive overhaul of its mobile processors to date, with improved performance and lower power consumption that some experts believe might help it compete better against Qualcomm. Shares of Intel have risen about 16 percent this year and trade at the equivalent of 12 times expected earnings, a valuation similar to that of Qualcomm’s stock. Krzanich left open the possibility of opening Intel’s factories to more customers making chips designed with architectures that differ from Intel’s own, a side business that so far has remained very small. Wall Street has speculated in recent years that Intel could strike a deal to manufacture Apple’s (AAPL.O) iPhone chips. “We are taking each customer individually and looking at them as an opportunity and what is the right thing for the shareholders,” he said. Intel posted second-quarter revenue of $12.8 billion and said revenue in the current quarter would be $13.5 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts expected $12.896 billion in revenue for the second quarter and $13.732 billion for the current quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. For the second quarter, Intel reported net earnings of $2.0 billion, or 39 cents a share, in line with expectations. That compared with $2.827 billion, or 54 cents, in the same quarter last year. Shares of Intel fell about 4 percent in extended trade after closing down 0.41 percent at $24.15 on the Nasdaq.

518,INTC,US STOCKS-Wall St gets a lift from Bernanke's flexible Fed view,"* Yahoo’s stock jumps to highest intraday level since May 2008 * Bank of America shares climb after earnings * American Express shares extend drop after the bell on results * Intel and eBay shares slip, but IBM up in after-hours trading * Dow up 0.1 pct, S&P; 500 up 0.3 pct, Nasdaq up 0.3 pct By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended modestly higher on Wednesday after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the timeline for winding down the U.S. central bank’s stimulus program was not set in stone. Shares of Bank of America and Yahoo rose after the companies reported quarterly results. Both ranked among the names giving the biggest boost to the S&P; 500. The three major U.S. stock indexes bounced back from Tuesday’s lower close, which broke the S&P; 500’s eight-day string of gains. Bernanke said the U.S. central bank still expects to start scaling back its massive bond-buying program later this year, but he said the timeline depended on the economic outlook.  He made the comments on Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee as part of his twice-yearly report to Congress on monetary policy. On Thursday, he will appear before the Senate Banking Committee. “He’s still being quite vague in describing exactly what to expect next, and I think that serves his purposes. He’s trying to minimize the impact of policy change on the markets,” said Lawrence Creatura, portfolio manager at Federated Investors in Rochester, New York. Bernanke’s comments on May 22 triggered a drop of nearly 6 percent in the S&P; 500 in the month that followed. But remarks from Bernanke and other Fed officials since then have calmed the market and erased those declines. The S&P; 500 is just several points away from the all-time intraday high of 1,687.18 it reached on May 22. For the year, the S&P; 500 is up 17.9 percent. Yahoo shares shot up 10.3 percent to close at $29.66. Earlier, Yahoo hit an intraday high at $29.73, its highest level since May 2008. Instead of Yahoo’s bottom-line results, investors focused more on news of its stake in the fast-growing Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba and its product development efforts. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 18.67 points, or 0.12 percent, to end at 15,470.52. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 4.65 points, or 0.28 percent, to finish at 1,680.91. The Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 11.50 points, or 0.32 percent, to close at 3,610.00. Bank of America shares gained 2.8 percent to $14.31, while BNY Mellon Corp shares rose 1.9 percent at $30.92. Both led the financial sector higher after the banks reported stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings.   The S&P; financial sector index  advanced 0.5 percent. “One reason investors might be encouraged by earnings is that management teams have done a great job of setting expectations, and right now, the bar is set at ankle height,” Creatura said. “So it should be reasonably easy for companies to beat expectations this quarter, and that could be a positive catalyst for markets.” Analysts expect S&P; 500 companies’ second-quarter earnings to have grown 3.3 percent from a year earlier, with revenue up 1.2 percent, Thomson Reuters data showed. On the flip side, shares of American Express fell 1.9 percent to $76.80 after the European Commission said it would propose limits on fees that banks can charge to process debit-card and credit-card transactions. During the regular session, American Express was the Dow’s biggest percentage decliner. After the bell, American Express shares slid 1 percent to $76 after the company reported results. In other trading after the bell, shares of Intel  fell 3.3 percent to $23.35 after the world’s biggest chipmaker cut its full-year revenue forecast and said it is scaling back capital spending. Shares of eBay dropped 6.2 percent to $53.80 in extended-hours trading after the e-commerce company reported solid second-quarter results, but warned of “headwinds” in the second half of the year from Europe and Korea. In contrast, shares of IBM rose almost 3 percent in extended-hours trading after IBM raised its full-year earnings forecast and reported second-quarterly earnings that beat estimates. During the regular session, IBM’s stock rose 0.4 percent to end at $194.55. During the regular session, shares of DuPont jumped 5.3 percent to $57.25 after Trian Fund Management’s Nelson Peltz said he has amassed a “big stake” in the chemicals maker. The stock was the Dow’s top percentage gainer. Part of the day’s upbeat tone came from the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, which said the U.S. economy continued to grow at a modest to moderate pace in June and early July, with manufacturing expanding in most areas of the country. Volume was roughly 5.7 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and the NYSE MKT, below the average daily closing volume of about 6.4 billion this year.

Shares of Morgan Stanley jumped 4.4 percent to $27.70, its highest close since April 2011, after the bank posted a 42 percent increase in quarterly profit as stock trading revenue soared. The S&P; financial index climbed 1.3 percent. Of the 21 financial companies that have reported quarterly earnings so far, 76 percent have surpassed analysts’ estimates, Thomson Reuters data showed. UnitedHealth shares rallied, buoying the Dow and other health insurers’ stocks. UnitedHealth gained 6.5 percent to $70.55 after the company’s results beat expectations.

Bernanke, speaking before the Senate Banking Committee, reiterated comments he made on Wednesday to the House Financial Services Committee. He stressed that the timeline for winding down the Fed’s stimulus program was not set in stone. “We got no negative surprises from the Fed chairman today, so the market liked that,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president of BB&T; Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. Thursday’s session marked the first time that both the Dow and the S&P; 500 set intraday record highs since May 22. On that same day, the rally was interrupted when Bernanke hinted that the Fed planned to begin pulling back its stimulus. His comments triggered a sharp selloff, leading to a drop of nearly 6 percent in the S&P; 500 over the next month. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 78.02 points, or 0.50 percent, to end at 15,548.54, a record high.

Shares of Google fell 4.9 percent to $865.73 following the release of its earnings, which reflected a drop in its online ad prices. Google ended the regular session down 0.9 percent at $910.68. Microsoft shares also fell after the close. The stock was down 4.5 percent at $33.85 after it reported lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. Slow personal computer sales hurt its Windows business, Microsoft said. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices slid 3.5 percent to $4.48 in extended-hours trading following the chipmaker’s results.

527,INTC,UPDATE 1-TSMC says shift to cheaper smartphones to support chip sales growth,"(Adds Q3 outlook, chairman’s comments) * Q2 net profit up 23.8 pct to record high, beats expectations * Sees Q3 revenue rise on mid- to low-end smartphone sales * Sees inventory correction in Q3, suppressing margins By Clare Jim TAIPEI, July 18 (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd said it expects sales of cheaper mobile devices in emerging markets like China to boost its earnings in the second half, brushing off concerns over slowing demand for high-end smartphones. TSMC, the world’s top contract chip maker, has been riding on robust demand for its chips made with 28-nanometre process technology, which crams more computing power into smaller micro-circuits, as consumers shift from clunky personal computers and laptops to smartphones and tablets like Apple Inc’s iPad. The company said on Thursday it expects third-quarter revenue to rise to between T$161 billion and T$164 billion ($5.4 billion and $5.5 billion), from T$155.9 billion in the previous quarter. “Contributions from China to our total business will be doubled this year from last year,” TSMC Chairman Morris Chang told an investor conference. Chang said shipments of low- and mid-level smartphones would grow 69 percent and 36 percent respectively in 2013 from from a year ago, compared with 18 percent growth for top-tier handsets. However, supply chain inventory in the third quarter would be higher than expected three months ago as integrated circuit design companies prepared for major smartphone launches. As a result, TSMC lowered its forecast for full-year semiconductor industry revenue growth by 1 percentage point to 3 percent, but lifted its foundry revenue growth forecast by 1 percentage point to 11 percent. Chief financial officer Lora Ho said an inventory correction in the third quarter would put pressure on margins. The company, which controls half of the $34.6 billion global contract chip market, said its second-quarter net profit rose 23.8 percent from a year ago to a record T$51.81 billion ($1.7 billion), beating forecasts. TSMC’s clients include Qualcomm Inc, Texas Instruments Inc and Nvidia Corp. In turn, these firms sell chips to consumer electronics companies like South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Taiwan’s HTC Corp as well as Apple. Samsung Electronics and HTC earlier this month posted second-quarter earnings that fell short of forecasts, deepening worries that the market for expensive smartphones may have peaked in the absence of must-have innovations.  [ID:ID:nL3N0F91WF] Intel Corp, which makes its own chips but has started to get into the contract making business, cut its full-year revenue forecast on Wednesday.

528,INTC,"GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian shares fall on China, Intel; dollar rises after Bernanke","* Dollar extends modest overnight gains after Bernanke remarks * Intel cuts 2013 revenue f’cast, capex * European index futures signal weaker open * China shares down on financing concerns By Dominic Lau TOKYO, July 18 (Reuters) - Asian shares fell on Thursday, as concerns over financing available to property developers hurt Chinese markets, although overall sentiment was supported by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke’s pledge to keep monetary policy easy for the foreseeable future. Regional tech-related stocks were hit by U.S. Intel Corp’s  dismal annual revenue forecast and capital spending cuts, rooted in softer personal computer sales and weakness in China, one of its biggest markets. The dollar extended modest overnight gains after Bernanke stuck to a timeline that he first outlined in June to wind down the Federal Reserve’s $85 billion a month bond-buying programme, but he went out of his way to stress that nothing was set in stone. European stock futures eased 0.4 percent, indicating a weaker open, while U.S. S&P; 500 index futures  slipped 0.2 percent ahead of quarterly results from Google, Microsoft and Morgan Stanley, and a weekly jobless claims report. China’s CSI300 share index shed 1.6 percent, hitting a one-week low and lately forming a “death cross” - a bearish signal - with the 50-day moving average breaking below the 200-day moving average. The index has lost nearly 11 percent this year. Speculation swirled in China’s cash market on Thursday of another credit squeeze after an early spike in the overnight rate ahead of imminent tax payments by banks. However, rates quickly fell back amid talk of action by major state-owned banks. The pace of the monthly rise in China’s home prices slowed slightly in June for a third straight month, though the year-on-year gains were the strongest this year, underlining challenges faced by Beijing in its fight to tame housing inflation. “Fears are growing that the liquidity shock a few weeks ago may be starting to trickle into the sector,” said Lee Wee Liat, BNP Paribas head of Asia property. China’s frothy property market is seen by analysts as one of the biggest financial risks to the world’s second-largest economy, along with the run-up of debt by local governments and the explosive growth of the opaque “shadow banking” system. Chinese money market rates have moderated since the central bank allowed short-term borrowing costs to spike to record levels on June 20, bluntly messaging overstretched lenders that it was determined to get risky credit expansion under control. Asian shares, as measured by the MSCI Asia-Pacific ex-Japan index, slipped 0.4 percent, reversing an early rise that let them hover near a five-week high touched on Wednesday. Seoul shares fell 0.6 percent, with index heavyweight Samsung Electronics Co Ltd down 2.1 percent partly due to Intel’s grim outlook, while Taipei’s share index dropped 0.8 percent. Underscoring worries over China’s economic slowdown, Japanese manufacturers’ mood worsened in July for the first time in eight months, a Reuters poll showed. Tokyo’s Nikkei advanced 1.3 percent, however, helped by the yen weakness and a 4 percent rise for SoftBank Corp  after China’s e-commerce Alibaba Group, in which the Japanese mobile operator owns about 30 percent, nearly tripled its net income in the first three months of the year. The dollar gained 0.2 percent against a basket of major currencies, adding to overnight gains after Bernanke’s remarks. The U.S. currency was up 0.5 percent at 100.095 yen, extending the previous session’s 0.5 percent rise versus the yen, while the euro slipped 0.2 percent to $1.30940. Bernanke’s remarks to a U.S. congressional committee contained “something for everybody”, said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. “Bernanke has done a good job of leaving himself plenty of manoeuvre room in terms of policy.” The Fed chief’s comments came as its Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity showed the U.S. economy continued to grow at a modest to moderate pace in June and early July, but U.S. housing data was disappointing. In the commodity markets, gold inched up 0.1 percent after falling 1.3 percent on Wednesday, while copper prices  dipped 0.1 to remained below $7,000 a tonne after falling 1.5 percent in the previous session. Brent crude prices eased 0.1 percent to around $108.50 a barrel after gaining 0.6 percent on Wednesday after data from U.S. Energy Information Administration showed a fall  in American crude stocks.",7182013,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-global/global-markets-asian-shares-fall-on-china-intel-dollar-rises-after-bernanke-idUSL4N0FO02320130718
529,INTC,Intel to launch low-power version of powerful server chips,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel Corp said it is planning to launch a low-power version of its brawny server processors, potentially heading off competitors hoping to expand into the data center with energy efficient-chips based on smartphone technology. Intel has already launched a line of its Atom mobile chips that are tweaked to work as low-power server chips. The announcement, which was made on Monday at an event with industry analysts and media, means Intel will go a step further by offering a low-power version of its powerful Xeon processor with built-in features including connectivity and memory. It also reflects the willingness of CEO Brian Krzanich, who took over in May, to make major changes to how Intel approaches its different markets. By launching lower-power chips for servers, Intel is trying to stay ahead of Advanced Micro Devices, Applied Micro Circuits Corp and other smaller rivals hoping to disrupt the top chipmaker’s dominance of the data center with upcoming components designed with low-power smartphone technology licensed from ARM Holdings. “Intel’s announcements demonstrate they will try to defend their turf against ARM-based servers and specialty processors,” said Pat Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. “Up until today, it was a bit of a guessing game for Intel that today has at least 95-percent server market share.” Diane Bryant, in charge of Intel’s data center business, said the new component, based on the upcoming Broadwell version of Intel’s Xeon high-performance chips, will launch next year. Energy-sipping chips similar to those used in smartphones and tablets lack the horsepower of traditional server processors made by Intel. But data centers that combine many low-power chips instead of just a few heavy-duty processors may provide more computing power for less money and use less electricity. Microservers have yet to gain serious traction with traditional corporate customers like banks and manufacturers, and the potential size of the market remains unclear. The new version of Broadwell is part of Intel’s move to integrate more features onto its chips, like memory and graphics. “System on chips,” as they are known, are already widely used in smartphones and tablets, but less in the data center. Intel is also beginning to make “system on chips” for laptops. Intel dominates the PC and server markets, but it was slow to design chips for the mobile market, where chips using technology from ARM Holdings have become ubiquitous.

Nasdaq rose as tech shares were the strongest sector. The index received the strongest boost by Apple Inc , up 1.8 percent to $511.40. The Fed’s policy of buying large amounts of bonds in an attempt to keep interest rates low has been credited with fueling the stock market’s solid gains in 2013. But many analysts expect that to change at the Fed’s September policy meeting. With little expected this week in the way of economic indicators, market participants are focused on the minutes from the July Fed meeting, due on Wednesday, for possible insights into policymakers’ thinking. Growing concerns about a pullback in the program contributed to the Dow’s largest weekly drop in more than a year last week. In the bond market, the U.S. benchmark 10-year note yield  rose to a two-year high. Trading volume has been light in recent sessions because of  uncertainty over the Fed and few catalysts for investors, who have kept to the sidelines in most sessions. The S&P; 500 has moved in a range of about 3.5 percent between lows and highs  over the past month. “Short-term momentum continues to be to the upside, but the low volume suggests there’s little conviction that could take us up out of the range we’ve been in,” said Andres Garcia-Amaya, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds in New York. “The September meeting is the next big catalyst, and until then there’s nothing that should significantly move the needle.” Apple’s stock extended recent gains, rising to $511.40.

Setting up shop in Los Angeles’ Santa Monica and New York’s Nolita brings Intel closer to the major TV networks and production studios that the world’s biggest chipmaker must strike deals with to gather content for its live and on-demand service, Intel spokesman Jon Carvill said. Opening the offices is a sign that Intel is committed to moving ahead with the venture even though progress making deals has been slow. Some industry insiders have expressed doubts about Intel’s ability to successfully create a business to challenge traditional cable operators. “It suggests that there’s an ongoing level of interest, maybe an incremental positive to their commitment,” said Cody Acree, an analyst at Williams Financial Group. “They have to continue down this path or there’s no hope of being successful.” Intel plans to introduce the TV service, to be delivered through the Internet and a set-top box, this year in a phased rollout in regional markets, Carvill said. In July, Intel Media hired Moe Khosravy, a cloud-computing expert who previously worked at Microsoft Corp and VMWare Inc, as head of software and user experiences. Intel has about 375 people working on the TV business, most of them based at Intel’s headquarters in Santa Clara, California. Doubts about Intel’s commitment to the venture emerged in June after newly appointed Chief Executive Brian Krzanich warned he was taking a cautious approach to television, far from the company’s core business of chip manufacturing. Some content providers have agreed with Intel about how their content would be distributed, but as of June the chipmaker had yet to sign any deals despite offering to pay sizeable premiums over traditional cable rates.

538,INTC,Intel prepares ultra-small chips for Dick Tracy-style gadgets,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel is working on a new line of ultra-small and ultra-low-power microchips for wearable devices like smartwatches and bracelets, a bid by the company to make sure it will be at the crest of the next big technology wave after arriving late to the smartphone and tablet revolution. The new line of chips, called Intel Quark, will ship next year and include an ingestible version aimed at biomedical uses, Intel’s president, Renee James, told reporters late on Monday. The Quark chips will be five times smaller and 10 times more power efficient than Intel’s Atom chips for tablets and smartphones, she said. “We’re very committed to not missing the next big thing,” James said. Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich and James spoke on Tuesday at the company’s annual developer conference in San Francisco, their first major public appearance since their promotion in May, when Paul Otellini stepped aside as chief executive. Krzanich said tablets made with Intel chips and priced at less than $100 would be on store shelves in time for this year’s holiday season. He was flanked by rows of Android and Windows 8 tablets, many of them with attachable keyboards - an effort by Intel to show conference attendees it has made progress in mobile. Intel said the first chips made on its cutting-edge 14 nanometer technology would start production late this year and be available in 2014, helping it extend its competitive lead in manufacturing. Intel’s most advanced chips are currently made with 22 nanometer production technology, which is already more advanced than production lines at Intel rivals like Samsung and TSMC. The world’s biggest chipmaker, Intel dominates the PC industry, but it was slow to adapt its chips to be suitable for smartphones and tablets. Intel’s focus on wearable computing - a trend that for many Americans evokes images of Dick Tracy, the comic strip detective who sported a two-way wrist radio - comes as Silicon Valley eyes sophisticated computerized watches with touch-screens and other high-tech features. Technology companies see wearables as a growth opportunity amid signs that explosive expansion in smartphones shipments since Apple launched its first iPhone in 2007 is receding. Last week, Samsung Electronics launched the Galaxy Gear watch, and Qualcomm, an Intel rival, launched the Toq smartwatch in a bid to showcase its technology to potential manufacturers. Krzanich showed off a prototype watch and clunky bracelet made with the Quark chips. “The idea is not to bring these to market but to come up with devices that our partners can use to develop their own products in this open ecosystem, he said. A three-decade Intel veteran seen as the company’s manufacturing guru, Krzanich has said that under his leadership Intel will give much more priority to its Atom line of mobile chips. In the past, Intel’s most cutting-edge manufacturing resources were reserved for making powerful PC chips, with Atom chips made on older production lines. Processors based on technology from ARM and made by Qualcomm and Samsung account for most of the mobile market. Intel has shown some recent signs of improvement in mobile, progress Krzanich is keen to build on. The company has promised major performance improvements in its new Bay Trail chip for tablets. The Bay Trail chip is based on Intel’s new Silvermont architecture, which is the most extensive overhaul of its mobile processors to date, with improved performance and lower power consumption. Also on Tuesday, Intel launched a new line of its brawny Xeon chips for servers, a market it almost completely dominates. The new server chips have up to 50 percent better performance than previous versions and 45 percent more energy efficiency, Intel said. Intel recently began shipping a low-power line of data center chips based on the Silvermont architecture, part of its strategy to defend its territory from smaller chipmakers hoping to use ARM technology widely used in smartphones to push into the servers.

Despite indications economic growth slowed somewhat in the third quarter, the Fed is seen trimming its monthly asset purchases by $10 billion to $75 billion, with monetary policy remaining widely accommodative - and supportive of equities.

The S&P; 500 is up nearly 2 percent for the week, its largest gain since mid-July. The Dow’s current 3 percent weekly advance is its biggest since the first week of the year.

Retail sales rose 0.2 percent in August, below economists’ expectations of a 0.4 percent increase and the 0.4 percent climb in July. Sales were weaker than expected despite increased demand for automobiles and other big-ticket items and added to other signs that economic growth slowed in the third quarter. In a separate report, producer prices rose 0.3 percent in August, slightly above expectations of a 0.2 percent increase as energy prices rose. However, the Producer Price Index excluding volatile food and energy costs was unchanged. The Fed is widely expected to announce a reduction in stimulus when it ends a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. “These were the two big numbers, the PPI and retail sales and I don’t think either of them change the outlook, which our base case is the Fed goes in and begins the (tapering) process here on the Sept. 17-18 meeting,” said Darrell Cronk, regional chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank in New York. “We’ll do a little bit of moving sideways probably, at least until we see the Fed meeting next week.” The S&P; 500 is up 1.7 percent for the week and has risen in seven of the past eight sessions, as fears about military action by the West against Syria receded and data showed China’s economy may be improving. Later in the session at 9:55 a.m. (1355 GMT), investors will eye the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary consumer sentiment index for September. Economists in a Reuters survey expect a reading of 82.0 compared with 82.1 in the final August report. The Fed currently purchases $85 billion a month in Treasury and mortgage bonds in its effort to stimulate the economy. A  Reuters poll on Monday showed economists at a majority of U.S. primary dealers expect the Fed to announce it will cut its bond purchases by $10 billion. However, some recent economic data, including last week’s disappointing payrolls report, has created some uncertainty surrounding any expected action by the Fed.

546,INTC,Fab times: Taiwan's TSMC thinks big in micro chip race,"TAINAN, Taiwan (Reuters) - Top contract chip maker TSMC may have outsmarted rivals Samsung Electronics Co and Intel Corp in the race to build the tiniest and most powerful chips for smartphones and tablets by building big. As mobile devices get slimmer and demand increases for more data-processing and power-saving features, chip companies are trying to cram more power into tinier chips and are building futuristic factories, or fabs, to meet global demand. At a new site the size of about 20 soccer fields in southern Taiwan, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd is building foundry facilities to manufacture chips smaller than 1/5,000th the size of a human hair. Dozens are embedded into smartphones. TSMC plans to invest T$500 billion ($17 billion) and hire 7,000 workers for the new facilities, where the first 20 nanometer (nm) chips are expected to start rolling off the mass production line sometime early next year. Rivals Intel and Samsung, the world’s No.1 and No.2 chipmaker respectively, are also building capacity, and spending billions of dollars on new fabs to crack into the lucrative business that the Taiwanese firm dominates. “It’s a business (foundry) that will continue to grow solidly on the back of a booming mobile industry, and TSMC will see more players in the market as many are envious of its nearly 50 percent profit margin,” said Doh Hyun-woo, an analyst at Mirae Asset Securities in Seoul. “TSMC remains by far the biggest player in the foundry and it’ll continue to dominate as it’s got the biggest capacity and best foundry technology. But margins are set to come under pressure as it will see more competition from the likes of Samsung.” To keep its position as the world’s top foundry business, Hong Kong-based analyst of Maybank Kim Eng Securities, Warren Lau, says TSMC must invest even more on research and development to boost profitability. Unlike the South Korean and U.S. companies which design and make their own chips, TSMC makes chips for designers who do not have a production factory. Samsung’s major system chip clients are Apple and Qualcomm Inc. TSMC’s clients also include Qualcomm, and other chip designers such as Texas Instruments Inc and Nvidia Corp. In turn, the firms then sell chips to smartphone makers like Samsung, Apple, Taiwan’s HTC Corp, and China’s Huawei Technologies. Intel is new to the foundry business, but has already poached programmable microchip leader Altera from TSMC, winning their contract with 14-nm technology. The California-based company is set to open fabs in Oregon and in Arizona this year to produce microprocessors. However, in July it cut its overall 2013 capital spending plan for the second time to $11 billion from $13 billion at the start of the year as PC demand has slowed. TSMC appears to have staged the biggest coup. Media reports, analysts and industry sources say the company has snatched the Apple contract from Samsung, and that its new 20-nm chips will be used in future iPhones and iPads. In the secretive world of high-tech, there has been no official word on Apple parting company with Samsung. But Apple has made no secret it wants to diversify from Samsung as the two rivals battle for leadership in the smartphone market and contest a rash of patent disputes. TSMC’s sales have shot up 19.3 percent in the first eight months of 2013 compared to a year ago thanks to increased chip sales, and the company will announce September sales on Wednesday. Reporters were given a look rare look inside the high-tech world of nano chip production last week during a visit to a TSMC foundry in southern Taiwan. For security reasons, no photographs or video were allowed. Standing on a site that was a sugar cane field about two decades ago, the fab is the world’s largest logic chip factory and produces 40- and 65-nm chips for low-end smartphones and tablets. In a dimly lit, climate-controlled room, masked engineers dressed in ‘bunny suits’ work with robots assembling wafers. Machines currently outnumber workers 20 to one. By the end of the year, the company envisages that will spread to 75 to one. Before entering the fab, the jumpsuited visitors pass through a “dust-blowing” corridor. “The suits are for protecting the wafer, not you,” TSMC spokesman said ahead of the tour. “Even a single hair or a sneeze will damage our wafer.” Nearby, TSMC’s latest fab will mainly produce 20-nm chips and 3-dimensional 16-nm FinFET chips. The Taiwanese company declined to give details of its new capacity, citing confidentiality reasons. Intel started 22-nm FinFET production two years ago and it will begin small production on 14-nm by the end of this year, while Samsung is expected to also start the same process from late next year. Intel dominates the PC industry, but has been slow to adapt its chips to be suitable for smartphones and tablets. Samsung, the world’s biggest memory chip maker, is renovating its Austin, Texas chip plant with $4 billion investment to boost production of mobile processor chips since last year. It is also building a new system chips plant in South Korea with 2.25 trillion won ($2.10 billion) investment. HSBC analyst Steven Pelayo, who is based in Hong Kong, says that as well outsmarting its rivals by planning large capacity expansion, the company is getting better margin on return. “We just have to acknowledge that the risk is increasing - trying to get the next step of technology out, it’s getting more and more difficult, and competitors are pretty well funded this time,” he said.

But margins are set to come under pressure as it will see more competition from the likes of Samsung.” To keep its position as the world’s top foundry business, Hong Kong-based analyst of Maybank Kim Eng Securities, Warren Lau, says TSMC must invest even more on research and development to boost profitability. Unlike the South Korean and U.S. companies which design and make their own chips, TSMC makes chips for designers who do not have a production factory. Samsung’s major system chip clients are Apple and Qualcomm Inc. TSMC’s clients also include Qualcomm, and other chip designers such as Texas Instruments Inc and Nvidia Corp. In turn, the firms then sell chips to smartphone makers like  Samsung, Apple, Taiwan’s HTC Corp, and China’s Huawei Technologies. Intel is new to the foundry business, but has already poached programmable microchip leader Altera from TSMC, winning their contract with 14-nm technology. The California-based company is set to open fabs in Oregon and in Arizona this year to produce microprocessors. However, in July it cut its overall 2013 capital spending plan for the second time to $11 billion from $13 billion at the start of the year as PC demand has slowed. TSMC appears to have staged the biggest coup. Media reports, analysts and industry sources say the company has snatched the Apple contract from Samsung, and that its new 20-nm chips will be used in future iPhones and iPads. In the secretive world of high-tech, there has been no official word on Apple parting company with Samsung. But Apple has made no secret it wants to diversify from Samsung as the two rivals battle for leadership in the smartphone market and contest a rash of patent disputes. TSMC’s sales have shot up 19.3 percent in the first eight months of 2013 compared to a year ago thanks to increased chip sales, and the company will announce September sales on Wednesday. Reporters were given a look rare look inside the high-tech world of nano chip production last week during a visit to a TSMC foundry in southern Taiwan. For security reasons, no photographs or video were allowed. Standing on a site that was a sugar cane field about two decades ago, the fab is the world’s largest logic chip factory and produces 40- and 65-nm chips for low-end smartphones and tablets. In a dimly lit, climate-controlled room, masked engineers dressed in ‘bunny suits’ work with robots assembling wafers. Machines currently outnumber workers 20 to one. By the end of the year, the company envisages that will spread to 75 to one. Before entering the fab, the jumpsuited visitors pass through a “dust-blowing” corridor. “The suits are for protecting the wafer, not you,” TSMC spokesman said ahead of the tour. “Even a single hair or a sneeze will damage our wafer.” Nearby, TSMC’s latest fab will mainly produce 20-nm chips and 3-dimensional 16-nm FinFET chips. The Taiwanese company declined to give details of its new capacity, citing confidentiality reasons. Intel started 22-nm FinFET production two years ago and it will begin small production on 14-nm by the end of this year, while Samsung is expected to also start the same process from late next year. Intel dominates the PC industry, but has been slow to adapt its chips to be suitable for smartphones and tablets. Samsung, the world’s biggest memory chip maker, is renovating its Austin, Texas chip plant with $4 billion investment to boost production of mobile processor chips since last year. It is also building a new system chips plant in South Korea with 2.25 trillion won ($2.10 billion) investment. HSBC analyst Steven Pelayo, who is based in Hong Kong, says that as well outsmarting its rivals by planning large capacity expansion, the company is getting better margin on return. “We just have to acknowledge that the risk is increasing - trying to get the next step of technology out, it’s getting more and more difficult, and competitors are pretty well funded this time,” he said.",10082013,http://www.reuters.com/article/tsmc-microchips/fab-times-taiwans-tsmc-thinks-big-in-micro-chip-race-idUSL4N0HU1AW20131008
548,INTC,Intel talks up chips for growing wave of connected gadgets,"SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Intel Corp  talked up new chips on Tuesday aimed at medical equipment, automobile entertainment systems and other devices far from its shrinking core market of personal computers. Intel and other technology companies are betting that what they call the “Internet of Things” — a trend toward connecting everything from bathroom scales, to factory robots and skyscraper ventilation systems to the Internet - will create massive demand for new electronics and software over the next several years. Close to a dozen electronics manufacturers have started using Intel’s new Atom E3800 chip, a variant of Intel’s low-power mobile processors, Ton Steenman, general manager of Intel’s Intelligent Systems Group, told reporters at an event. “It will allow us to reach into a whole new set of applications and billions of devices we have never been able to delve into before,” Steenman said of the new chip. He said the Atom chips became available this quarter and offer features useful in industrial machines, like error correction and the ability to withstand high temperatures. A smaller, scaled down chip, part of Intel’s recently announced Quark line of very low-power components, is due to begin shipping in the first quarter of 2014. The world’s biggest chipmaker, Intel dominates the PC industry but it was slow to adapt its chips to be suitable for smartphones and tablets. The Santa Clara, California company is now scrambling to tap into new markets to help it keep its multi-billion dollar fabrication plants humming near full capacity and protect its enviable 63-percent gross margins. Steenman declined to say when he expects chips aimed at the Internet of Things to deliver meaningful sales for Intel, which had revenue of $53 billion last year. He also declined to say how much Intel would charge for the chips. Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, estimated that the Atom chips likely sell for between $20 and $50 each, while the Quark chips may be priced near $5 a piece. By comparison, Intel’s powerful, and highly profitable, Xeon chips for servers typically sell for hundreds or even thousands of dollars each.",10082013,http://www.reuters.com/article/intel-chips/intel-talks-up-chips-for-growing-wave-of-connected-gadgets-idUSL1N0HY1JZ20131008

550,INTC,"UPDATE 4-Intel reports mixed quarter, delays cutting-edge chip","(Adds CFO comment, details on chip delay) By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Intel Corp’s  third-quarter results modestly beat expectations on Tuesday, but its current-quarter revenue outlook fell short and it warned that production of its upcoming Broadwell processors was delayed. The world’s top chipmaker is betting that its current Haswell PC processor with improved battery life will boost sales for the rest of 2013, beyond the typically strong third quarter when PC manufacturers buy chips in anticipation of holiday demand. But preparations for the Broadwell chip, which will succeed Haswell, have fallen behind projections by about three months due to technical setbacks, Brian Krzanich told analysts on a conference call following Intel’s quarterly report on Tuesday. He said production of the Broadwell chips, based on the 14 nanometer technology that is ahead of rivals’ technology, will not begin until the first quarter. “We and our (manufacturing) partners have a strong desire to get Broadwell to the market,” Krzanich said. “This is a small blip in the schedule.” Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said the delay would not affect gross margins in the fourth quarter or impact the competitiveness of Intel’s product lineup. “We’re not happy with the one-quarter push but it does point to how difficult these problems are to solve,” he told Reuters. Much of Intel’s strength has historically come from its chip manufacturing technology, which is the most advanced in the world and is ahead of rivals by around two years. Broadwell’s delay should have little impact on Intel’s sales, said FBR analyst Chris Rolland, although he added that investors were sensitive to any hint of technology trouble at the chipmaker. “For these guys, their competitive advantage is based on manufacturing. It’s certainly a small setback. You don’t want to screw with timetables, and you don’t want to screw with Moore’s law,” Rolland said. With consumers increasingly favoring tablets and smartphones, Intel is wrestling with a slowdown in its core PC market while trying to make inroads in low-power mobile devices. Adapting to the slow PC industry, Intel also trimmed its 2013 capital expenditure target to $10.8 billion, plus or minus $300 million, from $11 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Since taking the helm in May, Krzanich has pushed to improve Intel’s offering of chips for mobile devices. It recently announced a lineup of ultra-small chips for wearable devices, which are growing more popular. Intel dominates the PC industry but it was slow to adapt its chips for low-power mobile gadgets like smartphones and tablets. Krzanich has promised Intel’s new Bay Trail mobile chip would find its way into a slew of tablets, but it is still unclear how much progress is being made and how much those mobile chips, which sell for less than Intel’s latest PC chips, may affect its gross margins. Some analysts believe the PC industry’s troubles are already baked into the price of Intel’s stock, which has risen about 14 percent in 2013, less than the Standard & Poor’s 500’s increase of 20 percent. Intel shares trade at 12 times expected earnings, only slightly less than rival Qualcomm Inc’s at 14 times earnings. The company said its gross margin in the third quarter was 62.4 percent, and it forecast 61 percent for the fourth quarter. Analysts had expected 60.92 percent for the third quarter and 60.98 percent for the fourth quarter. Intel posted net earnings of $2.95 billion, or 58 cents a share, compared to $2.97 billion, or 58 cents share, in the year-ago quarter. Analysts had expected earnings per share of 53 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue was $13.48 billion, barely changed from $13.46 billion in the year-ago quarter. Intel forecast revenue of $13.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million for the current fourth quarter. Analysts had expected $13.463 billion in revenue for the third quarter and $14.004 billion for the fourth quarter. Shares of Intel were down 2.31 percent in extended trade after closing down 0.26 percent at $23.39 on Nasdaq.

After the market closed, futures indicated continued pressure after Fitch Ratings placed the United States’ ‘AAA’ rating on rating watch negative, citing the debt ceiling gridlock. “Although Fitch continues to believe that the debt ceiling will be raised soon, the political brinkmanship and reduced financing flexibility could increase the risk of a U.S. default,” the rating agency wrote in a statement. The move echoed a similar action by Standard & Poor’s in August 2011, when the agency downgraded the U.S. credit rating because of political gridlock related to the debt ceiling. Futures fell, with S&P; 500 futures down 10.7 points, Dow Jones industrial average futures off 122 points and Nasdaq 100 futures down 7.5 points. “The last time this sort of thing happened, the practical effect on markets wasn’t significant. But this time, I don’t know what the impact could be,” said John Carey, portfolio manager at Pioneer Investment Management in Boston, which has about $200 billion in assets under management. “At some point this will really start to matter, and if nothing else, it highlights the concern people have about the budgetary situation. It lets investors know that this kind of risk is on the horizon.” During Tuesday’s session, traders held off making big bets given the political uncertainty, which overshadowed some key corporate earnings. Selling accelerated during the afternoon after Senator Richard Durbin said Senate negotiations had been suspended until House Speaker John Boehner can work out a fiscal plan that can proceed in the House of Representatives. Losses were broad, with all 10 S&P; 500 sectors falling on the day. Three-fourths of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange ended lower, while 68 percent of Nasdaq-listed shares fell. The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 133.25 points, or 0.87 percent, at 15,168.01. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was down 12.08 points, or 0.71 percent, at 1,698.06. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 21.26 points, or 0.56 percent, at 3,794.01. Despite the day’s decline, the S&P; remains above its key moving averages, which have been serving as support. The index is currently about 0.6 percent above its 14-day moving average. Lawmakers have until Oct. 17 to agree to extend the $16.7 trillion U.S. borrowing limit or the country will risk an unprecedented debt default. The White House and Senate rejected the House’s latest offer, while Republican leaders also failed to get support for the plan from rank and file members within their party. Markets have largely avoided steep losses on optimism that lawmakers would agree to end the partial government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling. At the same time, volatility has spiked as the deadline approaches with little obvious progress. The CBOE Volatility index jumped 16 percent and is up more than 40 percent over the past four weeks. “The odds that there won’t be a deal over the next month are near zero, but there is some chance we won’t see something by the 17th. If that happens ... we could easily correct 3-5 percent,” said Jim McDonald, who helps oversee $803 billion as chief investment strategist at Chicago-based Northern Trust Global Investments. “While the market has climbed over the past two weeks,” he added, “that would reverse if there was any real concern” about missing the deadline. Among other assets, crude oil fell 1.5 percent, while gold, which is viewed as a safe haven, rose 0.7 percent. The situation in Washington has driven trading lately, overshadowing the beginning of a busy week of earnings. Citigroup Inc reported weaker-than-expected results as the bank was hit by a double-digit drop in bond trading revenue for the quarter, sending its shares down 1.5 percent to $48.86. Johnson & Johnson reported stronger-than-expected quarterly results on strong growth for its prescription drugs, while Coca-Cola Co reported revenue slightly under expectations.

Perlmutter, who was passed over by Intel’s board for the job of chief executive officer earlier this year, will leave in February to pursue other opportunities, the company said in a filing on Wednesday. As Executive Vice President and General Manager, Intel Architecture Group, Perlmutter was sidelined in May after Brian Krzanich was appointed chief executive and quickly reorganized the chipmaker’s main product groups. The PC client group, mobile communications and data center unit that previously reported to Perlmutter now answer directly to Krzanich, who previously ran Intel’s cutting-edge chip plants. Known affectionately within Intel and among friends as Dadi, Perlmutter joined the company in 1980 after graduating from the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology. A decade ago, he headed development of technology used in Intel’s Centrino platform, which led to the widespread adoption of Wifi technology that freed computer users from using cables to connect to the Internet. Before that, he led technology pushes that contributed to Intel’s Pentium processors. “A lot of the way people use their PCs today is due in no small part to the work Dadi did,” said Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy. During his career, Intel became a dominant chipmaker calling the shots in the PC industry. But in recent years, it has struggled to catch up with smaller rivals such as Qualcomm Inc as smartphones and tablets gained popularity. An Israeli based at the chipmaker’s Santa Clara, California headquarters, Perlmutter was also the company’s most senior Intel executive to be paid in Israeli shekels.

556,INTC,"Broadcom, other U.S. chipmakers, leave investors wanting more","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A host of U.S. chipmakers gave quarterly revenue forecasts that disappointed Wall Street and hurt their shares on Tuesday, including Broadcom Corp, which said it would lay off over a thousand workers as it struggles with slow demand for its cellphone chips. Broadcom, programmable chipmaker Altera Corp and radio frequency chipmaker RF Micro Devices Inc joined Intel Corp and Texas Instruments Inc on a growing list of semiconductor companies that have unveiled underwhelming quarterly forecasts over the past week. Broadcom’s stock dropped about 8 percent in extended trade, while Altera’s shares were down nearly 6 percent and RF Micro was down 5 percent. “You’re seeing it across the whole semiconductor ecosystem. We haven’t had a good revenue number outside of memory (chips),” said RBC analyst Doug Freedman, referring to memory chipmaker maker Micron Technology Inc, which posted fiscal fourth-quarter revenue above expectations this month. While the world economy remains soft, buyers see little reason to put in new orders to build up inventories of chips for use in cars, industrial equipment, laptops and smartphones, Freedman said. Altera expects flat sales of its chips for wireless, military, auto and industrial customers in the current quarter, executives said on a conference call with analysts. STMicroelectronics NV, Europe’s largest maker of semiconductors, said that in the September quarter it saw soft demand for chips used in high-end smartphones in Asia and it predicted little or no revenue growth in the December quarter. RF Micro also forecast current-quarter revenue below market expectations, saying it expects revenue from its wireless infrastructure business, including Wi-Fi connectivity, to decline. Struggling with soft demand for its connectivity chips, Broadcom said that during the third quarter it started a restructuring plan to reduce expenses, including cutting its workforce by up to 1,150 employees. Broadcom employs around 12,050 people. Worries about Broadcom’s slow progress launching 4G chips for faster wireless communication as well as concerns about growing competition selling connectivity chips used in smartphones have hurt that company’s stock, which has fallen 19 percent in 2013. Related to its cost-saving plan, Broadcom recorded a $12 million restructuring cost in the third quarter and will record another for $20 million in the current quarter. A number of analysts on Broadcom’s quarterly conference call expressed concerns about its lack of progress launching baseband chips with LTE, or Long Term Evolution, a technology allowing fast data transfer rates in smartphones that has become widely adopted in the United States. “You’ll see the deployment of our LTE solutions which we’ve been working on for a long time here and really trying to make that come to pass,” Chief Executive Officer Scott McGregor told analysts. He said LTE would be available in early 2014. Broadcom said it is also experiencing soft demand for its connectivity chips, used in mobile devices to handle Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and GPS. Like larger Intel, Broadcom has faced setbacks launching chips featuring multimode, carrier-validated LTE, a technology dominated almost completely by Qualcomm Inc. Broadcom sells lower-end 3G baseband chips but many smartphone makers are moving up to 4G and competition is increasing. “The competitive pricing environment on 3G is fairly ferocious,” McGregor said. “People are pricing aggressively to win share there.” Last month, Broadcom said it was buying Japanese chipmaker Renesas Electronics’ LTE-related assets for $164 million to speed up its launch of next-generation Long Term Evolution communications technology. Some of Broadcom’s announced layoffs relate to that acquisition. On Monday, Texas Instruments’ unexpectedly low fourth-quarter revenue called into question the strength of a recent recovery in chips for automobiles and industrial machines. Intel, struggling with falling PC sales, last week forecast revenue for the December quarter that disappointed investors looking for more strength from the top chipmaker’s newest processors. Broadcom said revenue in the fourth quarter would dip to $1.975 billion, plus or minus 3 percent. Analysts, on average have forecast fourth-quarter revenue of $2.135 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The Irvine, California-based chipmaker posted third-quarter revenue of $2.146 billion, compared with $2.085 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts, on average, expected third-quarter revenue of $2.128 billion. Third-quarter net profit rose to $316 million, or 55 cents a share, versus $220 million, or 38 cents last year. Non-GAAP earnings per share were 76 cents, compared with analysts’ estimates for 69 cents a share.

561,INTC,RPT-Intel creates new business division for connected gadgets,"By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Intel Corp has set up a business division aimed at making money out of a new technology wave that can link up a host of electronic devices. The Santa Clara, California chipmaker and other technology companies are betting that what they call the ‘Internet of Things’ - a trend toward connecting everything from bathroom scales to skyscraper ventilation systems via the Internet - will create massive demand for new electronics and software. As Intel strives to make sure it’s not caught off-guard by future technology trends, its new ‘Internet of Things Solutions Group’ will report directly to Chief Executive Brian Krzanich, according to Doug Davis, the group’s general manager. “Krzanich is saying, ‘I want a higher level of focus on this to help us grow it and put the level of attention on it that it deserves,’” Davis told Reuters on Tuesday. The world’s biggest chipmaker, Intel dominates the personal computer industry but was slow to adapt its chips to be suitable for smartphones and tablets. A three-decade Intel manufacturing veteran who took over as CEO in May, Krzanich has made developing mobile chips a higher priority within Intel. In September, Krzanich announced that Intel was working on a new line of ultra-small and ultra-low-power microchips for wearable devices like smartwatches and bracelets, along with an ingestible version for biomedical uses. The new solutions group combines an existing Intel business focused on chips for commercial and industrial devices with Intel’s Wind River subsidiary, which sells software for commercial and industrial devices. “We’re pulling together a couple of pieces that are already doing well and we want to accelerate those efforts.

564,INTC,STOCK NEWS US-Traders eye later term Intel call options,"Real-time equity news [E U] U.S. stock market report   1452 ET 12Nov2013 Traders eye later term Intel call options  ———————————————————————————————————————-      Some players on Intel Corp appear to be shedding near-term calls and initiating new positions in longer-term options for upside exposure. The stock is up 25 cents to $24.41 on Tuesday afternoon and in the options market, an investor sold 43,700 November $25 strike Intel calls at 3 cents per contract in what is probably a closing trade before expiration, said WhatsTrading.com options strategist Frederic Ruffy. In the November $25 calls, volume was 47,644 contracts traded thus far against 67,054 lots in open interest, according to Trade Alert. Separately, but possibly related to the activity in the November $25 strike calls, an investor bought 17,000 December $25 calls on the chipmaker for 28 cents per contract. The December $25 call traded 55,330 times against 80,116 lots in open interest. The January $25, February $24 and December $24 calls on the stock are also seeing interest, as some players are possibly closing out November $25 calls, but seeking to maintain upside exposure by opening positions in later terms, Ruffy said. The stock, which has seen several months of seesaw action, is at the same levels on Tuesday as six months ago, he added. Reuters Messaging: doris.frankel.reuters.com@reuters.net  1414 ET 12Nov2013 Bearish action is seen in Facebook options ———————————————————————————————————————-  Shares in Facebook Inc rose 0.58 percent to $46.47 on Tuesday afternoon. But options activity on the stock this morning suggests some traders are positioning for the price of the underlying shares to continue lower in the near term, said Interactive Brokers Group equity options analyst Caitlin Duffy in a posting on the firm’s website on Tuesday. The stock is down approximately 14 percent since reaching an all-time high of $54.83 on Oct. 18. Big prints in the weekly $45 strike put options, expiring on Nov. 29,  caught Duffy’s attention, as more than 13,700 contracts traded thus far in the strike versus open interest of 4,261 contracts. It appears like most of the puts were purchased near the open at a premium of 94 cents each, she said. Owners of these $45 puts stand ready to profit at expiration in a couple of weeks in the event that Facebook shares trade below the breakeven point at $44.06. Overall options volume on FB is relatively light, with roughly 225,000 contracts in play thus far below the combined recent daily average of 577,000 contracts, Trade Alert figures showed. Calls are more active than puts with the call-to-put ratio hovering near 1.38. Reuters Messaging: doris.frankel.reuters.com@reuters.net   1337 ET 12Nov2013 Calls on JetBlue fly on broad strength in the airline sector  ———————————————————————————————————————- Call options on JetBlue Airways Corp are flying and the stock rose 4.29 percent to $8.02 on broad strength in the airline sector after the U.S. reached an antitrust settlement on the US Airways-American Airlines case. US Airways Group Inc and American Airlines have agreed to give up landing spots and gates at several U.S. airports to win U.S. antitrust approval for their proposed merger, the Department of Justice said on Tuesday.  AMR Corp is the parent of bankrupt American Airlines. In options trading, a sweep of 5,578 November $8 strike calls traded on JetBlue at Tuesday mid-morning for 20 cents and then 22 minutes later, another 2,576 contracts for 24 cents, followed by another 5,000 for 30 cents, said WhatsTrading.com options strategist Frederic Ruffy. In all, the November $8 strike call traded 20,811 times thus far against 7,460 contracts in open interest, Trade Alert data showed. The December $7, December $8 and March $8 strike calls are active as well in JetBlue. Overall volume on JBLU is 12 times greater than usual levels with 43,000 calls and 2,394 puts traded as of 1:36 p.m. EST, according to Trade Alert. Reuters Messaging: doris.frankel.reuters.com@reuters.net 1114 ET 12Nov2013 Volatility ETN VXX draws large long-term put purchase  ———————————————————————————————————————-      A large put buyer on the iPath S&P; 500 VIX Short-Term Futures exchange-traded note appears to be speculating that the fund’s shares will be pared by more than half by early 2016. Shares of VXX, which recently saw a reverse split, are down 21 cents to $48.31 after hitting a new intraday low of $48.14 early on Tuesday. In the options market, one player bought 63,000 January 2016 $20 puts on the ETN for $3.75 per contract, said WhatsTrading.com options strategist Frederic Ruffy. The hefty premium purchase is probably a play on the longer-term downtrend in shares, which are affected by changes in S&P; 500 implied volatility and backwardation/contango in the VIX futures market, he added. The ETN is based on the two front-month VIX futures, which typically carry a premium to the CBOE Volatility Index or VIX. Reuters Messaging: doris.frankel.reuters.com@reuters.net 1036 ET 12Nov2013 Strategists highlight key options trades this week  ———————————————————————————————————————-      Option order flow was muted on Monday, but there was interest to roll out protection from November to year-end in the emerging markets space, strategists said on Tuesday. About 640,000 puts traded in the iShares MSCI Emerging Market Fund on Monday versus 156,000 calls, according to Trade Alert. Shares of the exchange-traded fund closed at $40.95. One hefty put spread drove the higher volumes, as an investor was apparently selling 210,950 November $42.50 strike puts on the EEM for $1.60 and buying 250,000 December $41.5 puts for $1.55 per contract, said WhatsTrading.com options strategist Frederic Ruffy. Looking at open interest and trade history, the activity in the November $42.50 puts appears to be closing a position initiated a few weeks ago when EEM was trading around $42.55. A new position was opened in the December $41.5 puts. The position adjustment appears to be expressing concerns about additional losses for emerging markets over the next six weeks, Ruffy said. “These sorts of flows typically result in a steeping of EEM skew as put buyers overmatch those in demand for calls,” Credit Suisse derivative strategists said in a report on Tuesday. Of note was another print for the ETF on Monday where an investor bet against EEM skew by selling 30,000 December $38 puts to buy 30,000 December $44 calls and collecting 20 cents for the package, CS said. In equity options, Microsoft Corp continues to attract heavy call volume as investors digest expected management changes, said Dan Nathan, co-founder and editor of RiskReversal.com in a report late on Monday. A trader on Monday appeared to be taking profits by selling the January $33-$36 call spread, 20,000 times at $2.50 to close a position. In addition, he said there appeared to be a trader rolling up and out a bullish bet by selling 7,100 November $35 strike calls at $2.56 to close a position and bought February $40 strike calls for 74 cents to initiate a new position. Chinese Internet company SINA Corp reports earnings after the market’s close on Tuesday and the options market is implying about a 10 percent move for shares, up or down, Nathan said. The shares have realized an average move of about 6 percent over the past four quarters. With the stock down 15 percent in the last few weeks since making new two-year highs in mid October, a trader closed a bullish bet by selling the December $90-$110 call spread at $1.12, he said. Nathan noted that is appears like an odd sale considering it is a $20 wide call spread with an upcoming event and over a month to expiration in a stock that has the potential to make large moves with or without news. Facebook stock on Monday logged its third straight close below its 50-day moving average and is approaching key near term technical support at $45, Nathan said. A trader on Monday closed a now seemingly ambitious bullish bet by selling 12,500 December $60 calls at 19 cents, he added. Call activity outweighed puts in the stock on Monday by nearly two to one with a total of 287,000 calls to 150,000 puts, Trade Alert figures showed. The most active line was the December $50 calls with almost 25,000 contracts traded, Nathan said.

565,INTC,"Insight: For Intel, Hollywood dreams prove a leap too far","(Reuters) - Earlier this year, Intel Corp rented temporary retail space in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago for a splashy launch of Intel TV, a new Internet entertainment service that the chipmaker promised could revolutionize the television industry. But when customers walk into those stores this holiday season, they will not find any set-top TV boxes or programming services for sale. Instead, they will see ultra thin laptops and new tablets from a variety of vendors that Intel hopes will help boost its massive but flagging computer chip business. The drastic change in plans for the retail spaces follows the company’s abrupt abandonment of a grand plan to become an entertainment hub in living rooms around the world - a retreat that has been rumored but not yet acknowledged by the company. The project faced daunting challenges from the start, and Intel’s new CEO, Brian Krzanich, ultimately decided the company could not afford the distraction and expense, sources familiar with the decision told Reuters. At his first annual investor day on Thursday, Krzanich is expected to discuss the growing use of chips in everyday devices, plans to breath new life into PCs, and Intel’s growing contract manufacturing business - but not Intel TV. Sources close to the project confirmed media reports that Intel Corp is looking to sell the TV technology, called OnCue, with Verizon Communications Inc emerging as the most likely buyer. An Intel spokesman declined to comment. Intel’s retreat is a disappointment not only to former British Broadcasting Corp executive Erik Huggers, who led the project, but also to others in Silicon Valley who saw it as part of a wave of next-generation digital television products that might help break open a market tightly controlled by a handful of cable companies and entertainment conglomerates. Technology heavyweights including Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc Google Inc Sony Corp and Microsoft Corp all have similar ambitions. Yet thus far only Netflix Inc has proven to be a major disruption to the lucrative relationship between pay TV operators and the entertainment companies that provide them with content. Intel, a storied semiconductor company that has struggled to manage the transition from traditional personal computers to mobile devices, was always an unlikely player in the digital television wars. Its traditional strengths are in chip design and manufacturing, and it has little experience selling consumer products, much less television programming. But Paul Otellini, Intel’s CEO from 2005 until May of this year, saw an opportunity for Intel to diversify into a new consumer business, one centered on a high-tech set-top box and a slick user interface. The often-clunky hardware and software provided by cable companies, and the highly controlled structure of cable packages, seemed to beg for a better solution. Otellini entrusted the project to Huggers, a veteran TV executive who all but boasted that he knew nothing about chips. Huggers, who had originally pitched the idea, developed a business plan, and soon set up his group in offices with the flashy look of a media startup on the chipmaker’s Santa Clara, California, campus. Making his case for Intel TV to the public for the first time in February 2013 at a conference near Los Angeles, Huggers assured the audience that Intel would not offer channels a la carte, an industry buzz word despised by entertainment companies that count on “bundling” lower rated channels with popular ones. But Huggers also said Intel would offer channel packages that “are bundled right,” which many in Hollywood took to mean an attempt to slice off the less popular channels - something that would not come cheaply or easily. While Intel never said how much it planned to charge for its TV service, Huggers billed it as a premium product, rather than a cut-rate option for consumers hoping to save money by canceling their cable subscriptions. Huggers ultimately made only modest progress negotiating slimmer packages of channels, people familiar with the talks said. Still, by this summer, Huggers had more than 300 employees and was testing the OnCue device in the homes of thousands of Intel employees. Many people who saw a prototype of the device, a nondescript black box, and toyed with the all-important graphical interface software, described OnCue as far superior to what is generally offered by cable and satellite TV companies. Representatives for Verizon, Viacom Inc, NBC, CBS, Fox, Time Warner Inc and Disney’s ABC all declined to comment on their discussions with Intel. Krzanich, a manufacturing expert who won the top job after the Intel board decided to stick with an in-house executive, never shared Otellini’s interest in Intel TV. Meeting with a group of reporters a month into his tenure as CEO, he spoke for an hour about his mobile chip strategy. When pressed about the TV business he struck a surprisingly cautious tone, saying the company is not expert at content. Intel’s TV project was a distraction to Krzanich, company sources say. He spent his first six months as CEO focused on two threats to the chipmaker’s core business - a declining PC industry and a lack of progress in smartphones and tablets. “It’s not wrong for them to look for growth wherever they can find it because they need to,” said Bernstein semiconductor analyst Stacy Rasgon. “But (Krzanich) has enough on his plate to worry about.” While Huggers came close to finalizing deals with some of the major programmers, according to industry sources on both sides of the talks, the terms were such that Intel would have faced upfront outlays in the hundreds of millions regardless of how quickly the service caught on, the same sources say. “The problem is Intel’s appetite for the size of the financial risk required to launch,” said Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG, noting the big commitments to media companies as well as large consumer marketing and customer service operations. He pegged launch costs in the hundreds of millions of dollars but declined to be more specific. Intel also had to make concessions to media companies that might have made it harder to sell the service: Viewers streaming previously aired shows from some networks would not be allowed to fast-forward through commercials, for example. Still, Intel TV would have offered far easier navigation, simple access to archived programming, and innovations in advertising delivery and personalized services. It would have also held out the potential for other features that could be readily implemented with an advanced Intel-powered set-top box and associated Internet-based services. Ultimately, Krzanich was not willing to make the bet. Media company sources say tentative deals with Intel are now on hold as the chip company seeks a buyer for the service. Huggers hopes to sell the television project as turnkey operation, including its technology and engineers, and would like to see the service launch under a more media-oriented company, some of the industry sources say. For Intel, it has been a tough lesson in reinvention. Krzanich “is a bit more of a realist than Paul was,” Bernstein’s Rasgon said, referring to Otellini. “They really believed they could differentiate on the hardware,” he said. “What they didn’t understand when they started, because it is new, is it’s about the content - not about the hardware.” ",11202013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-intel-tv-insight/insight-for-intel-hollywood-dreams-prove-a-leap-too-far-idUSBRE9AJ17620131120

568,INTC,Intel CEO says contract manufacturing business to expand,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said on Thursday he would expand his company’s small contract manufacturing business, paving the way for more chipmakers to tap into the world’s most advanced process technology. With Intel far behind rivals in making chips for smartphones and tablets, many on Wall Street have urged the company to expand its contract manufacturing business, which currently contributes little to its overall revenue, and to open its factories to high-volume clients making mobile processors. “We’re going to go much further. If we can utilize our silicon to provide the best computing, we’ll do that,” Krzanich told analysts. “People who can use our leading edge and build computing capabilities that are better than anyone else’s, those are good candidates for our foundry service.” Intel shares jumped more than 2.5 percent by the end of trading on Thursday. At his first annual investor day since taking over as chief executive in May, Krzanich said the slumping personal computer industry, Intel’s core market, was showing signs of bottoming out. “Our view is that it’s declining but it’s beginning to show signs of stabilization,” he said. Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said global PC shipments are likely to decline slightly next year as consumers in emerging markets favor tablets. Intel’s revenues next year will be flat, with lower PC sales offsetting more server sales, he said. Krzanich said that during his six-month tenure as CEO, Intel improved its chip offerings for tablet makers. He pledged to quadruple the number of tablets with Intel chips in 2014. Tablets with Intel chips would range in price from less than $100 to more than $400, he said, adding he recently gave every Intel board member a $149 Android tablet made with an Intel chip to demonstrate the progress the company was making in mobile. Intel is the world’s top chipmaker but it has been slow to adapt its processors for smartphones and tablets, markets now dominated by rivals like Qualcomm and Samsung Electronics. Intel shareholders and its board are betting that Krzanich, a veteran from Intel’s cutting-edge manufacturing operation who replaced retiring CEO Paul Otellini, will be able to steer the company back on track. “When we began our search for the CEO a year ago ... I was embarrassed that we had lost our way,” Intel Chairman Andy Bryant said at the event. Intel also unveiled two upcoming mobile chips from its Atom line designed to easily interchange features to create different versions of the component. A high-end version of the new chip, code named Broxton, and is due out in mid-2015. Krzanich pointed to SoFIA, a low-end version, as an example of Intel’s new pragmatism and willingness to change how it does business. He said that in the interest of speed, SoFIA would initially be manufactured outside of Intel, with the goal of bringing it to market next year. Intel will later move production of SoFIA chips to its own cutting-edge 14 nanometer manufacturing lines, Krzanich said. Manufacturing chips on behalf of other companies is a major departure for Intel, which for decades had based its business on using its factory prowess to offer its own PC chips that were superior to rival products. As PC sales shrink, Krzanich sees an opportunity to fill idle production lines while earning new revenue. Thursday’s announcement shows he is much more willing than his predecessor, Otellini, to open Intel’s factories to a wide range of companies, including potential competitors. “Wow,” Raymond James analyst Hans Mosesmann wrote in a note to clients. “It’s very refreshing to see Intel make this move and could have important implications for the industry.” Intel could end up acting as manufacturing components on behalf of rivals like graphics chipmaker Nvidia or even dominant mobile chipmaker Qualcomm, Mosesmann wrote. Those companies currently rely on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, or TSMC, the leading contract chip manufacturer, known in the industry as a foundry. “In foundry, we’re extending our capabilities and we’re open for business.” said Intel President Renee James, even with competitors, she added. Otellini agreed early this year for Intel to manufacture programmable chips on behalf of Altera, a Silicon Valley neighbor it does not compete with. That deal, seen as allowing Intel to eventually take on larger customers, spurred speculation that Intel could do a much bigger deal to make iPhone or iPad chips for Apple, which currently depends on Samsung to manufacture its chips. Responding to consumer preferences, Intel plans to drastically increase its investment in chips for the fast-growing tablet market while trimming investments in the company’s core PC processor business, Smith said.

Huggers, who had originally pitched the idea, developed a business plan, and soon set up his group in offices with the flashy look of a media startup on the chipmaker’s Santa Clara, California, campus. Making his case for Intel TV to the public for the first time in February 2013 at a conference near Los Angeles, Huggers assured the audience that Intel would not offer channels a la carte, an industry buzz word despised by entertainment companies that count on “bundling” lower rated channels with popular ones. But Huggers also said Intel would offer channel packages that “are bundled right,” which many in Hollywood took to mean an attempt to slice off the less popular channels - something that would not come cheaply or easily. While Intel never said how much it planned to charge for its TV service, Huggers billed it as a premium product, rather than a cut-rate option for consumers hoping to save money by canceling their cable subscriptions. Huggers ultimately made only modest progress negotiating slimmer packages of channels, people familiar with the talks said. Still, by this summer, Huggers had more than 300 employees and was testing the OnCue device in the homes of thousands of Intel employees. Many people who saw a prototype of the device, a nondescript black box, and toyed with the all-important graphical interface software, described OnCue as far superior to what is generally offered by cable and satellite TV companies. Representatives for Verizon, Viacom Inc, NBC, CBS, Fox, Time Warner Inc and Disney’s ABC all declined to comment on their discussions with Intel. Krzanich, a manufacturing expert who won the top job after the Intel board decided to stick with an in-house executive, never shared Otellini’s interest in Intel TV. Meeting with a group of reporters a month into his tenure as CEO, he spoke for an hour about his mobile chip strategy. When pressed about the TV business he struck a surprisingly cautious tone, saying the company is not expert at content. Intel’s TV project was a distraction to Krzanich, company sources say. He spent his first six months as CEO focused on two threats to the chipmaker’s core business - a declining PC industry and a lack of progress in smartphones and tablets. “It’s not wrong for them to look for growth wherever they can find it because they need to,” said Bernstein semiconductor analyst Stacy Rasgon. “But (Krzanich) has enough on his plate to worry about.” While Huggers came close to finalizing deals with some of the major programmers, according to industry sources on both sides of the talks, the terms were such that Intel would have faced upfront outlays in the hundreds of millions regardless of how quickly the service caught on, the same sources say. “The problem is Intel’s appetite for the size of the financial risk required to launch,” said Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG, noting the big commitments to media companies as well as large consumer marketing and customer service operations. He pegged launch costs in the hundreds of millions of dollars but declined to be more specific. Intel also had to make concessions to media companies that might have made it harder to sell the service: Viewers streaming previously aired shows from some networks would not be allowed to fast-forward through commercials, for example. Still, Intel TV would have offered far easier navigation, simple access to archived programming, and innovations in advertising delivery and personalized services. It would have also held out the potential for other features that could be readily implemented with an advanced Intel-powered set-top box and associated Internet-based services. Ultimately, Krzanich was not willing to make the bet. Media company sources say tentative deals with Intel are now on hold as the chip company seeks a buyer for the service. Huggers hopes to sell the television project as turnkey operation, including its technology and engineers, and would like to see the service launch under a more media-oriented company, some of the industry sources say. For Intel, it has been a tough lesson in reinvention. Krzanich “is a bit more of a realist than Paul was,” Bernstein’s Rasgon said, referring to Otellini. “They really believed they could differentiate on the hardware,” he said. “What they didn’t understand when they started, because it is new, is it’s about the content - not about the hardware.” ",11212013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-intel-tv/insight-for-intel-hollywood-dreams-prove-a-leap-too-far-idUSBRE9AK06020131121
573,INTC,"INSIGHT-For Intel, Hollywood dreams prove a leap too far","(Adds detail on Verizon media report in sixth paragraph) By Noel Randewich, Ronald Grover  and Liana B. Baker Nov 20 (Reuters) - Earlier this year, Intel Corp rented temporary retail space in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago for a splashy launch of Intel TV, a new Internet entertainment service that the chipmaker promised could revolutionize the television industry. But when customers walk into those stores this holiday season, they will not find any set-top TV boxes or programming services for sale. Instead, they will see ultra thin laptops and new tablets from a variety of vendors that Intel hopes will help boost its massive but flagging computer chip business. The drastic change in plans for the retail spaces follows the company’s abrupt abandonment of a grand plan to become an entertainment hub in living rooms around the world - a retreat that has been rumored but not yet acknowledged by the company. The project faced daunting challenges from the start, and Intel’s new CEO, Brian Krzanich, ultimately decided the company could not afford the distraction and expense, sources familiar with the decision told Reuters. At his first annual investor day on Thursday, Krzanich is expected to discuss the growing use of chips in everyday devices, plans to breath new life into PCs, and Intel’s growing contract manufacturing business - but not Intel TV. Sources close to the project said Intel Corp is looking to sell the TV technology, called OnCue, with Verizon Communications Inc emerging as the most likely buyer, as first reported by the AllThingsD website. An Intel spokesman declined to comment. Intel’s retreat is a disappointment not only to former British Broadcasting Corp executive Erik Huggers, who led the project, but also to others in Silicon Valley who saw it as part of a wave of next-generation digital television products that might help break open a market tightly controlled by a handful of cable companies and entertainment conglomerates. Technology heavyweights including Apple Inc,  Amazon.com Inc  Google Inc Sony Corp  and Microsoft Corp all have similar ambitions. Yet thus far only Netflix Inc has proven to be a major disruption to the lucrative relationship between pay TV operators and the entertainment companies that provide them with content. Intel, a storied semiconductor company that has struggled to manage the transition from traditional personal computers to mobile devices, was always an unlikely player in the digital television wars. Its traditional strengths are in chip design and manufacturing, and it has little experience selling consumer products, much less television programming. But Paul Otellini, Intel’s CEO from 2005 until May of this year, saw an opportunity for Intel to diversify into a new consumer business, one centered on a high-tech set-top box and a slick user interface. The often-clunky hardware and software provided by cable companies, and the highly controlled structure of cable packages, seemed to beg for a better solution. Otellini entrusted the project to Huggers, a veteran TV executive who all but boasted that he knew nothing about chips. Huggers, who had originally pitched the idea, developed a business plan, and soon set up his group in offices with the flashy look of a media startup on the chipmaker’s Santa Clara, California, campus. Making his case for Intel TV to the public for the first time in Feburary 2013 at a conference near Los Angeles, Huggers assured the audience that Intel would not offer channels a la carte, an industry buzz word despised by entertainment companies that count on “bundling” lower rated channels with popular ones.

575,INTC,Intel shares drop as Wall Street questions mobile growth,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of Intel Corp fell nearly 5 percent on Friday after Wall Street came away from its investor meeting craving more evidence that the chipmaker can forge a strong mobile presence to drive up revenue and margins. Investors wanted the company at the vanguard of personal-computer technology to lay out a plan to get higher-margin chips into tablets and smartphones, which are rapidly eroding sales of traditional PCs. Executives on Thursday acknowledged that they had underestimated the impact of the mobile revolution, and Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich outlined plans to begin manufacturing semiconductors for other companies and develop microchips for cheaper tablets. But some analysts warn the latter was a margin-eroding move, arguing Intel still had no technology to dominate next-generation smartphones that run on 4G LTE standards. “There was a lack of real, confidence-inspiring color on mobility,” said JMP Securities analyst Alex Gauna. “It is about bringing something different to the table in mobility that can sustain their gross margin structure. “That’s what we didn’t get from the analysts’ day, to really convince us that they’re going to get back to growth.” On Thursday, Intel projected flat revenue and gross margins for 2014 - slightly below market projections for about 2 percent growth in sales. While analysts said the new CEO may be setting a low bar, others saw that as highlighting an uncertain 2014 and the difficulty of expanding margins as the PC market continues to shrink. The “2014 guidance gave investors their first hints of the potholes in store on the journey,” Bernstein’s Stacy Rasgon wrote on Friday. “Intel is trying to buy their way into the tablet market at great near-term cost, and outlook for flat revenue, gross margins ... was disappointing.” Intel stock was down 4.8 percent at $24.02 at midday.

577,INTC,RPT-Fitch affirms Intel's ratings at 'A+'; outlook stable,"Nov 26 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Intel Corporation’s  (Intel) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at ‘A+’ with a Stable Outlook. The  short-term IDR was also affirmed at ‘F1’. Fitch views Intel as one of the strongest credits in the technology space driven  by its position as the leading provider of microprocessors for PCs and servers  worldwide. The company’s manufacturing technology advantage has resulted in a  widening degree of differentiation from its competitors over the years. While  new competition has emerged recently in ARM-based processors for tablets and  smartphones, Fitch believes that the company’s dominance of x86 based processors  which are the most prevalent computing platform in the world will result in a  relatively stable market opportunity for the foreseeable future. Recently, Intel announced two modest changes to its longer-term strategy,  reflecting the growing challenges in the PC and mobile computing markets. The  company plans to move more aggressively in developing and bringing to market  processors for the convertible notebook, tablet and smartphone markets. By 2015,  Intel expects these processors to effectively be at par with its leading edge  solutions for the traditional PC market utilizing its most advanced 14nm  manufacturing technology. The company expects to incur a greater loss in this  segment of its business in 2014 as it invests in this development. Fitch  believes that Intel has begun to demonstrate that it can compete in the mobile  market but that 2014 will be a key window for it to develop meaningful market  share leading into 2015. Expectations for relative stability in the PC Client  segment in 2014 and solid growth in the Data Center segment provide some measure  of flexibility for Intel to manage through these market challenges over the next  few years at the current rating. Intel also announced that it intends to open its foundry service offerings more  broadly, potentially putting the company in position to manufacture chips for  direct competitors in the smartphone and tablet markets. Fitch believes that  this potential shift in the business is a net neutral development for the  credit. On one hand this could provide meaningful diversification in this part  of the market for the company during a time when it is spending aggressively on  new manufacturing process technology development and capacity expansion. This  should lessen the risk of Intel’s ultimate level of success in the smartphone  and tablet markets to the credit. Conversely, a broader offering of its foundry  services could potentially negate Intel’s manufacturing process technology  leadership as a key competitive advantage in a segment of the market where it is  significantly behind competitors in terms of market share. Fitch expects Intel  will choose whether or not to partner with potential competitors based on the  relative economics of either strategy as it expands these services over the next  few years. The ratings and outlook recommendation reflect the following considerations: —Fitch expects the company to maintain a relatively conservative capital  structure and balanced approach to shareholder friendly actions. Fitch expects  leverage (total debt / EBITDA) to remain comfortably below 1x and for normalized  free cash flow to adjusted debt to range near 35% or above 50% before dividends. —Fitch expects share repurchases and the company’s dividend to be financed by  free cash flow. Fitch does expect Intel to continue to be acquisitive going  forward which could potentially be a source of additional modest debt financing. —Fitch believes that Intel’s new energy efficient processors targeted for  tablets and smartphones will begin to establish the company’s presence in that  market. Intel’s technology leadership in the semiconductor space is a  significant competitive advantage and its focus on this emerging market  opportunity should begin to produce returns over the next few years. Importantly, Fitch does not believe that Intel’s ultimate success in this market  is contingent on the success of Windows 8 or future Windows platforms. That said  greater consumer adoption of Windows 8 devices should materially aid Intel over  the next few years. The short-term rating reflects the significant liquidity resources Intel has on  balance sheet. The company had $4.9 billion of cash plus $14.3 billion in  short-term investments including marketable debt securities as of Sept. 30,  2013, to support its $3 billion commercial paper program. Intel has no revolving  credit facility. Intel’s ratings and outlook are supported by the following factors: —Intel is the dominant microprocessor vendor and maintains a clear and  significant technology advantage, particularly in manufacturing, over its  nearest competitors. —Broad geographic and business diversification. Although the majority of the  company’s revenue is derived from PC and server demand, these markets are driven  by different secular growth trends which Fitch expects to contribute to  longer-term stability. —Continued long-term secular growth in digitalization and computer adoption  worldwide as well as greater penetration of microprocessors in areas outside of  traditional computing. Credit concerns include: —Intel is exposed to the highly cyclical demand for semiconductors which is  typically exacerbated at the beginning of cyclical downturns due to channel  inventory contraction. —The business model has high fixed costs, principally in R&D;, in addition to  being highly capital intensive. Intel’s high profit margins largely compensate  for this risk although capital spending has in recent times ranged near 50% of  EBITDA. —Intel has significant customer concentration with its 2 largest customers  representing 19% and 15% of revenue in 2011. —Potential technology shifts that reduce demand for Intel’s x86 solutions in  its core PC and server markets. This includes the potential for broader adoption  of ARM-based processing solutions beyond the smartphone and tablet markets. Liquidity as of Sept. 30, 2013, was solid with cash of $4.9 billion and a $3  billion commercial paper program which had no outstanding balance. Intel also  had $6.5 billion of short-term investments, $7.8 billion in trading assets and  $6.5 billion of marketable securities. Free cash flow of $6 billion over the  latest 12 month period further supports liquidity. The company does not have a  revolving credit facility to support its commercial paper program but Fitch  views Intel’s strong liquidity as providing ample support for the program.  Total debt as of Sept. 30, 2013, was $13.5 billion consisting principally of:  $1.5 billion in 1.95% senior unsecured notes due October 2016, $3 billion in  1.35% senior unsecured notes due December 2017, $2 billion in 3.3% senior  unsecured notes due October 2021, $1.5 billion in 2.7% senior unsecured notes  due December 2022, $750 million in 4% senior unsecured notes due December 2032,  $1.6 billion principal value in 2.95% junior subordinated debentures due July  2035, $2 billion principal value in 3.25% junior subordinated debentures due  July 2039, $1.5 billion in 4.8% senior unsecured notes due October 2041, and  $924 million in 4.25% senior unsecured notes due December 2042. Intel also owes approximately $600 million to NVIDIA as part of a long-term  patent cross licensing agreement in 2011, payable over six years. This amount is  categorized under accrued liabilities. Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include: —If Intel is successful in solidifying its market position in the market for  smartphone and tablet processors while maintaining its high level of  profitability, it is possible the ratings could be positively impacted. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: —If Intel is not successful in expanding its market share in the tablet and  smartphone market while consumer PC demand is further cannibalized by tablet  adoption, it is possible the ratings could be negatively impacted, potentially  resulting in a one or two notch downgrade over the next few years. —At the current rating level, Fitch would expect total debt / EBITDA to remain  comfortably below 1x and for free cash flow before dividends to represent 50% of  adjusted debt under normal conditions. If that free cash flow figure were to  fall closer to 20%, a rating in the ‘BBB’ category could be more appropriate.  Fitch has affirmed the following ratings for Intel: —Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at ‘A+’; —Short-term IDR at ‘F1’; —$3 billion commercial paper program at ‘F1’; —Senior unsecured notes at ‘A+’; and —Junior subordinated notes at ‘A’. The Rating Outlook is Stable.",11262013,http://www.reuters.com/article/fitch-affirms-intels-ratings-at-a-outloo/rpt-fitch-affirms-intels-ratings-at-a-outlook-stable-idUSFit67801920131126

The S&P; 500 scored its best day in nearly a month, with all 10 S&P; sector indexes solidly higher in the broad rally. About two-thirds of the stocks traded on both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq ended in positive territory. Both the Dow and the S&P; 500 closed slightly lower for the week, snapping eight-week rallies. U.S. employers added 203,000 jobs to nonfarm payrolls in November, exceeding the forecast. The U.S. unemployment rate fell to a five-year low of 7 percent in November from 7.3 percent in October, the Labor Department said. Recent data has been mixed, with indicators for the labor market and consumer spending showing strength, while reports on the housing market and business spending show those areas are faltering. “The report shows a continuation of the recovery, which had been sidelined by the shutdown in D.C. That, coupled with a consumer who appears to be in recovery mode, is a big reason for the market to be positive,” said Kristina Hooper, head of portfolio strategies at Allianz Global Investors, in New York. Many market participants have expected the Fed to announce a cut in stimulus in March. The Fed has said it would slow its massive bond purchases when certain economic measures meet its targets, including a drop in the U.S. unemployment rate. “The report is good, but not so compelling that this automatically changes the tapering story,” said Hooper, who helps oversee $436 billion in assets. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 198.69 points, or 1.26 percent, to close at 16,020.20. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 20.06 points, or 1.12 percent, to finish at 1,805.09. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 29.36 points, or 0.73 percent, to end at 4,062.52. The S&P; 500 recorded its best day since Nov. 8, and the Dow’s gain was its largest since Oct. 16. After an eight-week run that pushed the S&P; 500 up nearly 7 percent, the benchmark index had dropped 1.2 percent over the past five sessions, its longest losing streak since late September. For the week, the Dow fell 0.4 percent, and the S&P; 500 dipped 0.04 percent, while the Nasdaq rose 0.07 percent. Intel ranked among the S&P; 500’s top gainers, rising 2.3 percent to $24.82 after Citigroup raised its rating on the chipmaker to “buy” from “neutral.” J.C. Penney shares fell 8.7 percent to $8.08 after the department store chain said it had received a letter of inquiry from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, seeking an explanation on the company’s financial position. The stock is down almost 60 percent for the year so far. Barnes & Noble also disclosed an SEC investigation, and its stock slid 12 percent to $14.43. Other data showed personal spending rose 0.3 percent in October, slightly higher than expected. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan’s preliminary reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment jumped to 82.5 for December from a final November reading of 75.1. About 4.85 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data.",12062013,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-usa-stocks/us-stocks-wall-st-jumps-on-jobs-dow-sp-end-lower-for-the-week-idUSL2N0JL1YQ20131206
581,INTC,Barcelona strike sponsorship deal with Intel,"BARCELONA (Reuters) - Barcelona have agreed a sponsorship deal with Intel under which the chipmaker’s logo will be printed on the inside of players’ shirts, the Spanish champions announced on Thursday. The idea behind the unusual positioning of the “Intel Inside” logo is that it will be revealed when a player lifts his shirt to celebrate scoring a goal, Barca officials told a news conference in the Catalan capital. Players including Lionel Messi, Neymar and Andres Iniesta would be under no obligation to display the logo, which will be added to the shirts for the first time in Saturday’s La Liga match at home to Villarreal, Manel Arroyo, a club director responsible for media and sponsorship, said. Arroyo declined to reveal how much the deal - which runs for four and a half years and includes an option for an extension - was worth, saying it was “confidential”. Spanish media and Forbes magazine, without identifying the source of their information, reported Intel would pay Barca $25 million. As part of their first foray into soccer sponsorship, Intel will also provide technology to players and coaching staff as well as the recruits at Barca’s academy, officials said. Deborah Conrad, Intel’s chief marketing officer, said the decision to partner with Barca had been taken after a search for suitable “passion points” that the company hoped to tap into to help connect them with consumers. Barca have one of the most active social media communities in sport as well as hundreds of millions of fans around the world, Conrad noted. “We did not want to put the players under any obligation to show the logo a specific number of times but we do know that such goal celebrations are a big part of the culture of the sport,” she told Reuters by telephone.

582,INTC,UPDATE 1-Soccer-Barcelona strike sponsorship deal with Intel,"* Chipmaker’s logo to be displayed inside players’ shirts * Intel name to be revealed during goal celebrations * Deal worth $25 million over 4 1/2 years, media say BARCELONA, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Barcelona have agreed a sponsorship deal with Intel under which the chipmaker’s logo will be printed on the inside of players’ shirts, the Spanish champions announced on Thursday. The idea behind the unusual positioning of the “Intel Inside” logo is that it will be revealed when a player lifts his shirt to celebrate scoring a goal, Barca officials told a news conference in the Catalan capital. Players including Lionel Messi, Neymar and Andres Iniesta would be under no obligation to display the logo, which will be added to the shirts for the first time in Saturday’s La Liga match at home to Villarreal, Manel Arroyo, a club director responsible for media and sponsorship, said. Arroyo declined to reveal how much the deal - which runs for four and a half years and includes an option for an extension - was worth, saying it was “confidential”. Spanish media and Forbes magazine, without identifying the source of their information, reported Intel would pay Barca $25 million. As part of their first foray into soccer sponsorship, Intel will also provide technology to players and coaching staff as well as the recruits at Barca’s academy, officials said. Deborah Conrad, Intel’s chief marketing officer, said the decision to partner with Barca had been taken after a search for suitable “passion points” that the company hoped to tap into to help connect them with consumers. Barca have one of the most active social media communities in sport as well as hundreds of millions of fans around the world, Conrad noted. “We did not want to put the players under any obligation to show the logo a specific number of times but we do know that such goal celebrations are a big part of the culture of the sport,” she told Reuters by telephone.

585,INTC,John McAfee: glad Intel dropping name from security software,"BOSTON (Reuters) - John McAfee, the flamboyant millionaire who founded a pioneering anti-virus software company that Intel Corp bought for $7.7 billion, says he is glad that the chipmaker plans to drop his name from its products. Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich announced the decision to abandon the McAfee name late on Monday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, saying the company plans to adopt the “Intel Security” brand. “I’ve been begging them to drop the brand or fix the product,” McAfee said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. He did not speculate on a reason for the move, which was not completely unexpected. Last June, McAfee appeared in a profanity-laced video attacking the quality of the software produced by the company, which he founded in the late 1980s. He said he frequently gets emails from customers who complain that it degrades the performance of their computers and is difficult to remove. Intel has repeatedly said the attacks on the quality of its software are “ludicrous” and without merit. Its chief technology officer, Michael Fey, said on Tuesday that the company was not concerned about the video, partly because customers knew that John McAfee had not worked for the company in some 20 years. “Everybody realized the man was trying to get a laugh or make a joke. It is far from something that most buyers took seriously,” he said. “We didn’t really feel much pressure.” Still, he said, it would be a relief to be able to ignore John McAfee’s antics once Intel stopped using his name. “As an employee I am happy to stop having to answer that,” Fey said. Questions about Intel’s plans for keeping the McAfee brand first surfaced in late 2012, when John McAfee, to much publicity, left the Central American nation of Belize after police sought to question him about the murder of a neighbor. He said he was framed for a murder he did not commit. John McAfee fled to the United States in December 2012 and is developing technology dubbed D-Central that he says will help keep Internet communications safe from government snooping. Then in his video attacking the software, the millionaire fires a gun into a computer. He was undressed and pawed by a group of young women. McAfee said he did it all to mock the media’s unfair portrayal of him as unhinged. “I am who I am. I’m sorry I live on the edge and enjoy life and don’t care what people think of me,” he said on Tuesday, when asked how he felt about Intel dumping his name. “I’m sorry that the software has my name.” ",1072014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ces-intel-mcafee/john-mcafee-glad-intel-dropping-name-from-security-software-idUSBREA060YM20140107

588,INTC,Intel shows off wearable gadgets as chipmaker expands beyond PCs,"LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Intel CEO Brian Krzanich showed off wearable computing devices on Monday including earbuds that monitor your heart rate and a smart headset as the world’s largest chipmaker tries to get back on track after missing out on smartphones. With PC sales falling and smartphone growth tapering off, Intel and other technology companies are betting that movement-sensing bracelets, biometric patches and other wearable electronic devices may catch on with consumers and become major markets. The evolving category is a major theme at this week’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, with several companies expected to unveil their own versions of intelligent and connected clothing. Intel dominates the PC industry, but it has been slow to adapt its processors for smartphones and tablets, markets now dominated by rivals like Qualcomm and Samsung Electronics. The company has struggled in past attempts to expand beyond the PC arena. A years-long project to provide consumer TV services was shelved last year with its technology put up for sale and the company’s mobile processors have barely made a dent in the global smartphone market even after major improvements to them. After replacing former CEO Paul Otellini in May, Krzanich, a chip manufacturing and operations guru, created a new division focused on identifying future technology trends and making sure Intel is not caught off-guard again. In his keynote presentation at the technology show, Krzanich introduced some of that group’s early results, including sample gadgets that Intel is promoting to consumer device manufacturers. “We’re looking at a broad ecosystem of wearables, not just the device or the silicon,” he said. The company unveiled a tiny computer built with Intel’s low-power Quark technology and packaged in an SD-card form factor aimed at making it easy for clothing and gadget makers to integrate the platform into wearable products. Luxury department store Barneys New York is collaborating with Intel to develop smart bracelets that look like they were created by a fashion designer and not by an engineer. At the event, Krzanich also showed off Intel’s take on stereo earbuds for exercise enthusiasts that - as well as playing music - measure the wearer’s heartbeat through their ears. While other companies have launched similar pulse-taking audiophones, Intel’s are powered through a microphone jack that connects to the user’s smartphone, instead of a separate power source. In addition, integrated software can automatically change the music being played in order to encourage the wearer to speed up or slow down their workout depending on their heart rate. Intel also showed off a Bluetooth earpiece and microphone that the chipmaker says improves the responsiveness of personal assistant smartphone software like Apple’s Siri. The gadget features always-on technology that makes it easier to ask questions of the device and also monitors the user’s environment in order to avoid interrupting. “The real key here is seamless, no buttons, always listening, but it still has that low-power capability,” Krzanich said. Krzanich also showed a smartwatch meant for kids with “geo-fencing” capabilities that alert parents if their children stray from established walking routes to and from home or school or don’t arrive on time.

590,INTC,Intel shelves cutting-edge Arizona chip factory,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O), hit by slumping personal computer sales, has put off opening a major chip factory that President Barack Obama once held up as an example of U.S. manufacturing potential. The “Fab 42” facility built in Chandler, Arizona, originally slated as a $5 billion project that in late 2013 would start producing Intel’s most advanced chips, will remain closed for the foreseeable future while other factories at the same site are upgraded, said Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy. Intel’s decision not to open the chip plant was first reported by the Arizona Republic on Tuesday. “The new construction is going to be left vacant for now and it will be targeted at future technologies,” Mulloy told Reuters. Despite not opening the new factory, or fab, Intel has exceeded a target to hire over 1,000 employees since construction started in 2011, Mulloy said. Intel received state tax benefits for hiring those people. Obama, while campaigning for re-election in 2012, made a stop at the factory’s construction site, where he called for government incentives to attract manufacturing lost to Asia in recent years back to the United States. Intel is the world’s top chipmaker but it was caught off guard by smartphones and tablets, a computing revolution that has cut into demand for PCs, the company’s core business. Global PC shipments fell 10 percent in 2013, the worst year since market research firm Gartner began tracking those products. “The newer fab has not been equipped with the capital equipment. It has heating and air conditioning but the actual tools, the expensive stuff, are not in there,” Mulloy said. Much of Intel’s strength has historically come from its chip manufacturing technology, which is the most advanced in the world and is ahead of rivals by around two years. Intel originally meant to install its most advanced manufacturing technology at the plant and make 14 nanometer microchips with transistors so tiny that over 100 million of them could fit on the head of a pin. Existing factories at the Chandler site using Intel’s previous generation of manufacturing, 22 nm, are being converted to also make chips at 14 nm and many of Intel’s new employees are working there, Mulloy said. “It boils down to better capital utilization,” Mulloy said. The Santa Clara, California-based company says it makes around two thirds of its microprocessors in the United States, with others produced in Ireland, Israel and China. It is currently expanding a plant in Oregon where engineers will work on a long-term plan to manufacture microchips on silicon wafers measuring 450 millimeters - about the size of a large pizza. The largest wafers currently used in the chip industry measure 300 mm across. Plans by Intel and big rivals like Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) to eventually expand to 450 mm will allow them to save manufacturing costs by squeezing more chips on each wafer. Intel, which on Thursday is due to report is fourth-quarter earnings, said in November it expects its revenue to be flat in 2014 compared to last year.

593,INTC,"US STOCKS-Wall St advances, boosted by data and earnings","* JPMorgan edges up after results, Wells Fargo lower * Retail sales rise more than expected in December * Intel rallies after upgrade, GameStop slumps on outlook * Indexes up: Dow 0.6 pct, S&P; 1 pct, Nasdaq 1.6 pct By Ryan Vlastelica NEW YORK, Jan 14 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday, erasing much of the previous session’s steep drop, as December retail sales rose more than expected and investors digested earnings from major financial firms. The S&P; 500 suffered its biggest daily decline since Nov. 7 on Monday as investors exercised caution amid a ream of negative corporate earnings outlooks that suggested the market may be vulnerable with indexes near record levels. Retail sales increased 0.7 percent in December, excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, a rise that was bigger than anticipated. It was the first major economic indicator since Friday’s payroll report, which was sharply under expectations. “The retail sales are painting a better economic backdrop than payrolls did, and investors are using recent weakness as an opportunity to buy,” said Mike Gibbs, co-head of the equity advisory group at Raymond James in Memphis, Tennessee. The S&P;’s forward price-to-earnings ratio is the highest in nearly seven years, another sign investors may be more selective as the U.S. Federal Reserve begins to slow its stimulus, which contributed to massive gains in 2013. Both JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co  posted earnings that beat expectations, though upside was limited with Wells near all-time highs and JPMorgan at its highest since 2000. JPMorgan gained 0.4 percent to $57.95 while Wells was up 0.3 percent at $45.70. The S&P; financial index  advanced 0.8 percent. “Financials are putting up strong numbers, and we should be able to put in a decent print this quarter, especially since expectations have been trending down,” said Gibbs, who helps oversee about $450 billion in assets. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 94.72 points, or 0.58 percent, at 16,352.66. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  was up 17.76 points, or 0.98 percent, at 1,836.96. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 63.88 points, or 1.55 percent, at 4,177.19. Intel Corp shares jumped 3.8 percent to $26.47, helping to boost the Nasdaq, after JPMorgan upgraded the stock to “overweight” from “neutral.” With 5 percent of the S&P; 500 companies having reported, 53.8 percent have beaten earnings expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, below the 63 percent historical average. About 62 percent have beaten on revenue, above the long-term 55 percent average. Bank of America Corp, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs  and Morgan Stanley are scheduled to post results later in the week. General Electric Co and Intel are also on tap. In merger news after the market closed on Monday, Google Inc  agreed to buy smart thermostat maker Nest Labs Inc for $3.2 billion. Charter Communications Inc  offered to buy Time Warner Cable for $37.3 billion. Shares of Google rose 1.7 percent to $1,141.97, while Time Warner Cable rose 2.8 percent to $136.06 and Charter added 1 percent to $135.55. Both GameStop Corp and Stratasys Ltd  slumped after giving outlooks that were weaker than expected.

The benchmark S&P; 500 suffered its biggest daily decline since Nov. 7 on Monday as investors exercised caution amid a ream of negative corporate earnings outlooks that suggested the market may be vulnerable with indexes near record levels. The S&P;’s forward price-to-earnings ratio is the highest in nearly seven years, another sign investors may be more selective as the U.S. Federal Reserve begins to slow its stimulus program, which contributed to massive gains in 2013. “If earnings accelerate, and names like JPMorgan have looked strong, then we should still get good returns,” said Mitch Rubin, chief investment officer at RiverPark Advisors in New York. “If not, it will be very difficult for the market to get double-digit market gains amid single-digit earnings growth.” The first of the large banks reported quarterly earnings that beat analysts’ estimates, with a mixed outcome on their share prices; JPMorgan Chase & Co gained 0.5 percent to $58 while Wells Fargo lost 0.8 percent to $45.21. The S&P; financial index advanced 0.5 percent. Retail sales data showed a 0.7 percent increase in December, excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, a rise that was bigger than anticipated. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 77.14 points, or 0.47 percent, at 16,335.08. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  was up 14.34 points, or 0.79 percent, at 1,833.54. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 51.53 points, or 1.25 percent, at 4,164.83. Intel Corp shares jumped 3.8 percent to $26.47, helping to boost the Nasdaq, after JPMorgan upgraded the stock to “overweight” from “neutral.” With 5 percent of the S&P; 500 companies having reported, 53.8 percent have beaten earnings expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, below the 63 percent historical average. About 62 percent have beaten on revenue, above the long-term 55 percent average. Bank of America Corp, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs  and Morgan Stanley are among the financial firms scheduled to post results later in the week. Among other sectors, General Electric Co and Intel are also on tap. Both GameStop Corp and Stratasys Ltd  slumped after giving outlooks that were weaker than expected. GameStop lost 18 percent to $37.01 as the S&P;’s worst performer, while 3D printer maker Stratasys slid 9.3 percent to $117.96.

Financials were the biggest drag on the market after both  Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Citigroup Inc reported that lower bond trading revenue took a bite out of their quarterly profits. Goldman’s earnings fell 21 percent. Citigroup’s profit missed expectations. The results followed fairly positive reads on the financial sector with earnings from Bank of America Corp, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co earlier this week. Goldman’s stock slid 2 percent to close at $175.17. It was the biggest drag on the Dow. Citigroup’s stock dropped 4.4 percent to end at $52.60 and was the biggest negative for the S&P; 500. The S&P; financial sector index fell 0.6 percent, making it the biggest loser among the 10 sectors in the S&P; 500. Analysts said that given the S&P; 500’s gain of 30 percent last year, the market doesn’t need much of a catalyst for selling. “You get a day like today with a little disappointment following a day when the market was up big, and we get a selloff like this,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president of BB&T; Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. Concerns that stock valuations may be too high put some pressure on stocks after last year’s rally. But the S&P; 500 index surged 1.6 percent over the previous two sessions on results and economic data to close at a record high on Wednesday, its first since Dec. 31. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 64.93 points or 0.39 percent, to end at 16,417.01. The S&P; 500 slipped 2.49 points or 0.13 percent, to finish at 1,845.89. The Nasdaq Composite added 3.805 points or 0.09 percent, to close at 4,218.688. Though the earnings season has just started, companies are beating expectations at a rate that’s below the long-term average. With earnings from 6 percent of the S&P; 500 companies so far, 48 percent have exceeded expectations, below the historical average of 63 percent for a full season, Thomson Reuters data showed. After the closing bell, shares of Intel Corp  tumbled 2.4 percent to $25.90 following its results and a lukewarm revenue forecast. In regular trading, Intel had slipped 0.5 percent to end at $26.54. American Express Co shares dipped 0.03 percent to $87.75 in extended-hours trading following the release of its results. American Express shares had ended regular trading at $87.78, down 0.5 percent. During the regular session, UnitedHealth Group Inc  fell 2.8 percent to close at $72.76 after the largest U.S. health insurer said that implementing the national healthcare reform law, often called Obamacare, and funding cuts for private Medicare coverage would result in expenses that would eat into 2014 profit. UnitedHealth, however, reported a higher fourth-quarter profit on Thursday and said 2014 earnings would improve. Shares of UnitedHealth’s major competitors fell as well, including Aetna Inc, down 1.6 percent at $70.23. CSX Corp shares sank 6.8 percent to $27.24 a day after the U.S. railroad reported profits that missed expectations. The stock of Best Buy Co Inc plunged 28.6 percent to close at $26.83, making it easily the S&P; 500’s biggest percentage decliner, followed by CSX. Best Buy, the world’s largest consumer electronics chain, reported a drop in holiday sales and forecast a bigger-than-expected decline in quarterly operating margins. The day’s economic data included initial claims for state unemployment benefits, which slipped 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 326,000 in the week ended Jan. 11. Claims for the prior week were revised to show 2,000 fewer applications received than previously reported, suggesting a sharp slowdown in job growth in December was likely to be temporary. The Consumer Price Index rose 0.3 percent in December while the core CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, edged up only 0.1 percent, suggesting underlying inflation was muted. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business activity index stood at 9.4 points in January, compared with 6.4 in December.

598,INTC,"UPDATE 3-Intel gives lukewarm revenue forecast, shares fall","(Adds detail on results, analyst’s comment, background) By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Intel Corp’s  earnings missed expectations by a penny in the fourth quarter due to weak spending on servers and the chipmaker gave a lukewarm forecast for first-quarter revenue that did little to dispel concerns about a slowing PC industry. Intel said on Thursday it overestimated the extent of a recovery in spending among its data center customers and also pointed to political controversy in Washington, DC. In the December quarter, Intel’s PC revenue stayed flat, which it said was slightly better than the company expected. Microsoft Corp’s plan to stop supporting its Windows XP operating system in April had spurred hopes that some corporations will replace employees’ PCs. But Intel Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said the Windows refresh had a minor impact on the quarter. Personal computer sales are losing ground to tablets and smartphones - a market Intel has been slow to enter - but some analysts believe the industry’s decline is tapering, potentially giving Intel breathing room as it struggles to develop better processors for mobile gadgets. The company has also bet that sales of high-end server chips will help offset lower revenue from PCs this year, as the proliferation of smartphones creates demand for data centers to provide Internet-based services like video and social media. But the 8 percent increase in server revenue in the fourth quarter was less than Intel and some analysts expected. “The incremental nugget we got from Q4 earnings was that datacenter group disappointed again,” said Evercore analyst Patrick Wang. “Investors were anticipating a fairly healthy beat and raise.” Intel forecast revenue of $12.8 billion, plus or minus $500 million, for the first quarter, which ends in March. Analysts had expected $12.79 billion on average. Intel has been slow to adapt its processors for smartphones and tablets, markets now dominated by rivals like Qualcomm Inc   and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. And its core market is crumbling. Global PC shipments fell 10 percent last year, the worst annual drop since research firm Gartner began tracking them. Smith partly blamed Intel’s miss in fourth-quarter server chip sales on quarreling over U.S. fiscal policy. “We saw a tapering off in order patterns across certain customers in certain segments at the end of the quarter and we think that was driven by the government shutdown and the uncertainty around the debt ceiling,” he told analysts. But the CFO pointed to new computing devices, such as PCs with detachable screens and other new designs, as potential growth drivers. “The PC market was a little stronger than we thought,” Smith told Reuters. “What’s driving PCs right now are the innovative form factors we’ve been working on.” At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week, Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich showed off a handful of wearable computing devices including prototype earbuds with a built-in heart rate monitor. But industry-watchers believe smart clothing is not ready to make a splash with consumers anytime soon and is unlikely to make up for much of the business Intel has lost due to a shrinking PC industry. Intel posted fourth-quarter net earnings of $2.6 billion, or 51 cents a share, compared with $2.5 billion, or 48 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter as the chipmaker grapples with a shrinking PC industry and finds support from demand for more servers. Wall Street had expected 52 cents a share on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Fourth-quarter revenue was $13.8 billion, compared with $12.5 billion in the year-ago quarter, it said in a statement on Thursday. Analysts had expected $13.72 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of Intel were down 3.5 percent in extended trade on Thursday after closing 0.5 percent lower at $25.61 on the Nasdaq. One analyst pointed to heightened spending in the first quarter as potentially worrisome. “You’re getting quite a bit less earnings in the first quarter than the Street may have been looking for,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Doug Freedman. “This management team is not running this company to deliver earnings.”   (Editing by Matthew Lewis)",1162014,http://www.reuters.com/article/intel-results/update-3-intel-gives-lukewarm-revenue-forecast-shares-fall-idUSL2N0KQ24120140116

The one cloud on the horizon for the company, which beat expectations with a 7.7 percent rise in fourth-quarter net profit, is a forecast sales slowdown in the first quarter due to a pull-back of purchases ahead of new product launches by smartphone and tablet manufacturers. TSMC said it still expects double-digit growth in sales and profit for 2014. The company is confident that its cutting-edge technologies will help fend off competition from global rivals such as Intel Corp. TSMC is betting on a protracted boom in the mobile devices segment, which includes smartphones and wearable devices, and is investing billions of dollars to pack more processing power in ever shrinking chips. At the recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, “we saw wearable devices emerging in all different kinds of forms,” Mark Liu, one of TSMC’s new co-chief executives told reporters on Thursday. “This will serve as a new driver going forward”. He said the more complex devices will allow TSMC chips to integrate more features like fingerprint sensors, resulting in TSMC earning more dollars per smartphone sold. Liu and the other co-chief executive C.C. Wei, who joined chairman Morris Chang on stage for the first time, took issue with Intel’s assertion that the U.S. company’s latest technology was much more advanced. Liu told an investor conference that what Intel has shown investors was “erroneous and based on outdated data”. “(Our latest generation process) scaling is much better than what Intel said, though still a little bit behind,” Liu said, adding that TSMC has a “far superior” ability to execute a short time to market for customers than Intel and Korean rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. Earlier this week, Intel said it has delayed opening a major factory in Arizona that was originally planned to start producing chips made from the most advanced 14 nanometer process after it was hit by slumping personal computer sales. This year, TSMC is speeding up its technology development to build the tiniest and most powerful chips for smartphones and tablets. TSMC, after dominating the 28-nanometer technology for several quarters, is moving to a more advanced 20-nanometer process with mass production expected this quarter. The smaller the process means more transistors can be added on to a chip, making it more powerful and efficient. It plans to start mass production using a 16 nanometer FinFET process in 2015. TSMC kept its 2014 capital spending plan at around $9.5 billion to $10 billion, the same level as last year. The plan came in below market expectations that it would target another record year of spending after laying out $9.7 billion in 2013. The Taiwanese semiconductor maker had the third-largest capital spending in the chip industry last year, trailing Samsung Electronics, which spent around $22 billion, and Intel which spent around $11 billion. On Thursday, TSMC said it posted a net profit in the fourth quarter of T$44.81 billion, beating analysts’ estimates of $42 billion. The company also said it expects first-quarter revenue to fall as much as 6.7 percent from the previous quarter to between T$136 billion and T$138 billion ($4.52 billion to $4.59 billion), down from T$145.81 billion in the fourth quarter and below market forecasts of T$140.56 billion. The company blamed the projected fall on an industry undergoing an inventory correction in the supply chain due to a pull-back of component purchases ahead of new product launches by mobile gadget companies in a new year.

603,INTC,Intel to reduce global workforce by five percent in 2014,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp plans to reduce its global workforce of 107,000 by about 5 percent this year as the chipmaker, struggling with falling personal-computer sales, shifts focus to faster-growing areas, a company spokesman said on Friday. The announcement, equivalent to over 5,000 positions, comes a day after Intel posted a fourth-quarter earnings report that did little to dispel concerns about a slowing PC industry. “This is part of aligning our human resources to meet business needs,” spokesman Chris Kraeuter said. The job reductions may include retirements, voluntary programs and other options, Kraeuter said, adding that Intel’s typical annual attrition worldwide is about 4 percent. He declined to say whether details of the changes had been announced internally. On a conference call with analysts on Thursday after the earnings release, Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith alluded to a reduction in employment this year and said that Intel would increase investments in areas such as data center technology, low-power chips and tablets. Intel dominates the PC chip industry, but it has been slow to adapt its processors for smartphones and tablets, markets now dominated by rivals such as Qualcomm Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. “If they’ve got a bunch or resources in a market that may not be dead but is not growing a ton, it probably makes sense to reprioritize those investments in areas where there are fast-growing markets,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. Intel has both added and shed significant numbers of jobs over the past decade. Struggling to fend off a challenge by smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc in 2006, Intel announced it would reduce its workforce by over 10,000 positions, but its overall number of employees has grown since then. The chipmaker is also not the only tech company to trim its workforce because of slowing demand for PCs since Apple’s iPad started to cut into demand for laptops in 2010. Hewlett-Packard Co is in the midst of a years-long internal restructuring that would ultimately see it shed 34,000 jobs, or 11 percent of its workforce, through fiscal 2014. Dell succeeded last year in taking itself off public markets, allowing CEO and founder Michael Dell to restructure away from Wall Street’s scrutiny. That overhaul is expected to encompass layoffs. Earlier this week, Intel said a newly built factory in Chandler, Arizona, originally slated as a $5 billion project that in late 2013 would start producing Intel’s most advanced chips, would remain closed for the foreseeable future while other factories at the same site are upgraded. In its report on Thursday, Intel forecast March-quarter restructuring charges of $200 million, a portion of which could be earmarked for severance pay. Last September, Intel said it would close an old factory in Massachusetts, eliminating about 700 jobs. Intel has said it plans to quadruple tablet chip volume this year to 40 million units and aggressively stake out market share ahead of future mobile chip launches. Essentially buying its way into tablets, Intel plans to subsidize its customers’ engineering and manufacturing expenses, effectively reducing its gross margins in 2014 by 1.5 percentage points. Shares of Intel closed 2.6 percent lower at $25.85 on the Nasdaq on Friday. They earlier traded down as low as $25.25.

Hewlett-Packard Co is in the midst of a years-long internal restructuring that would ultimately see it shed 34,000 jobs, or 11 percent of its workforce, through fiscal 2014. Dell succeeded last year in taking itself off public markets, allowing CEO and founder Michael Dell to restructure away from Wall Street’s scrutiny. That overhaul is expected to encompass layoffs. Earlier this week, Intel said a newly built factory in Chandler, Arizona, originally slated as a $5 billion project that in late 2013 would start producing Intel’s most advanced chips, would remain closed for the foreseeable future while other factories at the same site are upgraded. In its report on Thursday, Intel forecast March-quarter restructuring charges of $200 million, a portion of which could be earmarked for severance pay. Last September, Intel said it would close an old factory in Massachusetts, eliminating about 700 jobs. Intel has said it plans to quadruple tablet chip volume this year to 40 million units and aggressively stake out market share ahead of future mobile chip launches. Essentially buying its way into tablets, Intel plans to subsidize its customers’ engineering and manufacturing expenses, effectively reducing its gross margins in 2014 by 1.5 percentage points. Shares of Intel closed 2.6 percent lower at $25.85 on the Nasdaq on Friday.

Volatility picked up late in the session, thanks in part to selling related to options expiration, analysts said. Earnings season is still in the early phase, but S&P; 500 companies so far are beating analysts’ expectations at a rate that’s below what’s typical, according to Thomson Reuters data. Bucking the trend, the Dow ended higher - helped by a rally in American Express Co and Visa. AmEx jumped 3.6 percent to $90.97 a day after reporting quarterly results. Intel’s stock slid 2.6 percent to $25.85 and was among the top weights on each of the three major U.S. stock indexes, a day after the chipmaker gave a lukewarm forecast for first-quarter revenue and posted fourth-quarter earnings that missed expectations by a penny. General Electric shares dropped 2.3 percent to $26.58 after the conglomerate reported disappointing 2013 profit margins. But at least some of the day’s move could have been options related. “January options expiration tends to be among the most volatile, and today’s an example of that,” said Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategist of Delta Global Asset Management in Boston. “Money managers typically take their most aggressive picks during the first part of the year, and a lot of options strategies are involved in those picks.” The Dow Jones industrial average rose 41.55 points or 0.25 percent, to end at 16,458.56. The S&P; 500 fell 7.19 points or 0.39 percent, to finish at 1,838.70. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 21.107 points or 0.50 percent, to 4,197.582. For the week, the Dow rose 0.13 percent, the S&P; 500 slipped 0.20 percent and the Nasdaq gained 0.55 percent. With earnings from 10 percent of the S&P; 500 companies so far, 50 percent have exceeded expectations, below the historical average of 63 percent for a full season, Thomson Reuters data showed. “The market was teased in a good way by some of the first earnings, tempered later with disappointing numbers, and it’s trying to make a sense of what the quarter is going to be,” said John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in New York. Visa shares jumped 4.7 percent to close at $232.18. A U.S. appeals judge appeared to side with the Federal Reserve over a group of retailers in a dispute over the level of fees set by the Fed on the use of debit cards. Among other gainers, Morgan Stanley rose 4.4 percent to $33.40 after previously hitting $33.52, its highest since November 2009. The bank reported a sharp drop in quarterly profit as it was hit by legal bills, but adjusted earnings beat estimates. U.S.-listed shares of Deutsche Bank fell 3 percent to $52.27 after a Wall Street Journal report that the largest German bank is considering a profit warning as executives believe its upcoming quarterly results will be below investors’ expectations. The Dow Jones Transportation Average slipped 0.4 percent. Shares of United Parcel Service Inc fell 0.6 percent to $99.91 and the stock of Con-Way dropped 2 percent to $40.59 after fourth-quarter outlooks. After the S&P; 500’s 30 percent surge in 2013, largely due to stimulus from the Federal Reserve, the benchmark index started the year on a weak note. But the S&P; 500 recovered recently to set a record closing high on Wednesday. The economy, expected to show further signs of recovery as the Fed slowly withdraws its stimulus, gave reassuring signs. Data showed U.S. industrial output rose at its fastest clip in 3-1/2 years in the fourth quarter as factory activity closed out the year on a strong note. Volume was above the average for the month. About 6.8 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the average of 6.6 billion so far this month, according to data from BATS Global Markets.

612,INTC,Intel gives lukewarm revenue forecast; shares fall,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp’s earnings missed expectations by a penny in the fourth quarter due to weak spending on servers, and the chipmaker gave a lukewarm forecast for first-quarter revenue that did little to dispel concerns about a slowing PC industry. Intel said on Thursday it overestimated the extent of a recovery in spending among its enterprise customers, sending its stock lower, and pointed to political controversy in Washington, D.C. In the December quarter, Intel’s PC revenue stayed flat, which it said was slightly better than the company expected. Microsoft Corp’s plan to stop supporting its Windows XP operating system in April had spurred hopes that some corporations will replace employees’ PCs. But Intel Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said the Windows refresh had a minor impact on the quarter. Personal computer sales are losing ground to tablets and smartphones - a market Intel has been slow to enter - but some analysts believe the industry’s decline is tapering, potentially giving Intel breathing room as it struggles to develop better processors for mobile gadgets. The company has also bet that sales of high-end server chips will help offset lower revenue from PCs this year, as the proliferation of smartphones creates demand for data centers to provide Internet-based services like video and social media. But Smith said Intel’s data center group revenues in 2014 would probably come in toward the bottom of his previous growth estimate of 10 percent to 15 percent. The 8 percent increase in server revenue in the fourth quarter was less than Intel and some analysts expected. “The incremental nugget we got from Q4 earnings was that datacenter group disappointed again,” Evercore analyst Patrick Wang said. “Investors were anticipating a fairly healthy beat and raise.” Intel forecast revenue of $12.8 billion, plus or minus $500 million, for the first quarter, which ends in March. Analysts had expected $12.79 billion on average. Intel has been slow to adapt its processors for smartphones and tablets, markets now dominated by rivals like Qualcomm Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. And its core market is crumbling. Global PC shipments fell 10 percent last year, the worst annual drop since research firm Gartner began tracking them. Smith partly blamed Intel’s miss in fourth-quarter server chip sales on quarreling over U.S. fiscal policy. “We saw a tapering off in order patterns across certain customers in certain segments at the end of the quarter, and we think that was driven by the government shutdown and the uncertainty around the debt ceiling,” he told analysts. But the CFO pointed to new computing devices, such as PCs with detachable screens and other new designs, as potential growth drivers. “The PC market was a little stronger than we thought,” Smith told Reuters. “What’s driving PCs right now are the innovative form factors we’ve been working on.” At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week, Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich showed off a handful of wearable computing devices, including prototype earbuds with a built-in heart rate monitor. But industry watchers believe smart clothing is not ready to make a splash with consumers any time soon and is unlikely to make up for much of the business that Intel has lost due to a shrinking PC industry. Intel posted fourth-quarter net earnings of $2.6 billion, or 51 cents a share, compared with $2.5 billion, or 48 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter as the chipmaker grapples with a shrinking PC industry and finds support from demand for more servers. Wall Street had expected 52 cents a share on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Fourth-quarter revenue was $13.8 billion, compared with $13.5 billion in the year-ago quarter, it said in a statement on Thursday. Analysts had expected $13.72 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of Intel slid 4.8 percent in extended-hours trading on Thursday after ending the regular session down 0.49 percent at $26.54 on the Nasdaq. One analyst pointed to heightened spending in the first quarter as potentially worrisome. “You’re getting quite a bit less earnings in the first quarter than the Street may have been looking for,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Doug Freedman. “This management team is not running this company to deliver earnings.” (The story was officially corrects year-ago Q4 revenues to $13.5 bln from $12.5 bln, which was incorrectly stated on Intel’s website) ",1172014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-intel-results/intel-gives-lukewarm-revenue-forecast-shares-fall-idUSBREA0F1PF20140117

614,INTC,Analysis: Verizon deal may push U.S. cable to offer online TV services,"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc’s acquisition of Intel Corp’s venture to create a web-based TV service may be the catalyst that pushes U.S. cable players to start similar products to fend off fast-growing video rivals such as Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc. The deal, announced on Tuesday, came two weeks after Sony Corp revealed it was working on its own cable-like video service and makes it likely that Internet-delivered TV services may be getting closer after attempts from Apple Inc and other technology companies. Amazon has also considering an online TV service, and has been talking with content owners about licensing TV networks, according to the Wall Street Journal. Verizon said it acquired Intel Corp’s OnCue service for an undisclosed sum to accelerate its push into next-generation video services, including integrating it with its FiOS product, the fiber-based Internet and TV offering that has 5.3 million video subscribers, about 5 percent of pay TV households. In a more ambitious move, Verizon also says it intends to deliver “over the top to any device,” which almost certainly would kick off a race to capture eyeballs that will force cable operators to offer standalone services outside their service territories. “For Verizon this could be an opportunity for them to offer a triple play to subscribers in the rest of the country,” said Blair Westlake, who until recently headed Microsoft Corp’s media and entertainment group. “If you’re a Comcast that may get you thinking that it’s time to start offering video in other markets as well.” Verizon has the brand, marketing dollars and customer relationships to make it a viable threat to cable operators, said UBS analyst John Hodulik. There is a likely market waiting for it as well. North American consumers will spend $6 billion in 2014 on entertainment from over-the-top services such as Netflix, more than twice what they spent in 2010, according to PwC’s annual entertainment and media forecast. Cable TV operators, meanwhile, are losing video subscribers to satellite and telecom operators, according to SNL Kagan, putting pressure on their operating margins due to rising programming costs. If Verizon’s move prompts a similar bid from cable companies, it would upset a decades-long balance in the cable TV industry, which operates in near monopoly status with markets carefully carved up by local governments. Customers could choose between Comcast and Time Warner Cable for their video service, or Verizon for that matter. Comcast may be furthest along with a potential over-the-top service with its Xfinity X1 platform, which allows a subscriber to its traditional video service to toggle between live and on-demand programming with a slick interface. A Comcast spokeswoman said the company is focused on getting that product released across its markets and not on an “over-the-top” service. “If Comcast really launches one, it starts a war between all the different cable companies that are already incumbents,” said BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield. “That probably means they fight over price, service and features that are great for the consumer.” It won’t be easy for a new entrant to get started, however. Content owners so far have not granted cable operators the digital rights to sell their shows outside their markets. That has not stopped both cable and satellite companies from eyeing the opportunity. Both Time Warner Cable Inc and satellite operator DirecTV bid on Hulu - the video streaming site owned by Walt Disney Co’s ABC network, Comcast’s NBCUniversal and Fox parent Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. Hulu’s owners, the major content companies, decided instead to invest in it rather than sell it. Charter, which has made a bid to buy No. 2 cable provider Time Warner Cable, has openly floated the idea. “We may sell subscriptions everywhere,” Charter Chief Executive Officer Tom Rutledge said in an November conference call, responding to a question about Charter’s streaming TV application. Cable’s competitors aren’t sitting idle. DirecTV CEO Mike White has said the No. 1 satellite operator is working on an “over-the-top” video package to suit niche audiences, such as Hispanic or kids programming. DirecTV’s rival Dish Network Corp is also eyeing the online opportunity. “We’re thinking of over the top too,” Dish CEO Joe Clayton said on the sidelines of the Consumer Electronics Show in early January. Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson research, is skeptical that online video newcomers such as Sony can be profitable enough to take on the incumbents. When folks start using huge amounts of bandwidth for TV viewing, he predicts Internet bills will jump as providers start charging by usage. “A virtual provider like Sony could be left with a me-too service,” Moffett says, “and an even higher total cost to the end user than the Pay TV subscription they would be hoping to replace.” For some cable operators, this could mean opportunity emerging from the chaos. Cablevision Systems Corp CEO James Dolan, for one, has said he sees a future in which cable operators no longer use their wires to offer video service and instead just offer broadband Internet, which makes more money.

615,INTC,UPDATE 1-Chipmaker AMD forecasts revenue below estimates,"(Adds analysts’ comments, estimates; share movement) Jan 21 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices Inc  forecast a steeper-than-expected fall in current quarter revenue, signaling that sales of gaming consoles were not growing fast enough to offset slowing PC sales. Shares of the company, whose processors are used in Microsoft Corp’s and Sony Corp’s   latest game consoles, were down about 11 percent after the bell. The stock has risen 15 percent in the past month. “When you look at the stock action going into earnings, there was some expectation that consoles would drive better growth in the first quarter,” Evercore Partners analyst Patrick Wang said. AMD has long competed against larger rival Intel Corp  to supply chips for PCs, but as consumers buy fewer laptops and desktops, the company is looking at gaming consoles to drive revenue growth. Microsoft sold more than three million Xbox Ones, while Sony said PlayStation 4 sales reached 4.2 million from their launch in November to the end of the year. AMD on Tuesday said it expects revenue to decrease 16 percent, plus or minus 3 percent, in the first quarter, compared with the fourth quarter ended Dec. 28. This translates to revenue of about $1.34 billion, plus or minus 3 percent. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $1.36 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales of AMD’s chips used in PCs, its core business, fell 13 percent in the fourth quarter. The business accounted for over 45 percent of total revenue in the quarter. Total revenue rose 37 percent to $1.59 billion. Last week Intel gave a lukewarm forecast for first-quarter revenue that did little to dispel concerns about a slowing PC industry. AMD’s net profit was $89 million, or 12 cents per share, in the quarter, compared with a loss of $473 million, or 63 cents per share a year earlier. Excluding items, AMD earned 6 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 5 cents per share on revenue of $1.54 billion. Shares of the company were trading at $3.77 after the bell. They closed at $4.17.

617,INTC,Intel expects to make decision this year on next new chip plant,"TEL AVIV (Reuters) - U.S. chip manufacturer Intel Corp expects to make a decision this year on the location of a new multi-billion dollar semiconductor plant using new 10 nanometer technology, executives at its Israeli unit said on Sunday. Israel is one of a number of countries competing to host the new plant. “Intel will take its decision as late as possible. Until it needs to, it won’t make a decision,” Maxine Fassberg, general manager of Intel Israel, told a news conference. “If we’re looking at the next technology it has to come this year, but we don’t know when.” Intel has already held talks with the Israeli government, which must offer incentives to be competitive, said Fassberg, manager of Intel’s Fab 28 plant in the southern town of Kiryat Gat. “There is no certainty it will be in Israel. The jury is still out; we are in the game,” said Mooly Eden, president of Intel Israel and general manager of perceptual computing. Intel Israel’s exports amounted to $3.8 billion in 2013, down from $4.6 billion the year before. Eden said the 2012 number was inflated by inventory carried over from 2011 as the plant upgraded to improved technology. “Overall I believe we have a healthy growth,” Eden said. In its 40 years in Israel, Intel has invested $10.8 billion in plants and development centers and received $1.5 billion in grants. It employs nearly 10,000 people. It received grants totaling 28 percent of its investment when it built Fab 18, which started operating in Israel in 1999. This amount fell to 15 percent for Fab 28 in 2008, and when it upgraded Fab 28, the grant amounted to only 7 percent, she said. “Together with the Israeli government we will do what needs to be done to stay competitive,” Fassberg said.

619,INTC,UPDATE 1-Facebook cites progress on low-power server technology,"By Noel Randewich SAN JOSE, Calif., Jan 28 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc’s  executive in charge of revolutionizing data centers on Tuesday lauded low-energy server technology that is expected to compete against heavyweight Intel Corp. The social networking firm’s three-year push to help companies design better data center gear is gaining momentum and paying off with a range of cost-saving improvements, Open Compute Project head Frank Frankovsky told an industry conference here. He pointed to plans by some companies to launch server chips based on low-power technology licensed from ARM Holdings , whose technology is widely used in smartphones. “It might be coming to fruition about six months after the most optimistic among us thought, but we are absolutely going to see a much more rich ecosystem in CPU choice as we move through 2014 and into 2015,” said Frankovsky. Servers are the brains and guts of online networks, handling computations and managing tasks. Intel dominates the server market with its powerful Xeon processors and stands to lose if server chips based on a rival architecture catch on. It has launched its own low-power chips in anticipation of a move toward microservers by major Internet players like Facebook and Google. For some kinds of data-center workloads, several chips drawing minimal amounts of electricity and working together can work more efficiently than one of Intel’s brawny server chips, proponents of microservers say. Struggling with a shrinking PC industry, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices has been developing and testing ARM-based chips for servers. Sunnyvale, California-based Applied Micro Circuits is also launching its own ARM-based server processors. Both companies said they would soon start sampling their chips with customers. With off-the-shelf data center products falling behind Facebook’s growing technical requirements, the world’s top social media network in 2011 launched the Open Compute Project to push major technology companies to design and build hardware better-suited to running its massive Internet services. Over the past three years, efforts by Facebook to make its infrastructure more efficient have saved the company over $1.2 billion, said Jay Parikh, vice president of infrastructure. Its collaborative approach, with Facebook sharing its data center standards and asking partners to improve on them, is inspired by open source software projects like Linux, in which developers from different companies contribute and share improvements. Microsoft Corp, a New Open Compute member but a  technology heavyweight not traditionally known for sharing its expertise, has contributed cloud-server specifications that it says significantly reduce costs, as well as source code. Since it started, the project has focused on improved standards for information storage, power supply, hardware racks and other data-center components. While the Open Compute Project’s new standards and products have benefited Facebook, it is not clear how much they are helping smaller companies with different, less-demanding data-center requirements, said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, who was at Tuesday’s event. “After three years ... you would expect many, many enterprises to get up and talk about how they’ve purchased OCP-compliant hardware, but that’s not really happening,” Moorhead said.",1282014,http://www.reuters.com/article/facebook-servers/update-1-facebook-cites-progress-on-low-power-server-technology-idUSL2N0L21LI20140128

621,INTC,STMicro's fourth-quarter revenue stagnates,"(Reuters) - STMicroelectronics NV (STM.PA) posted lower quarterly revenue and a narrow loss on Monday underscoring how the European chipmaker is losing ground to rivals as orders from its key customer Nokia NOK1V.HE shrink. The company, whose chips are used in cars, computers and mobile phones, reported an operating loss of $11 million on fourth-quarter revenue of $2.01 billion. The revenue was lower than the $2.1 billion logged a year ago but largely unchanged from the previous quarter. Analysts had forecast revenues of $2.03 billion on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company had earlier predicted that fourth-quarter sales would be unchanged from the prior three months, plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. After a loss-making third quarter, STMicro pushed back a key profit margin target by six months, blaming higher sales of chips for low-end mobile phones that are not as profitable as chips for high-end phones like Apple’s iPhone or Samsung’s Galaxy line. Last year, STMicro and telecom network gear maker Ericsson ended their joint venture to make chips for mobile phones. Since then, STMicro has refocused on product lines for automobiles, video game consoles, and high-end smartphones, but that move has yet to pay off in terms of higher profits. Franco-Italian STMicro is the eighth-largest semiconductor maker by global sales, but has lost ground to rivals like Qualcomm (QCOM.O), Intel (INTC.O) and Samsung (005930.KS) in recent years because of its higher cost base and the decline of Nokia. Worldwide semiconductor revenue rose 5.2 percent last year to $315.4 billion from $299.9 billion in 2012, according to market research group Gartner. Intel kept the leading spot by sales, despite lower demand for computers that caused its chip sales to fall 2.2 percent, while Samsung and Qualcomm both notched up growth, according to Gartner. STMicroelectronics shares climbed 8.8 percent last year, while Europe’s Stoxx 600 technology index .SX8P rose 27 percent.

622,INTC,"UPDATE 3-Qualcomm says year on track, focuses on China","By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Leading mobile chipmaker Qualcomm Inc posted higher fiscal first-quarter revenue that slightly missed estimates as smartphone growth shifted to China, but it bumped up its full-year earnings outlook and said 2014 was playing out as expected. With growth in the smartphone industry moving away from wealthy markets such as the United States and toward China and other emerging economies, where consumers favor less expensive devices, Qualcomm has been focusing on costs to preserve its profitability. The San Diego, California company said on Wednesday it sold more mobile chips than it expected in the December quarter and that it was making progress in trimming its operating expenses. It expects demand for its chips to grow later this year as leading mobile carrier China Mobile rolls out cellphone services using the advanced LTE technology Qualcomm dominates. Wednesday’s was the first quarterly report since Qualcomm announced in December that Chief Operating Officer Steve Mollenkopf would take over from Paul Jacobs as CEO starting in March. “Our business is getting at the forefront of a technology migration that is occurring in China,” Mollenkopf told Reuters. “For us now, there’s the opening up of the largest carrier there.” Qualcomm slightly increased its full-year forecast for earnings per share to a range of $5.00 to $5.20, from $4.95 to $5.15, essentially adjusting for first-quarter earnings that came in above the company’s own previous estimate. “We raised the full-year EPS guidance but really just to reflect the positive results of Q1. We see the rest of the year playing out pretty much in line with our original expectations,” Chief Financial Officer George Davis said in an interview. Qualcomm had first-quarter net income of $1.88 billion, down 2 percent. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.09. Its non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.26, above its previous forecast of between $1.10 and $1.20. On Monday, lower-than-expected holiday iPhone sales and a weak revenue forecast by Apple Inc, a major Qualcomm customer, renewed fears on Wall Street about Chinese demand and a tepid global market. “It could have been worse, given how sentiment has gotten in the last couple of days,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said of Qualcomm’s quarterly results. While the majority of Qualcomm’s revenue comes from selling baseband chips that let phones communicate with carrier networks, most of its profit comes from licensing patents for its ubiquitous CDMA cellphone technology. As phone prices edge lower, Qualcomm receives less royalty revenue. Average prices for cellphones in the September quarter, used to calculate licensing revenue for Qualcomm in the December quarter, were between $219 and $225, the company said. That was less than the $223 to $229 range that Qualcomm estimated for the June quarter in its previous earnings statement. Mollenkopf said Chinese authorities had told Qualcomm that the substance of an antitrust investigation into the chipmaker, launched in November, were confidential. He said Qualcomm was cooperating but declined to comment further on the investigation, which could potentially lead to a record fine exceeding $1 billion. Qualcomm, founded in 1985, has become the top chip supplier for smartphones and its stock value has surpassed that of Intel Corp. Intel is still the world’s largest chipmaker by revenue but is struggling to gain a foothold in mobile. Qualcomm shares are up about 12 percent over the past 12 months, lower than the S&P; 500’s gain of roughly 18 percent. The chipmaker’s shares trade at about 14 times expected earnings, on par with Intel. Qualcomm reported first-quarter revenue of $6.62 billion, up 10 percent from the year-ago period. Analysts on average had expected first-quarter revenue of $6.665 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It said revenue in the fiscal second quarter, which ends in March, would range from $6.1 billion to $6.7 billion. Analysts on average expect second-quarter revenue of $6.723 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Qualcomm maintained its forecast for 2014 fiscal revenue between $26 billion and $27.5 billion. Its adjusted earnings per share in the first quarter included a 25-cent gain from the sale of its Omnitracs logistics business as well as a 20-cent impairment charge. The company said that those and other smaller items added a net 4 cents per share to adjusted earnings. Qualcomm shares were up 2.8 percent in extended trading after closing down 1.21 percent at $71.12 on Nasdaq.",1302014,http://www.reuters.com/article/qualcomm-results/update-3-qualcomm-says-year-on-track-focuses-on-china-idUSL2N0L329F20140130
623,INTC,Intel tightens executive pay as PC demand slows,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp, wrestling with shrinking personal computer sales and struggling to expand into mobile devices, said on Monday it was tightening its compensation policy to make senior executives more accountable. The steps to push executives to perform better were the latest indication that Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich, who took over almost a year ago, is streamlining the chipmaker in the face of slow demand. Performance-based equity awards for senior executives will no longer have a minimum value and can fall to zero if shareholder returns do not meet thresholds, Intel said in a letter to stockholders on Monday. As well, Intel will require its 350 most senior executives to own company stock. Under the previous policy, only the 50 most senior employees executives had to hold company stock. “One of the top priorities of new CEO Brian Krzanich is to further strengthen our culture of accountability, engagement, and empowerment,” Intel said in the letter. Since replacing previous CEO Paul Otellini in May 2013, Krzanich has made major changes, including plans to make Intel’s prized production lines broadly available to chip designers willing to pay, and reorganizing Intel’s business divisions to make them more accountable to him. Intel said it has no foreseeable plans to hand out retention grants to its senior leadership. In 2012, after Otellini announced plans to step down, Intel paid retention grants to a handful of its top executives to keep them from leaving at a sensitive time.

624,INTC,Intel tightens executive pay as PC demand slows,"SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Intel Corp, wrestling with shrinking personal computer sales and struggling to expand into mobile devices, said on Monday it was tightening its compensation policy to make senior executives more accountable. The steps to push executives to perform better were the latest indication that Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich, who took over almost a year ago, is streamlining the chipmaker in the face of slow demand. Performance-based equity awards for senior executives will no longer have a minimum value and can fall to zero if shareholder returns do not meet thresholds, Intel said in a letter to stockholders on Monday. As well, Intel will require its 350 most senior executives to own company stock. Under the previous policy, only the 50 most senior employees executives had to hold company stock. “One of the top priorities of new CEO Brian Krzanich is to further strengthen our culture of accountability, engagement, and empowerment,” Intel said in the letter. Since replacing previous CEO Paul Otellini in May 2013, Krzanich has made major changes, including plans to make Intel’s prized production lines broadly available to chip designers willing to pay, and reorganizing Intel’s business divisions to make them more accountable to him. Intel said it has no foreseeable plans to hand out retention grants to its senior leadership. In 2012, after Otellini announced plans to step down, Intel paid retention grants to a handful of its top executives to keep them from leaving at a sensitive time. Last year, Krzanich’s total compensation was $9.1 million, down from $15.7 million the year before, when he was chief operating officer and received a retention payment.

625,INTC,Intel aims to boost corporate demand with high-end server chip,"SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Intel Corp  unveiled a new high-end processor aimed at boosting lackluster demand from corporate customers like banks and retailers. With Intel’s core market of personal computers shrinking, the chipmaker’s server business is becoming increasingly important. But its growth has recently fallen short of expectations. Diane Bryant, general manager of Intel’s Data Center Group, told reporters on Tuesday the new Xeon chip is aimed at customers like retailers, airlines, stock exchanges and credit card companies keen to instantly crunch growing troves of data. The new Xeon chip is twice as efficient as its previous generation and allows more data to be held in memory instead of on hard drives so that it can be quickly analyzed. “The Xeon E7 v2 will give a highly anticipated boost to enterprise IT, giving them the ability to deploy new capabilities that were previously impossible,” Bryant said. In the quarter ended in December, the Data Center Group’s sales grew 7 percent, below the company’s expectations due to slow spending by enterprise, a category that includes corporations and governments. However, demand from Web-based companies was robust. Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said in January that weak demand from enterprise customers meant the Data Center Group’s revenues this year would probably come in toward the bottom of his previous growth estimate of 10 percent to 15 percent. While Intel’s laptop and desktop chips typically sell for prices in the low hundreds of dollars, its top-of-the-line server processors may sell for thousands of dollars each, boosting the company’s profit margins. Bryant said the new Xeon server chips will make it easier for credit card companies to instantly analyze past transactions and send useful data to retailers looking to sell products to customers in their stores. As another example of a growing field known as Big Data, Bryant said airlines have begun to use predictive analytics to head off unscheduled maintenance needs and reduce the number of flight cancellations.",2182014,http://www.reuters.com/article/intel-servers/intel-aims-to-boost-corporate-demand-with-high-end-server-chip-idUSL2N0LN1EA20140218
626,INTC,"UPDATE 1-Alcatel to stay out of telecom price war, inks Intel deal","By Leila Abboud BARCELONA, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Alcatel-Lucent said it would stay out of a brewing price war in the telecom equipment market and set itself apart with better service and new products, including those from a partnership announced on Sunday with Intel Corp. Chief Executive Michel Combes said Alcatel-Lucent wanted to gain market share but not at any cost, as it entered the second year of a three-year turnaround aimed at restoring regular profits and cutting 1 billion euros of costs. Analysts predicted that competition could intensify this year among telecom equipment vendors after Nokia’s NSN unit  forecast lower operating margins as it tries to rebuild revenues lost after a bout of restructuring. A newly aggressive NSN could spark reactions from Sweden’s Ericsson  and China’s Huawei. “All the players in the sector have understood that competition based on price was not the right answer,” Combes said on the sidelines of Mobile World Congress, the wireless industry’s largest annual conference. “Differentiation is the right way. Each company must find its areas of excellence and deliver on the services promised to customers,” he said. NSN Chief Executive Rajeev Suri said on Sunday that the group would not compete agressively on price across the board, despite its aim to return to revenue growth by the second half of the year. “It’s about being selective and targeted on pricing,” he said at a press conference. At Alcatel’s event, Combes unveiled a partnership with chip maker Intel under which the two will share the costs of research and development on cloud computing and security. Known as network function virtualization, the technology allows telecom operators to rely more on software to run their networks and less on hardware, which can over time bring down costs. Other telecom gear makers are also pitching such products. NSN said it had carried out over 50 commercial trials with carriers to explore such cloud technology. The Intel accord is the second R&D; partnership announced since Combes took over as CEO in April 2012, and he pledged more to come. Mobile chip maker Qualcomm took an undisclosed stake in Alcatel in July 2013 as part of a research partnership on so-called small cells, which are small mobile antennas to help operators cover urban areas. The Intel partnership does not involve any direct purchase of Alcatel’s shares, but Combes said the two would invest “several hundred million euros each” with the aim of possibly launching products for sale this year. “We can be first to market with products by working with partners,” said Combes. Alcatel-Lucent halved its net loss last year as Combes’ turnaround plan kicked in, helped by a capital increase and bond to shore up the company’s balance sheet and 10,000 layoffs. The shares have more than tripled in value in the past year and closed at 3.15 euros on Friday, giving the company a market capitalisation of 8.77 billion euros.",2232014,http://www.reuters.com/article/mobile-world-alcatel-intel/update-1-alcatel-to-stay-out-of-telecom-price-war-inks-intel-deal-idUSL6N0LS0Z920140223

628,INTC,UPDATE 1-Chinese state-owned firm offers to buy chipmaker Montage,"March 10 (Reuters) - A Chinese state-owned company offered to buy Montage Technology Group, a Shanghai-based chipmaker, in a deal valued at about $600 million, roughly four months after failing to buy rival RDA Microelectronics Inc . Shanghai Pudong Science and Technology Investment Co Ltd offered $21.50 per Montage share in cash, a 25 percent premium to the company’s closing price on Friday. Shares of Montage, which counts Intel Corp among its top shareholders, were up 19.5 percent at $20.51 in early trading on the Nasdaq. The fabless chipmaker, which went public at $10 per share in September, makes analog and mixed-signal chips for set-top boxes and servers for cloud computing, and counts the world’s four largest DRAM chipmakers as its customers. Topeka Capital Markets analyst Suji De Silva said it was difficult to predict if there would be rival offers since Montage was not a cellphone-focused chipmaker, unlike RDA and Spreadtrum Communications Inc. “But the price seems low, so there could be chance of topping up,” De Silva said. China, home to the largest number of mobile phone users in the world, is investing heavily to improve its broadband infrastructure. That was one reason Shanghai Pudong Science, owned by the Pudong New Area government of Shanghai, offered to buy RDA in September. But its offer was topped by Tsinghua University-funded Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd with a bid of $910 million. Tsinghua also said in July it would buy Spreadtrum for a raised offer of about $1.78 billion. Montage last month came under fire from short-seller Gravity Research which said the company’s revenue was “significantly lower” than reported, and that one of its largest distributors was “nothing more than a shell company.” (ttp://link.reuters.com/vax66v) Montage has refuted the allegations.

630,INTC,"Intel lead on conflict minerals helps, challenges other firms","March 13 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Intel Corp has spent more than five years figuring out how to rid its supply chain of minerals that finance violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo region, and now it is offering to show other companies how they can do the same. Intel’s offer to “open source” its methods for verifying that none of its products contain minerals from armed groups involved in the DRC conflict could save other companies significant amounts of money and give them a head start in meeting new U.S. regulations that require them to certify their products are conflict free. “For us, this has always been about doing the right thing,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said at a meeting in the U.S. Senate offices on Wednesday with DRC officials where he announced the move. Its decision to work on stanching a multimillion dollar mineral trade - used by rebel groups to finance one of the world’s longest running and most brutal conflicts - stands in contrast to how leading representatives of corporate America have responded to the tragedy. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Business Roundtable and National Association of Manufacturers have sued to overturn or limit the conflict minerals rule, adopted by Congress in 2010. They argued before the U.S. Court of Appeals in January that it is impractical, too costly, and would force them to make political statements about the content of their products, in violation of their First Amendment freedom of speech rights. At the heart of their arguments is that business should not be dragged into fundamentally political issues and that they should not be held responsible for righting the wrongs of the world. Strategically their lawsuit is a pushback against the trend for global corporations to take more responsibility for labor conditions, environment, corruption and human rights - issues that traditionally were the realm of the state. Over the past two decades, transnational corporations have grown bigger and more powerful than many states where they operate, and their global supply chains have turned them into empires affecting broad swathes of people. With that power have come new responsibilities. At first corporations embraced voluntary accords to address human rights concerns, starting with audits of fair labor standards after child labour scandals in the garment industry in the 1990s. But the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh in April 2013, which killed more than 1,000 workers, exposed the limitations of corporate compacts and audits of their supply chain. Voluntary accords have succeeded in setting a commonly agreed set of global standards, said Arvind Ganesan, director of the business and human rights division of Human Rights Watch. The technology industry has agreed on privacy standards; security standards have been negotiated. The United Nations has formed the Global Compact for business members who sign up to a common framework for human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. The U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights in 2011 lay out responsibilities. But voluntary accords can only help so much. “The strain today is that we never intended voluntary accords to be the only ones. Our thinking was that they would become law because we rarely see companies or governments adopt human rights out of enlightened self-interest,” Ganesan said. Enter the legislative mandates. Anti-bribery laws have spread in many countries over the past decade. The U.S. and the European Union both require extractives companies to disclose payments to governments in a bid to counter corruption, and there is the U.S. conflicts minerals rule. In the United States, corporate lobbies have challenged both the extractives disclosure and conflict minerals laws in court, arguing they overreach and impose too heavy a burden on business. Certainly they can carry sizable costs. The Securities and Exchange Commission estimates that about 6,000 companies are affected by the conflict minerals rule and it will cost them between $3 billion and $6 billion to check their supply chain, with ongoing annual costs of $207 million to $609 million. This is where Intel comes in. Carolyn Duran, Intel’s director of supply chain, said it took a long time to develop its system for bagging, tagging and verifying minerals as they reach the smelter. Now the costs are manageable and other companies can benefit by learning from its experience. The benefits are tangible, said Faida Mitifu, the DRC ambassador to the United States. At first reduced demand caused hardship in communities dependent on illegal mines, but as violence has ebbed, it has helped foster peace, she said. “It has had a significant impact and created a more responsible chain,” Mitifu said. “The government has worked closely with the mining companies and put in place a system of certification, and we have noticed very positive progress in terms of the industry, and inward investment.

632,INTC,UPDATE 1-Britain's ARM targets 10 percent of server chip design market by 2017,"(Recasts, adds company comment, industry context) * Growth in wearable smart devices to drive server push * Aims to grab market share from industry leader Intel * Sees value of ARM-based wearables, related devices at $20 bln by 2018 By Michael Gold TAIPEI, March 20 (Reuters) - Britain’s ARM Holdings PLC , whose chip designs feature in most smartphones, has started designing chips for servers with a market share goal of 10 percent in three years, to capitalise on the growing data demands of wearable smart devices. Technology companies from Google Inc to HTC Corp  are investing heavily in wearables such as watches and spectacles, which add to the strain on servers when sending and receiving real-time data. The value of wearables and other everyday products equipped with ARM-based embedded connectivity is likely to reach $20 billion in 2018 from $14 billion last year, said Vice-Director of Investor Relations Ian Thornton. In light of that, ARM has started designing chips for servers, and the first chips are scheduled be shipped this year, Thornton said at a news conference in Taipei on Thursday. ARM aims to control 10 percent of the server chip design market by 2017, Thornton said, taking share from rivals such as industry-leader Intel Corp in the process. The company is working with Hewlett-Packard Co and Dell Inc to put ARM-designed chips into the servers of two of the leading manufacturers, Thornton said. ARM licences its designs to chip manufacturers, and chip buyers pay ARM royalties. Thornton said the royalties from server chips could be as much as $10 million by 2017. “This is a useful extra layer of royalties,” Thornton said. “It’s a nice adjacent market for us to win share in.” That figure pales in comparison with ARM’s royalties from smartphones such as the iPhone and Galaxy ranges from ARM customers Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd . ARM earns just under half its royalties from smartphones, and last month said falling demand for high-end models led to royalties of $130.4 million in the fourth quarter of last year, slightly below analyst estimates. Nevertheless, ARM sees robust growth in the overall smartphone and mobile-computing market, with the value of such ARM-based devices growing to $20 billion by 2018 from $13 billion in 2013, Thornton said.

633,INTC,Intel widens agreement to manufacture chips for Altera,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chipmaker Altera Corp is working with Intel Corp to combine separate components like processors, memory and programmable chips into customized devices in a technique aimed at reducing manufacturing costs and improving performance. The new agreement, to produce what are known in the technology world as “multi-die” devices, builds on a deal announced over a year ago for Intel to open its most advanced factories to produce Altera’s programmable chips, Brad Howe, Altera’s senior vice president of research and development, told Reuters late on Tuesday. It also reflects strategy at Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, to look for growth opportunities in new markets and reduce the company’s reliance on the slowing personal computer industry. Both companies are contributing packaging and semiconductor expertise that will help Altera improve the performance of chips for communications, high-performance computing and military applications. “We’re partnering to bring those technologies together in a single-package solution,” Howe said. Multi-die packaging is aimed at efficiently connecting separately made components as one device. Many of those components could be manufactured together on one silicon die, but in some cases the complexity of doing so can mean higher costs and lower yields of successfully produced components. Connecting discrete components in sophisticated ways can also lead to smaller-form devices that use less energy and let chipmakers more easily mix and match components to produce different variations of chips. Altera is betting that paying for access to Intel’s factories equipped with new 14 nanometer trigate transistor technology will give it an edge over rival programmable chipmaker Xilinx Inc. Intel’s manufacturing agreement with Altera is going “exceptionally well,” Sunit Rikhi, general manager of Intel’s contract manufacturing business, said in a statement on Wednesday. “Our close collaboration enables us to work together in many areas related to semiconductor manufacturing and packaging.” The deal to share Intel’s prized manufacturing technology with Altera is the most notable of its kind so far for Intel. Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said in November he wanted more customers. Far behind rivals in making chips for smartphones and tablets, Intel views adding more manufacturing customers as one way to keep its multibillion-dollar factories operating at optimal levels. In February, Intel said that a new facility built in Chandler, Arizona, originally slated as a $5 billion project to produce its most advanced chips, would remain closed for the foreseeable future.

Many of those components could be manufactured together on one silicon die, but in some cases the complexity of doing so can mean higher costs and lower yields of successfully produced components. Connecting discrete components in sophisticated ways can also lead to smaller form devices that use less energy, and let chipmakers more easily mix and match components to produce different variations of chips. Altera is betting that paying for access to Intel’s factories equipped with new 14 nanometer trigate transistor technology will give it an edge over rival programmable chipmaker Xilinx Inc. “Things are going exactly as we’d expect them to be going,” Altera’s Howe said. “We’re very committed jointly to a successful program.” The deal to share Intel’s prized manufacturing technology with Altera is the most notable of its kind so far for Intel. Chief executive Brian Krzanich said in November he wanted more customers. Far behind rivals in making chips for smartphones and tablets, adding more manufacturing customers is one way for Intel to keep its multi-billion dollar factories operating at optimal levels. In February, Intel said that a new facility built in Chandler, Arizona, originally slated as a $5 billion project to produce Intel’s most advanced chips, would remain closed for the foreseeable future.

639,INTC,Intel takes 'significant' stake in Big Data startup Cloudera,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp said on Thursday it made a significant investment in Cloudera and will make the fast-growing startup its preferred distributor of software for crunching Big Data. The top chipmaker said its equity investment in Cloudera makes it the company’s single largest strategic shareholder and it comes as Intel looks to expand its server business to make up for falling sales of personal computers. Intel said the stake in Cloudera is its largest data center technology investment ever, although it did not disclose the size of the deal. Cloudera, like rivals HortonWorks and Pivotal, focuses on helping corporate customers manage data through “Hadoop,” an open-source software system that can sort and handle the massive amounts of information, increasingly called Big Data, generated through the Internet and mobile devices. Intel said it will promote Cloudera’s Hadoop platform and transition away from its own customized version that it had been promoting as optimal for Intel server chips. Cloudera will now engineer its Hadoop offerings to work best with Intel’s server chip technology, which enjoys around 94 percent market share in data centers. Intel will have a seat on the board of directors of Cloudera, which is widely expected to go public this year. Shares of Intel were unchanged at $25.38. Intel hopes that encouraging more companies to leap into Big Data analysis will lead to higher sales of its high-end Xeon server processors. With Intel’s core market of personal computers shrinking, the chipmaker’s server business is becoming a larger component of the company’s profits. But its growth has recently fallen short of expectations. Big Data is also a key part of the Internet of Things, a term referring to the increasing connectivity of everyday devices from cars to smoke alarms. Finding ways to analyze and make use of vast amounts of data collected by those smart devices is becoming a major opportunity for IT companies including Intel. After falling behind in making chips for smartphones and tablets, Intel aims to make sure it is a major player in the Internet of Things by supplying processors used in new devices as well as the server hardware and software used to analyze the data those devices create. “Hadoop, as the data platform, and the investment we are making together to make sure it’s the platform of choice, becomes the connection between those two major initiatives at Intel: the Internet of Things and the data center,” Diane Bryant, senior vice president and general manager of Intel’s Data Center Group, said on a webcast.

The chipmaker’s investment values the startup, expected to go public later this year, at about $4.1 billion. In the release, Cloudera announced the completion of a $900 million round of funding, which it said includes Intel’s previously undisclosed stake and another $160 million that was announced earlier in March from T Rowe Price, Google Ventures and others.

The size of Intel’s investment in Cloudera and the end of its own Hadoop customization underscores a willingness by CEO Brian Krzanich to move decisively since taking over a year ago with the personal computer industry in a tailspin. Cloudera is only one of several Silicon Valley startups to receive multibillion-dollar valuations from investors recently, a trend that has some on Wall Street concerned about lofty prices.

The closure of the site, which is a significant contributor to Costa Rica’s exports, falls within a larger plan announced by the chipmaker earlier this year to cut spending as it attempts to grow beyond PCs into the mobile market. “It’s being closed and consolidated into our other operations throughout the world,” spokesman Chuck Mulloy said of the assembly and test operations in Costa Rica. During the next two quarters, Intel will move assembly and testing from its site in Heredia, where it has been present since 1997, to existing sites in China, Malaysia and Vietnam, Mulloy said. Still, Intel will continue to have over 1,000 engineers finance and human resources employees in Costa Rica and do some research and development there. The chipmaker expects to add another 200 “high-value positions” in Costa Rica later this year, Mulloy said. Intel dominates the PC chip industry, but it has been slow to adapt its processors for smartphones and tablets, markets now dominated by rivals like Qualcomm Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. The cuts in Costa Rica are consistent with Intel’s announcement in January that it would reduce its global workforce of 107,000 employees by about 5 percent this year, Mulloy said. Also in January, Intel said a newly built factory in Chandler, Arizona, originally slated as a $5 billion project that in late 2013 would start producing Intel’s most advanced chips, would remain closed for the foreseeable future while other factories at the same site are upgraded.

652,INTC,"UPDATE 3-Intel closes Costa Rica operation, cuts 1,500 jobs","(Adds comment from Costa Rica president elect) By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, April 8 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel, struggling with a shrinking personal computer market, is shutting its assembly and test operation in Costa Rica and eliminating 1,500 jobs, a spokesman said on Tuesday. The closure of the site, which is a significant contributor to Costa Rica’s exports, falls within a larger plan announced by the chipmaker earlier this year to cut spending as it attempts to grow beyond PCs into the mobile market. “It’s being closed and consolidated into our other operations throughout the world,” spokesman Chuck Mulloy said of the assembly and test operations in Costa Rica. During the next two quarters, Intel will move assembly and testing from its site in Heredia, where it has been present since 1997, to existing sites in China, Malaysia and Vietnam, Mulloy said. Costa Rica President Elect Luis Guillermo Solis met with Intel executives on Tuesday morning and they assured him the decision had nothing to do with the election of his new government on Sunday, according to a statement from Guillermo’s office. “The decision bears no relation to the election of the new Costa Rica government or the market conditions for...potential foreign investment,” the statement said. Intel will continue to have over 1,000 engineers, finance and human resources employees in Costa Rica and do some research and development there. The chipmaker expects to add another 200 “high-value positions” in Costa Rica later this year, Mulloy said. Intel dominates the PC chip industry, but it has been slow to adapt its processors for smartphones and tablets, markets now dominated by rivals such as Qualcomm Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. The cuts in Costa Rica are consistent with Intel’s announcement in January that it would reduce its global workforce of 107,000 employees by about 5 percent this year, Mulloy said. Also in January, Intel said a newly built factory in Chandler, Arizona, originally slated as a $5 billion project that in late 2013 would start producing Intel’s most advanced chips, would remain closed for the foreseeable future while other factories at the same site are upgraded. Shares of Intel closed 1.60 percent higher at $26.91 on Nasdaq.

653,INTC,'Heartbleed' computer bug threat spreads to firewalls and beyond,"BOSTON, April 10 (Reuters) - Hackers could crack email systems, security firewalls and possibly mobile phones through the “Heartbleed” computer bug, according to security experts who warned on Thursday that the risks extended beyond just Internet Web servers. The widespread bug surfaced late on Monday, when it was disclosed that a pernicious flaw in a widely used Web encryption program known as OpenSSL opened hundreds of thousands of websites to data theft. Developers rushed out patches to fix affected web servers when they disclosed the problem, which affected companies from Amazon.com Inc and Google Inc  to Yahoo Inc. Yet pieces of vulnerable OpenSSL code can be found inside plenty of other places, including email servers, ordinary PCs, phones and even security products such as firewalls. Developers of those products are scrambling to figure out whether they are vulnerable and patch them to keep their users safe. “I am waiting for a patch,” said Jeff Moss, a security adviser to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and founder of the Def Con hacking conference. Def Con’s network uses an  enterprise firewall from McAfee, which is owned by Intel Corp’s  security division. He said he was frustrated because people had figured out that his email and Web traffic is vulnerable and posted about it on the Internet - but he can’t take steps to remedy the problem until Intel releases a patch. “Everybody is going through the exact same thing I’m going through, if you are going through a vendor fix,” he said. An Intel spokesman declined comment, referring Reuters to a company blog that said: “We understand this is a difficult time for businesses as they scramble to update multiple products from multiple vendors in the coming weeks. The McAfee products that use affected versions of OpenSSL are vulnerable and need to be updated.” It did not say when they would be released. The Heartbleed vulnerability went undetected for about two years and can be exploited without leaving a trace, so experts and consumers fear attackers may have compromised large numbers of networks without their knowledge. Companies and government agencies are now rushing to understand which products are vulnerable, then set priorities for fixing them. They are anxious because researchers have observed sophisticated hacking groups conducting scans of the Internet this week in search of vulnerable servers . “Every security person is talking about this,” said Chris Morales, practice manager with the cybersecurity services firm NSS Labs. Cisco Systems Inc, the world’s biggest telecommunications equipment provider, said on its website that it is reviewing dozens of products to see if they are safe. It uncovered about a dozen that are vulnerable, including a TelePresence video conferencing server, a version of the IOS software for managing routers. A company spokesman declined to comment on how those issues might affect users, saying Cisco would provide more information as it became available. Oracle Corp has not posted such an advisory on its support site. Company spokeswoman Deborah Hellinger declined to comment on Heartbleed. Microsoft Corp, which runs a cloud computing and storage service, the Xbox platform and has hundreds of millions of Windows and Officer users, said in a statement that “a few services continue to be reviewed and updated with further protections.” It did not identify them. Officials with technology giants IBM and Hewlett-Packard Co could not be reached. EMC Corp  and Dell said they had no immediate comment. Security experts said the vulnerable code is also found in some widely used email server software, the online browser anonymizing tool Tor and OpenVPN, as well as some online games and software that runs Internet-connected devices such as webcams and mobile phones. Jeff Forristal, chief technology officer of Bluebox Security, said that version 4.1.1 of Google’s Android operating system, known as Jelly Bean, is also vulnerable. Google officials declined comment on his finding. Other security experts said that they would avoid using any device with the vulnerable software in it, but that it would take a lot of effort for a hacker to extract useful data from a vulnerable Android phone.

654,INTC,"Exclusive: Microsoft, Apple diverge on bankrolling big patent buyer","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Patent buyer Intellectual Ventures has persuaded Microsoft and Sony to invest in its latest acquisition fund while Apple and Intel, which invested with IV previously, declined to participate, according to people briefed on the fundraising. The investment decisions by four technology companies come in the midst of a heated debate over whether it is too easy for patent owners to extract large royalty payments, and whether patent buying firms spur or stifle innovation. Last year IV curtailed patent acquisitions as it sought new investors, and IV now is ramping up, say three sources familiar with IV’s activity in the patent market. “Microsoft and Sony’s investments give IV a fresh war chest to buy new patents,” said Kevin Jakel, chief executive of Unified Patents, which advises tech companies on alternatives to patent aggregators like IV. But Apple and Intel’s decision is significant because the biggest tech companies have supported IV in the past. “This would be a dramatic departure,” Jakel said. Intellectual Ventures declined to discuss investments. Microsoft, Sony, Intel and Apple also would not comment. It is unclear whether Intel and Apple could still opt to invest in IV’s vehicle at a later time. Created in 2000, Intellectual Ventures has raised about $6 billion and acquired 70,000 patents and other intellectual property assets. The company is seeking to raise $3 billion more, a 2013 investor presentation reviewed by Reuters shows. Over the years IV and other firms like it have faced criticism from some in the technology industry, who argue that firms like IV, which do not primarily make products, exploit the patent system by demanding royalties and threatening litigation. IV argues that by buying patents from inventors, it creates a mechanism for them to capitalize on their ideas. Several large tech companies previously invested in IV, which gave them low-cost licenses to IV’s vast patent portfolios as well as a portion of royalties IV collected. Microsoft Corp, Sony Corp, Apple and Intel all invested in IV’s previous funds, court filings show. Prior to co-founding IV, Nathan Myhrvold was chief technology officer at Microsoft working closely with Bill Gates. Another IV co-founder, Peter Detkin, was previously an Intel in-house lawyer. IV’s fundraising comes as a proposal to make it easier to fight patent lawsuits passed the House of Representatives last year and is currently pending in the Senate Judiciary Committee. Some companies like Google Inc publicly supported the bill, which included a provision to make it easier for the winner of a patent lawsuit to recover legal fees. Google invested in IV’s first fund in 2003 but has said it declined to participate in subsequent ventures. IV sued Google’s Motorola Mobility unit in 2011, and that litigation is ongoing. Microsoft and Apple were among seven major corporations which warned last week against weakening the patent system and hurting innovative companies. Still, Microsoft reiterated on Friday that it “applauds” the pending bill. Amy Landers, an intellectual property professor at University of the Pacific McGeorge School of Law, said Apple and Intel’s decision on IV’s latest fund was probably unrelated to the political debate on patent reform. “The companies that are not investing in the fund have probably just found better uses for their money,” Landers said. At the end of 2012 the average rate of return for IV’s 2003 fund was 16.2 percent, while the 2008 fund stood at 2.5 percent, according to the 2013 investor presentation. In a court filing last year, Intellectual Ventures said it has earned more than $3 billion to date in licensing fees. Patent buyers also are facing some competition from companies like Unified Patents, which argue that tech companies should try to invalidate threatening patents instead of just financing aggregators like IV to acquire them. “I think there’s a recognition by a lot of companies that simply trying to buy your way out of the problem is like bailing water from a sinking ship,” Jakel said. Jakel declined to disclose whether any of the tech companies in this report are clients.

655,INTC,"Intel's quarterly net beats Street, CEO talks up tablets","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp’s first-quarter net profit exceeded Wall Street’s estimates as the chipmaker wrestles with slow demand for personal computers and its chief executive officer said an ambitious goal to stake out market share in tablets was on track. With personal computer shipments falling for eight straight quarters through March, some analysts believe the industry’s decline is close to hitting bottom, potentially giving Intel breathing room as it struggles to develop better processors for mobile and wearable devices. Following its first-quarter report on Tuesday, Intel Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said the chipmaker continues to expects PC shipments to decline slightly in 2014. “But there are pretty clear signs of stabilization,” Smith told Reuters. “You have an ageing install base of PCs and we’re bringing exciting products to the market place and that’s leading to the pockets of strength we’re seeing in the PC market.” In its report, Intel said revenue from its PC client group in the first quarter was $7.9 billion, down 1 percent from the year before. The company also expects a full-year gross margin of 61 percent, plus or minus a few percentage points. That is 1 percentage point higher than Intel’s previous forecast. Intel shares rose 1.6 percent in extended trading after closing up 0.80 percent at $26.77 on Nasdaq. “The margin guidance is what’s pushing the stock up. The PC client group was roughly in line with seasonal,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. Tuesday’s results included a new financial reporting structure to better reflect its focus on two small key areas: mobile and the growing field of linking up electronic devices, known as Internet of Things. Intel in recent years has been slow to adapt its chips for smartphones and tablets and is rushing to catch up with mobile leader Qualcomm. Intel said its mobile and communications group had revenue of $156 million in the first quarter, down 61 percent from the year-ago quarter. Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich told analysts on a conference call that Intel shipped 5 million tablet chips in the first quarter and is on track to reach a goal of shipping 40 million tablet chips in 2014. Last year, Intel shipped 10 million tablet chips and to reach its target for 2014, the company is offering to heavily subsidize manufacturers’ costs to include its components in their future tablets. Asked whether Intel expected that some of those mobile chips might be used in low-end laptops instead of tablets, CFO Smith said: “We mean 40 million tablets with Intel chips in them by the end of this year, with the majority of those being Android-based tablets.” After underestimating the impact of smartphones and tablets, Intel is keen to make sure it is part of an emerging trend toward wearable computing devices such as smart watches. In March, it bought Basis Science, the maker of a wearable health tracker, as part of that push. But industry watchers believe smart clothing is not ready to make a major splash with consumers any time soon. Analysts are skeptical that chips for wearables will be able to make up for much of the business that Intel has lost because of the shrinking PC industry. Intel’s data center group, a big contributor to the company’s overall profits, had revenue of $3.1 billion in the first quarter, up 11 percent year over year. The chipmaker reported first-quarter net earnings of $1.947 billion, or 38 cents a share, compared with $2.045 billion, or 40 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Analysts on average expected 37 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. First-quarter revenue was $12.76 billion, compared with $12.58 billion in the year-ago quarter, Intel said in a statement on Tuesday. Analysts had expected $12.814 billion.

657,INTC,"GLOBAL MARKETS-Ukraine worries weigh on global shares, drive up bonds","* Wall St ends higher as blue chips rally; Intel up late * Bonds rise on safety buying * Russia says Ukraine on brink of civil war * Brent oil falls as investors weigh Libya, Ukraine   (Adds close of U.S. markets) By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, April 15 (Reuters) - Global equity markets traded flat and government debt rose on Tuesday over rising tensions in Ukraine after Russia declared the country on the brink of civil war, though Wall Street stocks managed to end higher in a volatile session as blue chips advanced. But weakness in many momentum names — the technology and biotechnology shares that have been high-flyers — limited the Nasdaq’s advance. Concerns over escalating conflict in Ukraine drove U.S. bond purchases, while data showing disappointing growth in manufacturing in New York state pointed to sluggishness in the economy and added to the bid for safe-haven bonds. Separately, confidence among U.S. homebuilders remained downbeat, according to the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index, which rose only a point to 47 in April, the third month in a row it was below 50. Readings below 50 mean more builders view market conditions as poor than favorable. European stocks were held back by the worries over the escalating tensions in Ukraine and weak results by bellwethers including Nestle. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares closed down 0.96 percent at 1,306.85 and kept a damper on a measure of global equity activity. Dow components Coke and J&J; rose after reporting quarterly results, while names in the Internet and biotech space fell, a sign investors were rotating from growth into value stocks. High-growth stocks have been under pressure in recent weeks after their sharp rise in prices took valuations to levels considered unsustainable. The Nasdaq Biotech index rebounded 0.9 percent after earlier trading down more than 3.5 percent. “The market is trying to stabilize, and investors are looking for high-quality names that have stability in their earnings and prices,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland. “This afternoon’s move is part of that same flight to quality.” Russia declared Ukraine on the brink of civil war as Kiev said an “anti-terrorist operation” against pro-Moscow separatists was under way, with troops and armored personnel carriers seen near a flashpoint eastern town. “We’re cautious in the short term, we’re waiting to see how the geopolitical situation evolves. There are a lot of uncertainties about Ukraine, which could become a negative catalyst for stocks if things spin out of control,” said Barclays France director Franklin Pichard. MSCI’s all-country world stock index traded flat after Wall Street’s close. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 89.32 points, or 0.55 percent, to 16,262.56, the S&P; 500 gained 12.37 points, or 0.68 percent, to 1,842.98, and the Nasdaq Composite  added 11.467 points, or 0.29 percent, to 4,034.161. After the closing bell, Intel Corp shares rose 3 percent to $27.56 after the chipmaker reported first-quarter results and gave an outlook. Yahoo Inc shares jumped 8 percent in after-hours trade, to $36.90. The company reported only a slight rise in its core advertising business in the first quarter, but the shares jumped on strong results from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, the Chinese e-commerce company in which Yahoo holds a 24 percent stake. Over all, corporate results have been weak so far. Of the 36 companies in the S&P; 500 that have reported earnings to date for the first quarter, only 52.8 percent have topped analyst expectations. In a typical quarter over the past two decades, 62 percent of companies beat estimates. U.S. Treasuries prices gained as the rising tensions in Ukraine sparked a safety bid. Benchmark 10-year notes were up 3/32 in price to yield 2.6301 percent. The dollar rose slightly against the euro in late trade. The euro recovered against the dollar on Monday after the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, indicated over the weekend that the central bank would act to prevent deflation in the euro zone. The dollar edged higher against the euro, up 0.04 percent at $1.3813. The dollar was up 0.11 percent against the Japanese yen  at 101.93, and was up 0.06 percent against the Swiss franc, at 0.8801 franc. The U.S. dollar index was last up 0.08 percent. Benchmark Brent oil rose slightly after news that Ukrainian armed forces launched military operations in the east of the country, though gains were limited by the prospect of a resumption of oil exports from Libya. U.S. crude futures fell 30 cents to settle at $103.75. The June contract for Brent, which will become the front-month contract on Wednesday, settled 29 cents higher at $109.36 a barrel.

Coke and J&J;, both Dow components, climbed after their results while recent outperformers fell, a sign that investors were rotating from growth stocks into value ones. In recent weeks, high-growth stocks  have been under pressure after a meteoric rise in their prices took valuations to levels that appeared unsustainable. The three major U.S. stock indexes fell for much of the session before rebounding in afternoon trading. The Nasdaq moved in a 108.77-point range, and at its lows of the day, it was within 0.3 percent of 3,934.53, the level that represents a 10 percent drop from its recent intraday peak, hit on March 6. “The market is trying to stabilize, and investors are looking for high-quality names that have stability in their earnings and prices,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland, Ohio. “This afternoon’s move is part of that same flight to quality.” Coca-Cola Co jumped 3.7 percent to $40.18 as one of the S&P; 500’s biggest gainers after the world’s largest beverage maker reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue, helped by strong sales in China. Johnson & Johnson rose 2.1 percent to $99.20 after the pharmaceuticals and consumer products company posted earnings that beat expectations and raised its full-year profit view. Among the most active “momentum” names, shares of electric car maker Tesla Motors Inc fell 2.1 percent to $193.91 and shares of online movie rental company Netflix Inc  dropped 1.6 percent to $326.27. Intuitive Surgical  shares fell 1.9 percent to $417.09. “We’re going through a period of rolling corrections, which will consolidate the high-growth names that did so great last year,” said Hayes Miller, head of asset allocation in North America at Baring Asset Management in Boston. “I don’t read anything systemic into the action, as seen by the gains in more defensive areas. The losses should remain contained.” After the closing bell, Intel Corp shares rose 3 percent to $27.56 in extended-hours trading after the chipmaker reported its first-quarter results and gave an outlook.  Yahoo Inc shares rose 1.4 percent to $34.70 after the bell following the company’s results. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 89.32 points, or 0.55 percent, to end at 16,262.56.

In the latest economic snapshot, a gauge of manufacturing in New York state grew at a much slower rate in April than it did in March, coming in far below expectations. The U.S. Consumer Price Index increased 0.2 percent in March as food and housing rental costs rose, although inflation pressures remained generally benign. S&P; 500 companies’ first-quarter earnings are projected to have increased just 1 percent from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed. The forecast is down sharply from the start of the year, when profit growth was estimated at 6.5 percent. Twitter Inc shares surged 11.4 percent to close at $45.52 after the company said it bought social data provider Gnip for an undisclosed amount. Aaron’s Inc shares tumbled 4 percent to end at $29.25 after the rent-to-own furniture and electronics retailer said it had rejected a $2.3 billion takeover offer from a major shareholder and instead acquired a retail credit financing firm for about $700 million. Barcode printer maker Zebra Technologies said it would buy Motorola Solutions Inc’s enterprise business, which makes rugged mobile computers, tablets and barcode scanners, for $3.45 billion in cash. Motorola Solutions shares declined 0.6 percent to end at $63.37. Zebra shares tumbled 10.1 percent to close at $61.39. About 58 percent of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange closed higher for the day, while about 50 percent of Nasdaq-listed shares ended lower.

660,INTC,Intel submits plan to upgrade Israeli chip plant,"JERUSALEM, April 30 (Reuters) - U.S. chip manufacturer Intel Corp said on Wednesday it had submitted a business plan to upgrade a facility in southern Israel. An Intel statement did not specify any sum but Israeli media reported the company would invest $6 billion in the Kiryat Gat company, potentially creating thousands of jobs. A spokesman reached by Reuters declined to comment on the figure. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Intel’s plan had been under discussion for several years and welcomed the decision. Praising Israel as a centre of world technology, Netanyahu urged other global companies to expand investment in the country as well. Intel had said in January it would decide on the location of a planned new multi-billion dollar semiconductor plant using new 10 nanometre technology. It said on Wednesday it planned to “upgrade the Kiryat Gat facility to meet future needs,” but that “details of the project, including schedules, costs and technologies are not being disclosed at this time.” Intel Israel’s exports amounted to $3.8 billion in 2013, down from $4.6 billion the year before. In its 40 years in Israel, Intel has invested $10.8 billion in plants and development centres and received $1.5 billion in grants. Intel Israel employs nearly 10,000 people. It received grants totalling 28 percent of its investment when it built the Kiryat Gat plant, called Fab 28, which started operating in Israel in 1999.

661,INTC,Workers exposed to chemical leak at Intel plant in Arizona,"PHOENIX (Reuters) - A chemical leak at Intel Corp’s manufacturing complex in Arizona has been contained and two workers were taken to hospital for observation, a spokesman for the chipmaker said on Monday. During a tool installation in a basement at the sprawling plant southeast of Phoenix a tube was severed, leading to a spill of around 100 gallons (379 liters) of ammonium hydroxide, said Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy. Ten workers near the spill reported to the facility’s medical station and two of those people were sent to hospital for observation, Mulloy said.

664,INTC,Intel hires Staples executive to shake up marketing,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp has hired senior Staples executive Steven Fund to oversee its global marketing, a novel pick that the chipmaker hopes will improve its profile in an industry where laptops have become blasé compared to tablets and smartphones. As chief marketing officer, Fund will report directly to Chief Executive Brian Krzanich, in line with other changes Krzanich has made to have more senior executives report directly to him since taking over the top management post last year. Intel’s previous CMO, Deborah Conrad, reported to the general manager of sales and marketing, Tom Kilroy, who is currently on medical leave. Fund is Krzanich’s first senior hire but only his latest shakeup at the chipmaker, which has been struggling with a shrinking PC industry and a lack of progress selling its products to makers of smartphones and tablets. “As our industry and our business is changing, we need to change the way we develop, build, and market our products, and Steve is going to be a key asset for us as we move forward,” Krzanich said in a statement on Monday. Fund, who was senior vice president of global marketing at Staples, also helped build brands at Procter & Gamble and at Pepsi-Cola, according to the statement. Launched in 1991, the chipmaker’s “Intel Inside” campaign turned commodity electronic components into premium products, and its stickers eventually became ubiquitous on laptops.

Intel in recent years has led personal computer makers in marketing sleek “ultrabook” laptops and two-in-one notebooks that convert into tablets. But those new gadgets have made little headway in stopping a decline in PC sales.

667,INTC,Intel submits plan for nearly $6 bln Israel chip plant upgrade,"JERUSALEM, May 5 (Reuters) - Chip giant Intel Corp  submitted a plan to Israel’s government to invest 20 billion shekels ($5.8 billion) in upgrading its plant in southern Israel, the Economy Ministry said on Monday. The ministry said it promised Intel it would work to expedite bureaucratic procedures as much as possible to develop and promote employment in the country’s south. As part of the investment, Intel would receive a government grant that Israeli media estimated at about 1 billion shekels. They also reported that Intel would add about 1,200 new jobs. It is widely believed that Intel’s investment is aimed at shifting to new 10 nanometre technology. A company spokesman declined to comment but Intel in January had said it would decide on the location of a 10 nanometre plant this year. Israel was one of a number of countries competing to host the new plant. Intel Israel’s exports, mainly from its Fab 28 plant in Kiryat Gat, amounted to $3.8 billion in 2013, down from $4.6 billion the year before. In its 40 years in Israel, Intel has invested $10.8 billion in plants and development centres and received $1.5 billion in grants. It employs nearly 10,000 people.

The penalty, which represented 4.15 percent of Intel’s 2008 turnover versus a possible maximum of 10 percent, came after an eight-year investigation by the European Commission which decided Intel had engaged in anti-competitive practices to block a rival. The European Union competition authority said at the time that Intel sought to thwart Advanced Micro Devices by giving rebates to PC makers Dell, Hewlett-Packard Co, Japan’s NEC and Lenovo for buying most of their computer chips from Intel. The Commission said Intel also paid German retail chain Media Saturn Holding to stock only computers with its chips. The Luxembourg-based General Court will rule on the case on June 12, a court official said. Intel, which can appeal to the EU Court of Justice following the judgement, wants its conviction and fine thrown out or reduced. The case is T-286/09, Intel vs Commission.

669,INTC,Intel trims marketing staff ahead of new chief's arrival,"SAN FRANCISCO, May 14 (Reuters) - Intel Corp is shedding jobs in its marketing department ahead of the arrival of new chief marketing officer Steven Fund, who the struggling chipmaker is betting will restore some shine to its brand. In recent weeks, close to 40 marketing employees have accepted voluntary incentive packages to leave, said two people close to the company who were not authorized to comment. Marketing vice presidents Kevin Sellers and Nancy Bhagat, who would have reported to Fund, are also leaving the chipmaker, the two sources said. The reductions come as the world’s largest chipmaker struggles to revitalize a brand associated with a crumbling PC market. CEO Brian Krzanich said during an online Reddit discussion in February that Intel needed to revamp its marketing to get back some of its “coolness.” Morale among many on the marketing team is at an “all-time low” and contributed to some employees’ decisions to leave, one of the sources told Reuters. The chipmaker’s marketing department has struggled over the past year or two to captivate consumers with new ultrathin laptops and two-in-one tablets. “We all know there’s a problem. If you look at the Interbrand numbers you can see it,” said a third person familiar with Intel’s marketing department. “It was smart to go external, bring in someone with fresh thinking.” Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy declined to confirm how many people had left, but he said they fall within a previously announced plan to trim the chipmaker’s workforce by 5 percent this year. But he said they were not leaving as a reaction to specific problems in the marketing department. Intel’s marketing department had more than 300 employees spread around different business units and offices prior to the cuts, one of the sources estimated. Last week, Intel announced it had hired senior Staples executive Fund as its new chief marketing officer, and that he would report directly to Krzanich when he starts in June. He replaces 27-year Intel veteran Deborah Conrad, who left in March. Launched in 1991, the chipmaker’s “Intel Inside” campaign turned commodity electronic components into premium products, and its stickers eventually became ubiquitous on laptops. But Intel’s brand has lost a little of its glitter in recent years. In 2013, Intel was No. 9 on consulting firm Interbrand’s global ranking, down from No. 7 in 2011. Marketing employees have been split over Krzanich’s decision to hire a new marketing chief from outside the company, unusual for the culturally insular chipmaker. Fund has helped build brands at Procter & Gamble and at Pepsi-Cola. Some Intel staff questioned his lack of technology experience while others at the company said they looked forward to working with him.

670,INTC,Intel's CEO looks to hobbyists for wearable innovations,"SAN MATEO, California (Reuters) - Intel Corp’s Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich mingled with electronics buffs at Silicon Valley’s annual maker mecca on Saturday as the chipmaker looks to amateur inventors to inspire a new wave of smart clothing. With sales of smartphones losing steam, technology companies including Intel believe that wearable computing devices - a still undefined category including smart watches, fitness trackers and Google Glass - could become a major trend in personal computing. But smartwatches and fitness bands launched by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and other tech companies in the past year have yet to really take off. At the Maker Faire in San Mateo, California, Krzanich told Reuters that successful smart clothes will come from individual inventors focused on their own needs. “The trick to making the perfect wearable is going to be when you figure out what problems you’re trying to solve, and I don’t think you’re going to be able to build a wearable that does it all for everyone,” he said. “Who better to design the next athletic wearable than an athlete,” added Krzanich. Thousands of people attended the open-air event, which gives hobbyists and their families a chance to socialize and check out other people’s projects. Among the most popular attractions were demonstrations of flying drones, voice-activated robots and a giant metal octopus shooting fire from its tentacles. Krzanich is a weekend tinkerer in his own right and just finished restoring a 1974 Land Cruiser. Intel is not the only technology company to look to the growing maker movement for inspiration but it has been among the most aggressive. Intel, ARM Holdings, Atmel and other chipmakers all have exhibitions at the weekend event to make sure that hobbyists are up to speed on their latest components. “”These are the future engineers, the future scientists, the guys who will be inventing the next companies that create great products, whether it’s the next Google or Apple. We want them to be aware of Intel technology,” Krzanich said. Intel has set aside over $1 million in awards for contests for people to pitch ideas for wearable gadgets made with Intel technology. Even if Intel becomes a major supplier of chips for wearable and mobile devices, it is unclear whether that business could make up for the slowdown in the PC industry, which Intel has dominated for four decades. Intel has also lagged far behind Qualcomm in smartphones. But the push into wearables is a major prong in Krzanich’s goal to see Intel’s chips used across a range of new markets. Last year, Intel launched Galileo, the chipmaker’s version of the Arduino microcontroller board widely used by hobbyists as the brains in everything from robots to electronic cocktail mixers.

672,INTC,Exclusive: Intel CEO promises Broadwell PCs on shelves for holidays,"SAN MATEO, California (Reuters) - Intel Corp’s next-generation Broadwell processors will ship in time to be used in personal computers sold during the holiday season but probably won’t be available for back-to-school shopping, Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said. Speaking to Reuters at the Maker Faire in San Mateo, California, on Saturday, Krzanich said that following setbacks implementing new manufacturing technology, announced last October, Intel is on schedule to ship its Broadwell chips to PC manufacturers. The timing of new chip rollouts is important to Intel and manufacturers looking to sell new PCs with better battery life and higher speeds. “I can guarantee for holiday, and not at the last second of holiday,” Krzanich said in an interview. “Back to school - that’s a tight one. Back to school you have to really have it on-shelf in July, August. That’s going to be tough.” Krzanich’s comments were more precise than during Intel’s most recent quarterly conference call with analysts in April. On that call, he said he expected Intel’s customers to launch Broadwell-based products in the second half of 2014. The back-to-school season around August, when parents sometimes buy new PCs for their children, has provided smaller sales bumps for PC makers in recent years than in the past, but the November/December U.S. holiday season is still viewed as a key opportunity to sell consumer electronics.

673,INTC,Russian vanity projects lose lustre,"* U.S. bosses have dropped out of upcoming Russia forum * Chill in Russia-West relations could impact major state projects-analysts * Skolkovo, Moscow financial center, could risk being sidelined-analysts * London City Lord Mayor’s expected June trip to Moscow undecided By Megan Davies SKOLKOVO, Russia, May 22 (Reuters) - Students at Moscow’s new science-focused university crowded into a lecture theatre outside the capital earlier this month to hear Canadian-born Nobel prizewinning molecular biologist Sidney Altman speak. The students at Skoltech are yet to have their own campus because it is still under construction, so the lecture was held at the Moscow School of Management, a long dreary journey from Moscow city centre by metro and then bus up a traffic-clogged road. “By the spring of 2015 we will have some major laboratories working here at Skolkovo in all of our disciplinary areas,” said Skoltech President Edward Crawley, who is leading efforts to develop a university at Skolkovo, Russia’s answer to Silicon Valley, with partners such as U.S. college Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Russian President Vladimir Putin and other officials point to projects like Skolkovo as an example of how Russia is diversifying its economy away from energy. Other projects include Russia’s effort to develop Moscow as an international financial center and to launch a state-backed private equity fund. But at the start of Russia’s annual investment forum in St Petersburg, from May 22-24, the environment for projects such as the Skolkovo tech park is deteriorating. Western sanctions over Ukraine are exacerbating Russia’s economic slowdown and giving foreign investors pause for thought. For decades Russia has failed to deliver on promises to modernise an economy that is focused on extracting and exporting oil, metals and other commodities. The chill in relations with the West following Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula make a difficult task even harder. “All these institutions and initiatives could only work as part of the broader Russian effort to become more integrated with the West,” said Steven Dashevsky, founder of hedge fund Dashevsky & Partners in London. “We’ve seen that movement grind to a halt effectively now.” For Skoltech students, the university is a gateway to the world, offering the chance to do placements with MIT and other colleges. “Even a month at MIT is enough to open your eyes,” said Jelena Nadj, an IT masters student from Serbia speaking at Skolkovo’s Hypercube by the campus construction site, where tractors heave mounds of earth. “You change your attitude.” The collaboration with MIT was launched in 2011. The U.S. university is helping Skoltech to conceive and launch its graduate research university, which now has 63 masters students. MIT said the Ukraine crisis had not affected the alliance. “When diplomatic and political dialog becomes difficult, the importance of educational and academic research collaborations becomes even greater,” said Professor Bruce Tidor, Faculty Lead at MIT Skoltech Initiative, in an emailed statement. That view is echoed by other Skoltech and Skolkovo partners contacted by Reuters. The risk for Russia is that attracting new money becomes difficult, however. The Russian government has pledged 170 billion roubles ($4.9 billion) to Skolkovo, its press office said. The project has also attracted commercial partners including U.S. chip maker Intel, which said Skolkovo remains an important strategic partner. Skoltech’s international partnerships, which alongside MIT include London’s Imperial College, Zurich’s ETH and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, are a major draw for students. “The international experience is one of the biggest achievements of this place,” said Skoltech energy masters student Dmitry Smirnov, from Rybinsk, Russia. “Russia really needs international experience and to build to Europe and the Western world.” Analysts say that Russia’s increasingly difficult relations with the West could result in reduced access to Western technology for projects such as Skolkovo. “The chill between Russia and Western countries will undoubtedly diminish further the viability of the Skolkovo project,” said MIT Professor of the History of Science, Loren Graham. In emailed remarks Graham also identified the typically Russian ‘top-down government-controlled’ nature of the project as an obstacle to progress. “The real problem with Skolkovo is not based on Western connections but with the nature of the enterprise from the beginning,” Graham said. The deterioration of relations with the West has led to predictions that Russia may increase business with Asia or become more isolationist. China and Russia on Wednesday signed a $400-billion gas supply deal, opening up a new market for Moscow as it risks losing European customers. In response to the West’s outcry over Ukraine, Russia has shown it is prepared to go it alone. It plans to set up a credit card payment system to rival Visa and Mastercard  and is threatening to close U.S. GPS satellite navigation system sites. “The worst case is we end up with isolationism and these organisations become sidelined and irrelevant and have a less clear future,” said Chris Weafer, senior partner with Moscow-based Macro-Advisory. “You can get plenty of money in the Middle East and Asia but Russia needs partnerships with established companies with expertise and technology and those are mainly Western companies.” The bulk of foreign funds to state-backed private equity fund the Russian Direct Investment Fund comes from the Middle East and Asia. The U.S. government is asking U.S. firms to steer clear of Russia. Washington has told executives it is inappropriate to visit the St Petersburg forum this week. The event is closely associated with Putin, who usually delivers a keynote speech promoting Russia as a place to invest. One U.S. executive whose firm is involved in major Russian state projects said his company was “caught between a rock and a hard place” and “laying low until the situation becomes clearer.” Several Russian state-backed schemes have international ties. London has partnered in a project aimed at turning Moscow into an international financial centre. An annual trip to Moscow associated with the project and scheduled for June by the Lord Mayor of London is now uncertain to go ahead, said one financial source. The City of London’s press office said no final decision had been made on the trip. “It is a sign of the times that even at this late juncture, clarity is not available,” said the source. TheCityUK, an organisation working on the project, said it would continue to review its activity in the light of “the evolving circumstances in the relationship between the UK and Russia and assess how these might impact on the project.” ($1 = 34.5447 Russian roubles)   (Additional reporting by Marc Jones in Warsaw, Mark Felsenthal in Washington and Polina Devitt and Maria Kiselyova in Moscow; editing by Janet McBride)",5222014,http://www.reuters.com/article/russia-projects/russian-vanity-projects-lose-lustre-idUSL6N0O22X820140522
674,INTC,"UPDATE 1-Apple, Google, Intel, Adobe to pay $325 mln to settle hiring lawsuit","(Adds comment from plaintiffs’ lawyer, details about plaintiffs) By Jonathan Stempel May 23 (Reuters) - Four major Silicon Valley companies have formally agreed to pay $324.5 million to settle claims brought by employees who accused them of limiting competition by colluding not to poach each other’s talent. The settlement, between Apple Inc, Google Inc , Intel Corp, Adobe Systems Inc and roughly 64,000 workers, was disclosed in papers filed late on Thursday with a federal court in San Jose, California. U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh has been asked to preliminarily approve the accord at a June 19 hearing, over an objection by one of the four named plaintiffs, Michael Devine, who says the settlement let the companies off too easily. The payout was originally reported by Reuters but not officially confirmed. Lawyers for the plaintiffs may seek up to 25 percent of the settlement amount in legal fees. Filed in 2011, the lawsuit accused Silicon Valley companies of conspiring to limit competition and keep wages down for engineers, programmers and other technical staff. The case has been closely watched because of the potential $9 billion of damages sought, and its occasional embarrassing revelations into how Silicon Valley operates. Among the communications that became public were pointed emails from Apple co-founder Steve Jobs that at times admonished then-Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt to stop raiding his company. Thursday’s settlement gives workers only a few thousand dollars each on average. The companies’ combined profit in their latest fiscal years was about $60 billion, with three-fifths coming from Apple. In court papers, two law firms representing the plaintiffs said Devine’s objection should not doom what they consider a fair and reasonable settlement for an antitrust case, and which serves the best interests of the class. They pointed to a July 2012 jury verdict in the same court that found Toshiba Corp conspired to fix prices in the liquid crystal display market but awarded just $87 million of damages, one-tenth of what was sought. “The amount of the settlement does not relate to the size or profitability of the companies we sued,” Joseph Saveri, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an interview. “It relates to the claims we made, the law that applies to them, and the facts that we could prove at trial. Based on that, I think the settlement is a significant achievement.” Devine did not immediately respond on Friday to a request for comment. Koh on May 16 approved separate settlements totaling $20 million over alleged poaching by Walt Disney Co’s  Lucasfilm and Pixar units, and by Intuit Inc.

675,INTC,UPDATE 2-Intel to make tablet chips with China's Rockchip,"(Adds comments from analysts, detail on agreement) By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, May 27 (Reuters) - Intel Corp said on Tuesday it reached an agreement with Chinese mobile chipmaker Rockchip to make chips for inexpensive tablets running Google Inc’s Android platform. The deal teams Intel up with a chipmaker specializing in  low-end mobile devices that often cost less than $100 and are popular in China and other fast-growing markets. This represents a major move for the Santa Clara, California company that has struggled to gain traction in smartphones and tablets. The collaboration is unlikely to drastically increase Intel’s overall mobile chip business, but it shows the chipmaker’s determination to be successful in the mobile arena at nearly any cost, said FBR analyst Chris Rolland. “It speaks to (CEO Brian Krzanich) being willing to think somewhat out of the box and be a little more flexible in his approach,” Rolland said. Intel gains access to Rockchip’s ability to quickly launch inexpensive mobile chips as well as access to the company’s strong relationships with local Chinese manufacturers focused on the country’s fast-growing consumer market. “They’re absolutely bringing us speed and execution and proliferation for us that would not otherwise get done,” Krzanich said on a conference call. “They also bring these relationships and partnerships that go well beyond what ours are.” With sales of high-end mobile devices losing steam in North America, manufacturers have been turning their attention to lower-end tablets and smartphones designed for consumers in China. Under the agreement, Rockchip and Intel will make a quad-core mobile chip using Intel’s architecture and branding, Intel said. While Intel excels at developing processors for laptops and desktop computers, it has less experience designing “system on chips,” or SoCs, that combine features like modems, wifi and memory. Fuzhou, China-based Rockchip and other mobile chipmakers focus on making SoCs for smartphones and tablets. Those chips typically include ARM processor technology that competes against Intel’s technology. “It’s to some degree an acknowledgement of Intel’s limited capability in SoCs and very limited presence in China, particularly as you get cheaper and cheaper tablets,” Ascendiant Capital analyst Cody Acree said of the agreement with Rockchip. Intel said the agreement with Rockchip does not include an investment between the two companies. Intel said the chip will include 3G connectivity and be available in the first half of 2015. Shares of Intel were up 1.22 percent at $26.60, in line with trading levels ahead of the announcement.

677,INTC,Intel readies 3D-printed robots for handy consumers,"RANCHO PALOS VERDE California (Reuters) - Intel Corp introduced a walking, talking robot on Wednesday made from 3D-printed parts that will be available to consumers later this year, if they are willing to assemble it with a kit that costs around $1,600. The company’s Chief Executive Brian Krzanich was accompanied by “Jimmy” on stage at the Code Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, California. The white 2-foot tall robot shuffled onto the stage, introduced itself and then waved its arms. Intel describes Jimmy as a research robot, but the company intends to make 3D-printable plans available without charge for a slightly less advanced version, and partners will sell  components that cannot be 3D-printed, such as motors and an Intel Edison processor, in kits.  Jimmy can be programmed to sing, translate languages, send tweets and even serve a cold beer. Under Krzanich, who took over a year ago, the chipmaker is trying to be an early player in emerging technologies like smart clothing, after coming late to the mobile revolution and making little progress in smartphones and tablets.  Its strategy includes engaging tech-savvy do-it-yourselfers and weekend hobbyists working on everything from Internet-connected baby blankets to robots and drones. Owners of the robots will be able to program them to perform unique tasks. They can then share the programs with other owners as downloadable apps. Intel, based in Santa Clara, California, hopes the price for the robot kits will fall below $1,000 within five years. Separately on Wednesday, entrepreneur Bill Gross announced plans for a 3D printer that would sell for $149, far less than devices that now typically sell for $1,000 or more.

679,INTC,Intel: new tablets a big step toward reaching aggressive target,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - New Intel-based tablets from major brands will start hitting store shelves in June, and senior executives at the chipmaker hope the offerings will move it closer to an aggressive sales goal. Far behind rival Qualcomm (QCOM.O) in mobile devices, the upcoming tablets are the result of Intel Corp’s (INTC.O) strategy to sell chips this year at a loss in a bid to stake out badly needed market share. Intel is betting that in the future, its customers will keep using Intel chips without the discounts. Toshiba (6502.T) this week announced six tablets and PCs with detachable screens made with Intel chips, one of which runs the Android operating system and the rest Windows. More Intel-based tablets will start hitting U.S. store shelves in June and July for back-to-school shoppers, Erik Reid, general manager of Intel’s Mobile Client Platforms unit, told Reuters in a recent interview. “It will be a new high-water mark, to be eclipsed by another high-water mark at the holidays,” said Reid, who is managing Intel’s tablet push.  With the PC industry shrinking, mobile devices and other new markets have become a top priority for Intel. Most tablets are made with chips from Samsung (005930.KS), Qualcomm and other companies that use low-power technology from ARM Holdings ARM.L. Earlier in May, CEO Brian Krzanich told Reuters that Intel was well on its way to reaching his goal for the company to increase its sales of tablet chips this year to 40 million units. After shipping 5 million tablet chips in the first quarter, Intel is on track to meet a target of 7.5 million such chips for the June quarter, Krzanich said. “We’re on schedule to hit that number and we’ll see if we can do better than that,” he said. Global tablet shipments from all manufacturers in 2014 will grow 12 percent to 245 million, less than a previous forecast of 261 million devices, because people are keeping their devices longer, market research firm IDC said on Thursday. Intel sold around 10 million tablet chips last year. Manufacturers have launched a handful of Windows tablets running on Intel’s newest Bay Trail chips, but those chips have been slow to appear in devices running the popular Android platform. On Tuesday, Intel announced a deal with Chinese chipmaker Rockchip to make components for entry-level Android devices aimed at local consumers in China.  Partly reflecting the financial incentives Intel is offering manufacturers to use its tablet chips, the company’s mobile and communications group had an operating loss of $929 million in the April quarter on revenue of only $156 million. As well as big PC brands increasingly making tablets, Intel expects small manufacturers making devices for China’s domestic market to play a major part in reaching its 40 million chip goal this year, Reid said.  “We’re confident, but this is by no means saying it’s in the bank.” ",5292014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-intel-tablets/intel-new-tablets-a-big-step-toward-reaching-aggressive-target-idUSKBN0E926820140529

682,INTC,Exclusive: Intel TV creator leaves Verizon months after deal,"SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Erik Huggers is leaving Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) just five months after joining the company via the acquisition of the Intel Corp (INTC.O) “OnCue” streaming service he developed, signaling the communications giant’s waning interest in providing an Internet-delivered TV service. The former BBC executive, who told Reuters on Friday he is departing the company, had worked on OnCue for Intel for more than two years before Verizon bought it in January to accelerate a push into video services, including TV channels delivered over the Internet, known as an “over the top”, or OTT, service. While other companies have been talking up their plans to deliver such a service, a source familiar with the matter said that Verizon was now moving away from the OTT strategy and that the departure of Huggers, who was a proponent of an Internet-only service, reflected that. A Verizon spokesman confirmed Huggers’ departure and in regards to its strategy said, “We obtained a strong combination of technological and personnel assets from Intel Media. We intend to strategically utilize the OnCue technology and talent going forward to grow our business. That has not changed.” Verizon had previously said OnCue would help it offer video over its Fios fiber-optic infrastructure as well.  Seen by some as a bold attempt to revolutionize TV and others as a distraction from Intel’s chip business, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich pulled the plug and put the unit up for sale before it was launched.  Intel’s retreat from streaming TV was a disappointment to people in Silicon Valley who hoped the technology company could break open a market tightly controlled by a handful of cable and entertainment conglomerates. With the acquisition, Huggers and many of his employees moved over to Verizon, where he hoped to launch the service to consumers. But he told Reuters he advised his staff on Thursday that he was leaving the company. Huggers said in an interview he had worked well with his immediate boss at Verizon, Marni Walden, recently appointed to head product development, as well as Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam.  “There were no conflicts at all. The technology is great, the team is great, the future is secure, the dream lives on. It’s time to hand the baby over to someone else,” he said. Verizon’s rivals are working on their own Internet TV services. AT&T; Inc (T.N), which made an offer to buy DirecTV last week in a $45.5 billion deal, has said it would take 12 to 18 months for the combined companies to come up with an over-the-top service.  Dish Network Corp (DISH.O) has said it expects to launch its personalized streaming product by year-end, having already struck a deal for programming from Walt Disney Co (DIS.N).

683,INTC,Intel VP among six Mt. Rainier climbers missing and presumed dead,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - An Intel vice president is among six climbers missing and presumed dead in the worst accident in three decades on Washington’s Mount Rainier, the company said on Monday as search efforts for the group were scaled back. The Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker said Vice President Uday Marty had been among the climbers who likely fell about 3,300 feet (1,000 meters) from the north face of the mountain while they were ascending last week, caught in an avalanche of snow, rock and other debris. “We are in contact with the appropriate authorities and we are providing support in this difficult time to Uday’s wife and other members of his family,” Intel said, describing Marty as an accomplished engineer who was vice president and managing director for Intel South East Asia. Rescue workers previously scaled back the search because of dangerous conditions, and a park spokeswoman said on Monday the operation had begun moving to a “limited continuous search effort” that would rely on aircraft deployed in the area for other tasks to check the site periodically. Mount Rainier National Park spokeswoman Fawn Bauer said there were no plans to deploy ground searchers because of the risk of falling ice and rock. Park officials said previously there was no certainty a recovery was possible given the location. The climbing party, including two guides from Seattle’s Alpine Ascents International, set off last Monday for a five-day trek intended to take them up one of the toughest ascents of the ice-covered 14,100-foot (4,298-metre) massif. They were last heard from via satellite phone on Wednesday evening, when they had reached a height of 12,800 feet (3,900 meters). The identities of the climbers have not been officially released.

688,INTC,Intel loses court challenge against $1.4 billion EU fine,"LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Intel lost on Thursday its challenge against a record 1.06 billion euro ($1.44 billion) European Union fine handed down five years ago, as Europe’s second highest court said regulators did not act too harshly. The European Commission in its 2009 decision said Intel tried to thwart rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) by giving rebates to PC makers Dell, Hewlett-Packard Co, NEC and Lenovo for buying most of their computer chips from Intel.     The EU competition authority said Intel also paid German retail chain Media Saturn Holding to stock only computers with its chips. Judges at the Luxembourg-based General Court said on Thursday they backed the Commission’s decision. “The Commission demonstrated to the requisite legal standard that Intel attempted to conceal the anti-competitive nature of its practices and implemented a long term comprehensive strategy to foreclose AMD from the strategically most important sales channels,” the court said in a near 300-page decision. Judges said the EU watchdog had not been heavy-handed with the level of the fine, equal to 4.15 percent of Intel’s 2008 turnover, versus a possible maximum of 10 percent. While Commission penalties rarely hit the top figure, the rising level of fines is a source of worry for many companies. “The General Court considers that none of the arguments raised by Intel supports the conclusion that the fine imposed is disproportionate. On the contrary, it must be considered that that fine is appropriate in the light of the facts of the case,” judges said.  Intel, which can take its case further to the Court of Justice of the European Union but only on points of law, declined to say whether it would do so. “We are very disappointed about the decision. It’s a complex case which is reflected in the decision. We will begin evaluating the decision,” Intel spokeswoman Sophie Jacobs said. The Commission welcomed the ruling, as did consumers’ lobbying group BEUC.  “When large companies abuse their dominance of the market, it causes direct harm to consumers. The court’s ruling issued a strong reminder that such behaviour is illegal and unacceptable,” said BEUC director-general Monique Goyens. The court’s judgement suggests companies would be better off settling antitrust charges instead of fighting them, said Martina Maier, a partner at law firm McDermott Will & Emery. “Companies under investigation by the Commission should not count on winning in court with the argument that the Commission would not have properly assessed the economic effects of an abuse of dominance,” she said. “This might well lead to a supplementary incentive for a company under investigation for an alleged abuse of dominance to settle with the Commission or to offer commitments in order to motivate the Commission to end its investigation.” Samsung recently settled EU charges while Google has also clinched a deal with the Commission.

The European Commission in its 2009 decision said Intel tried to thwart AMD by giving rebates to PC makers Dell, Hewlett-Packard Co, Japan’s NEC and Lenovo  for buying most of their computer chips from Intel. The EU competition authority said Intel also paid German retail chain Media Saturn Holding to stock only computers with its chips.

700,INTC,Intel raises outlook on stronger PC demand,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) on Thursday raised its outlook for the second quarter and the full year, citing stronger-than-expected demand for personal computers used by businesses. Shares of Intel jumped more than 4 percent in extended trade as the chipmaker’s improved forecast lifted hopes for a PC industry that been shrinking due to consumers’ preferences for tablets and smartphones.  Intel said it now expects second-quarter revenue of $13.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million. Intel had previously forecast revenue of $13 billion, plus or minus $500 million. The chipmaker said it expects “some” revenue growth for the full year, compared with its previous forecast of flat revenue. The Santa Clara, California company also raised the mid-point of its gross margin forecast range for the second quarter, which ends at the end of June, by 1 point to 64 percent. With personal computer shipments falling for eight straight quarters through March, some analysts have suggested the industry’s decline is close to hitting bottom, potentially giving Intel breathing room as it struggles to develop better processors for mobile and wearable devices.     Demand from companies for PCs likely received a boost recently due to Microsoft’s (MSFT.O) winding down of support in April for its Windows XP operating system, analysts say.     “PCs have been getting less bad for a while,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. “But if it’s all business PCs then the question is going to be sustainability.” Intel’s revised revenue and gross margin forecasts for the June quarter could translate to earnings per share of 52 cents, RBC analyst Doug Freedman said in a note to clients.     For the second quarter, analysts on average had expected EPS of 47 cents and revenue of $13.02 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Intel is expected to report its second-quarter results on July 15. Shares of Intel jumped 4.97 percent in extended trade after closing up 0.11 percent at $27.96 on Nasdaq.

703,INTC,Intel woos Internet heavyweights with flexible server chips,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp is taking a new approach to the powerful server chips it sells to Internet heavyweights like Facebook and Google. The Santa Clara, California company is integrating its Xeon processors with programmable chips that will give customers with unique technical requirements more flexibility to optimize their servers. With a stagnant PC industry and little progress in smartphones and tablets, selling high-end server chips is an increasingly important source of profits for Intel. Most servers are made with off-the-shelf Intel Xeon chips, but last year Intel manufactured about 15 customized versions of those processors to meet the particular needs of high-end customers like eBay and Facebook.  It plans to manufacture over 30 customized chips this year, Diane Bryant, who leads Intel’s data center division, told reporters at a briefing this week. The technology Bryant announced at an event Wednesday goes a step further, letting data center operators customize the chips themselves, as often as they want.  Intel dominates the server market but it faces a new source of competition as rivals prepare low-power processors based on technology from ARM Holdings.  The new component integrates a standard Xeon processor and a  chip known as a field-programmable gate array, or FPGA. Customers can configure the chips as needed to make servers faster at handling proprietary tasks, like providing web-search results or updating social networks. “If they have an application that spends a lot of time on a particular algorithm, they can take that algorithm, take the soft (intellectual property), and load it into the FPGA and accelerate that workload,” Bryant said.

704,INTC,Intel woos Internet heavyweights with flexible server chips,"SAN FRANCISCO, June 18 (Reuters) - Intel Corp is taking a new approach to the powerful server chips it sells to Internet heavyweights like Facebook and Google. The Santa Clara, California company is integrating its Xeon processors with programmable chips that will give customers with unique technical requirements more flexibility to optimize their servers. With a stagnant PC industry and little progress in smartphones and tablets, selling high-end server chips is an increasingly important source of profits for Intel. Most servers are made with off-the-shelf Intel Xeon chips, but last year Intel manufactured about 15 customized versions of those processors to meet the particular needs of high-end customers like eBay and Facebook. It plans to manufacture over 30 customized chips this year, Diane Bryant, who leads Intel’s data center division, told reporters at a briefing this week. The technology Bryant announced at an event Wednesday goes a step further, letting data center operators customize the chips themselves, as often as they want. Intel dominates the server market but it faces a new source of competition as rivals prepare low-power processors based on technology from ARM Holdings. The new component integrates a standard Xeon processor and a  chip known as a field-programmable gate array, or FPGA. Customers can configure the chips as needed to make servers faster at handling proprietary tasks, like providing web-search results or updating social networks. “If they have an application that spends a lot of time on a particular algorithm, they can take that algorithm, take the soft (intellectual property), and load it into the FPGA and accelerate that workload,” Bryant said.

707,INTC,Jury in trial of Rajaratnam's brother hears of insider's tips,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former Intel Corp (INTC.O) executive on Tuesday, testifying in the insider trading trial of Rengan Rajaratnam, told jurors how he leaked details of a major deal to the former Galleon Group portfolio manager’s brother, Raj Rajaratnam. The testimony by Rajiv Goel, a former friend of Raj Rajaratnam, marked the first time jurors heard directly from an individual who prosecutors say provided illegal tips to the onetime hedge fund billionaire, who in turn allegedly passed the information to his younger brother. Prosecutors played jurors a series of wiretapped phone conversations between Raj Rajaratnam and Goel, who testified that he spoke frequently with the Galleon founder about a $1 billion investment Intel planned to make in 2008 in technology company Clearwire Corp.  “The whole investment was confidential,” Goel said. Prosecutors accuse Rengan Rajaratnam, 43, of conspiring with his brother to trade on inside information about Clearwire and Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.N in 2008. He faces three counts of conspiracy and securities fraud.  Raj Rajaratnam, 57, is serving an 11-year prison term after being convicted of securities fraud and conspiracy. On cross-examination, Goel said he had never met Rengan Rajaratnam until a vacation in Italy arranged with Raj Rajaratnam following the deal. Goel said he believed he was “manipulated” by Raj Rajaratnam to provide inside information and had hoped he would not pass the tips along to anyone else. “I did not expect him to,” Goel said. “We were friends.” Goel previously testified against Raj Rajaratnam, whom he met while attending the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Goel pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the insider trading scheme and was sentenced in 2012 to two years of probation. On Tuesday, he said he provided Raj Rajaratnam tips about Intel starting in 2007, first about a quarterly earnings report and then later about the 2008 deal with Clearwire. In a March 20, 2008, taped phone call played in court, Goel asked Raj Rajaratnam, “So, did you, uh ... digest the information I gave you?” The two then discuss details about the not-yet-announced deal, including how much money Intel was investing, the value of a newly created entity, other companies involved in the transaction and board members of the new company. For several years before that, Raj Rajaratnam helped Goel financially, earning his friend $700,000 to $800,000 trading in his personal account at his request. Raj Rajaratnam also lent him $100,000 in 2005 in connection with a home purchase and gave him $500,000 to help keep a family property in Bombay. But on cross-examination, Goel acknowledged that he never told Rengan Rajaratnam about any of the personal benefits he received. Rengan Rajaratnam’s attorney, Daniel Gitner, has argued that prosecutors must prove his client knew of any personal benefits received by tippers in exchange for disclosing confidential information.

717,INTC,Intel says worst is over for battered PC industry,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) believes the worst is over for a personal computer industry hammered by the mobile revolution. The Santa Clara, California chipmaker forecast third-quarter revenue above Wall Street’s expectations on Tuesday, sending its stock 4 percent higher in extended trade.  Investors have pushed shares of PC mainstays Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Intel to decade-highs, partly on bets that the global slump in PC demand that began with Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) launch of the iPad four years ago is hitting bottom.   “PCs have stabilized,” Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told Reuters after Intel’s report. He said he expects shrinking demand from consumers in China and other developing countries to rebound, just as it recently has in the United States.  From the end of 2010, the year the iPad was launched, to the end of 2013, annual global PC shipments shrank a total of 12 percent, according to IDC. Intel now expects the market’s recovery to help it grow its full-year revenue about 5 percent, slightly higher than prior expectations. Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich told analysts on a conference call that improved demand from companies replacing old PCs would last at least through the end of 2014. Also on Tuesday, Intel increased its share buyback program by $20 billion. It plans to repurchase about $4 billion of stock in the current quarter, underscoring its confidence in a turnaround and a growing crop of “two in one” devices with detachable keyboards and screens. “My presumption would be that if they’re confident enough to boost it that they see this (PC market) upside maintaining,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said. “God help them if they’re wrong.”  Intel said in a statement it expects third-quarter revenue of $14.4 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts had expected $14 billion on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.     Revenue from Intel’s PC group rose 6 percent in the quarter while its data center group, a big contributor to gross margins, had revenue jump 19 percent. Intel has made little progress expanding from the PC industry into chips for smartphones and tablets. For the second quarter, Intel said its mobile and communications group’s revenue fell 83 percent to $51 million and had an operating loss of $1.12 billion.

China’s economy expanded by 2.0 percent in the second quarter from the previous quarter, taking annual growth to 7.5 percent. Retail sales and industrial output were either in line with forecasts or slightly higher. The data confirmed the Asian giant had stabilised after a shaky start to the year but still left the global outlook cloudy, particularly given recent weakness in the euro zone. “The GDP figure is in line with our expectation, but the underlying momentum and recovery is still at a fragile state, especially given the property market correction,” said Chang Jian, an analyst at Barclays based in Hong Kong. “The recovery is quite dependent on the government support.” MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan  was down 0.2 percent while Japan’s Nikkei  eased 0.1 percent. Markets in China managed only a muted cheer and the Shanghai index dipped 0.29 percent. European investors seemed more impressed, with financial spreadbetters expecting the FTSE 100, DAX and CAC 40 to open 0.2 percent to 0.3 percent firmer. Wall Street had provided scant direction after investors gave a muddled reaction to testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. Yellen reiterated that the U.S. labour market was far from healthy and signalled the Fed would keep monetary policy loose until hiring and wage data show the effects of the financial crisis are “completely gone”. Yet bond investors fixed on a comment that rates could rise more quickly should the labour market continue to improve at a rapid pace, and drove up short-term Treasury yields. The latest U.S. economic news was generally upbeat as a solid rise in core retail sales in June combining with upward revisions to past months led analysts to nudge up estimates for economic growth in the second quarter. The Dow ended up a bare 0.03 percent, while the S&P; 500 lost 0.19 percent and the Nasdaq 0.54 percent. High-flying social media and biotechnology shares took a hit after the Fed singled out the valuation of the sector as “substantially stretched.” But there was some brighter news for the tech sector as chipmaker Intel jumped more than 4 percent after beating estimates. <ID:nL2N0PQ2A3> JPMorgan Chase & Co and Goldman Sachs  outperformed after reporting strong results. JPMorgan finished up 3.5 percent and was the biggest gainer on the Dow. The contrast to Europe was stark as banking shares were sideswiped when Portugal’s Banco Espirito Santo slumped 17.5 percent to a fresh record low. The euro took collateral damage and fell to its lowest in a month at $1.3555. The single currency also took a mauling from the pound, which jumped when UK inflation surprised with a high reading, stoking speculation for interest rates to rise this year. Attention now is on UK unemployment figures due later Wednesday where a strong report could lift the pound further. The euro sank to a two-year trough at 79.08 pence, while sterling made a six-year peak on the dollar at $1.7191 . The U.S. currency still managed to gain elsewhere and its index edged up to a three-week high at 80.453. A big mover in Asia was the New Zealand dollar, which slid to $0.8700 after the country reported softer-than-expected inflation. In commodity markets, gold fell back to $1,298.50 an ounce and further away from last week’s peak at $1,345. Oil prices managed a small bounce on Wednesday having struck a three-month trough the day before. Prices have been falling for three weeks now as traders shift their focus from violence in Iraq and Libya to weak global fundamentals. Brent futures edged up 8 cents to $106.10 a barrel, having shed over a dollar on Tuesday. U.S. crude futures  recouped 46 cents to stand at $100.42 a barrel.

732,INTC,Applied Micro ships microserver chips in challenge to Intel,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Applied Micro Circuits has begun shipping a new kind of low-power server chip that might challenge heavyweight Intel in cutting-edge data centers. The Sunnyvale, California, company disappointed Wall Street on Tuesday with first fiscal quarter revenue and second-quarter revenue outlook that missed expectations due to a declining legacy business, sending its shares 4 percent lower after hours.  But Applied Micro Circuits also announced it is shipping its new X-Gene “microserver” chips, made with intellectual property licensed from ARM Holdings, whose low-power technology is widely used in smartphones.  In the quarter that ended in June, Applied Micro Circuits recognized its first revenue from the chips - about a $1 million - and the company said it expects “meaningful” revenue from the chips in the quarters ending in December and March as shipments build.  “There is backlog today on the books for X-Gene, both in the September quarter and December quarter, as well as the March quarter,” Chief Executive Officer Paramesh Gopi told analysts on a conference call.  While microservers have yet to be meaningfully adopted, proponents say data centers can be made more cost effective and energy efficient by using them instead of Intel’s brawny server chips. Intel dominates the server market and it stands to lose if server chips based on a rival architecture catch on, even if only a few percentage points of market share.   “While we don’t take any competition lightly, the much-hyped threat of ARM servers getting any significant market segment share any time soon has been vastly overplayed,” said Intel spokesman Bill Calder.

735,INTC,"UPDATE 3-Judge rejects $324.5 mln settlement over Apple, Google hiring","(Adds Intel comment, more details from ruling) By Dan Levine SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Four Silicon Valley companies including Apple and Google failed to persuade a U.S. judge to sign off on a $324.5 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit by tech workers, who accused the firms of conspiring to avoid poaching each other’s employees. In a ruling on Friday, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, said the class action settlement was too low, given the strength of the case against the companies. Intel  and Adobe were also part of the proposed deal. There is “substantial and compelling evidence” that late Apple Inc co-founder Steve Jobs “was a, if not the, central figure in the alleged conspiracy,” Koh wrote. The judge provided details in evidence of anecdotes involving Jobs and other Valley executives to show why she thought the workers deserved more. Representatives for Apple and Google Inc declined to comment. Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said the company is disappointed Koh rejected an agreement “that was negotiated at arm’s length over many months,” but appreciates that Koh provided additional information on her views. Lawyers for the workers, along with an Adobe representative, were not immediately available to comment. In their 2011 lawsuit, the tech employees said the conspiracy had limited their job mobility and, as a result, kept a lid on salaries. The case has been closely watched because of the possibility of big damages being awarded and for the opportunity to peek into the world of some of America’s elite tech firms. The case was based largely on emails in which Apple’s Jobs, former Google Chief Executive Officer Eric Schmidt and some of their rivals hatched plans to avoid poaching each other’s prized engineers. Koh referred to one email exchange which occurred after a Google recruiter solicited an Apple employee. Schmidt told Jobs that the recruiter would be fired. Jobs then forwarded Schmidt’s note to a top Apple human resources executive with a smiley face. Koh also disclosed a 2006 exchange over Google’s plans to open an engineering center in Paris. Google sought to hire three former Apple engineers for the project, but Jobs objected. Jobs wrote that his company would “strongly prefer that you not hire these guys.” Google then told Jobs it had scrapped plans for the Paris center, “based on your strong preference.” The four companies agreed to settle with the workers in April shortly before trial. The plaintiffs had planned to ask for about $3 billion in damages at trial, which could have tripled to $9 billion under antitrust law. Plaintiff attorneys argued Koh should approve the deal because the workers faced serious risks on appeal had the case gone forward. Some tech workers filed objections to the settlement, however, saying both sides should go back to the negotiating table in the hopes of obtaining a larger amount. Daniel Girard, a lawyer for one of the objectors, said he is “very pleased that the court agreed with his position.” It is unclear whether objectors would be included in any future settlement negotiations. In her ruling, Koh repeatedly referred to a related settlement last year involving Disney and Intuit. Apple and Google workers got proportionally less in the latest deal compared to the one involving Disney, Koh wrote, even though plaintiff lawyers have “much more leverage” now than they did a year ago. To match the earlier settlement, the latest deal “would need to total at least $380 million,” Koh wrote. The judge also said the plaintiffs had strong evidence to prove how the no-poaching deals impacted wages. In response to hiring pressure from Facebook, Google co-founder Sergey Brin announced a policy in 2007 of making counteroffers “within one hour” to any Google employee approached by the social networking company. Google then tried to entice Facebook into a no-poaching deal, Koh wrote, but Facebook refused. The Facebook threat eventually led Google to alter its salary structure and increase all salaries by 10 percent, Koh wrote. A further hearing in the case is scheduled for Sept. 10.

738,INTC,Intel explores wearable devices for Parkinson's disease research,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp plans to use wearable gadgets such as smart watches to monitor patients with Parkinson’s disease and collect data that can be shared with researchers. On Wednesday, the chip maker said it is teaming up with the Michael J. Fox Foundation, established by the actor and Parkinson’s sufferer in 2000, to conduct a multi-phase research study of the neurodegenerative brain disease. An estimated five million people globally have been diagnosed with Parkinson’s, the second-most-common neurudegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s.  The initial goal is to determine the feasibility of using wearable devices to monitor patients remotely and store that data in an open system that can be accessed by scientists.  In the next phase of the study, which will likely kick off in the fall, the foundation will set aside funds to explore how patients are responding to medication. Participants will be monitored via an array of wearable devices.  “As more of these devices hit the market, we can collect objective measurements and determine the efficacy of new therapeutics,” Sohini Chowdhury, a senior vice president for research partnerships at the foundation, told Reuters.  Clinical trials have been far too “subjective” in the past, she said. For instance, a patient might inform her doctor that she felt a tremor for several minutes, when it actually lasted a matter of seconds. In the future, Chowdhury hopes patients and their doctors will have more precise measurements via wearable devices about the “frequency and severity” of symptoms.  Chowdhury said the foundation will continue to raise funding to cover the costs of providing wearable devices to patients. By using such devices, the foundation and other research groups can tap into a broader pool of patients for clinical trials, Chowdhury said. Today, many people with Parkinson’s disease are unable to participate in clinical trials because they do not live near a research facility. But wearable devices offer a convenient way to track patients from their work or homes, allowing people in the most rural parts of the country to participate.  As it expands beyond the PC arena, Intel hopes to capture a share of the growing market for big data analytics and wearable devices in the health sector. Ron Kasabian, general manager of Intel’s Big Data Solutions group, said the data center and “Internet of Things” business units are exploring the sector.  “We’re exploring how to pull data out of devices in real-time,” he said. “We can mine data to improve research, and better understand the behaviors and progression of the disease.”  While Intel boasts its own wearable technologies, Kasabian stressed that the Parkinson’s study is device agnostic, meaning patients can test a variety of wearable gadgets. In March, Intel completed its acquisition of Basis Science, a startup that is best known for its wrist-band that measures the wearer’s heart rate.  Intel expects to extend similar programs to related areas of health care, as well as other industries, including manufacturing.

740,INTC,Exclusive: Intel hires senior Qualcomm exec to boost mobile business,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) has hired Amir Faintuch, a senior executive at rival Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), to step up efforts in mobile and Internet-connected gadgets. Hiring a senior executive from a major competitor is rare for Intel, which is known in Silicon Valley for its insular culture, and it reflects the eagerness of the Santa Clara, California, chipmaker to improve its struggling mobile business. Faintuch, who previously oversaw Qualcomm’s networking and connectivity businesses as president of Qualcomm Atheros, is joining Intel as a senior vice president and co-general manager of the Platform Engineering Group, Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said on Friday.  He will be among Intel’s dozen or so most senior executives and will co-manage the Platform Engineering Group with Josh Walden, a manufacturing technology expert who previously led the group. Mulloy told Reuters that in addition to strong network skills, Faintuch brings experience designing “system on chips,” or SoCs, which combine features like modems, Wi-Fi and memory.  While Intel excels at developing processors for laptops and desktop computers, it has less experience designing SoCs, which are widely used in smartphones and tablets. “We want to accelerate our success rate with SoCs and get the designs aligned and the roadmaps aligned to do that,” Mulloy said. “We’ve made good progress but there’s more to be done. Amir has extensive management experience and a strong resume.” A Qualcomm spokesman had no comment beyond confirming Faintuch’s departure. Bringing in Faintuch, which was announced in an email to Intel employees on Friday, is the latest move by the company to accelerate progress in mobile gadgets, where it trails Qualcomm. Since taking over in 2013, CEO Brian Krzanich has made a number of sweeping changes designed to counteract a slump in PC sales, including opening Intel’s cutting-edge factories to other chipmakers willing to pay for access to them. In May, Intel reached an agreement with Chinese SoC specialist Rockchip to make chips for inexpensive tablets running Google Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Android platform. As Intel struggles with declining PC sales and slow progress in mobile, Qualcomm, whose smartphone chips lead the industry, has been viewed by many engineers in recent years as a potentially more attractive place to work.  In 2012, senior executive Anand Chandrasekher, a 25-year Intel veteran, jumped over to Qualcomm to become the San Diego company’s chief marketing officer.

743,INTC,Intel's CEO says its costly tablet chip strategy has paid off,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp’s (INTC.O) plan this year to pay manufacturers to use its processors to make tablets was boosting the chipmaker’s market share, Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich said on Tuesday, adding that he hoped to avoid such a costly strategy with smartphones. After falling behind rival chipmakers in mobile in recent years, Krzanich set a goal for Intel’s chips to be used in 40 million tablets in 2014, up from 10 million the previous year. To reach it, Intel is paying manufacturers some of the initial engineering cost of developing tablets using its chips, hoping those companies will continue to use them for future devices. The vast majority of tablets are made with processors based on rival technology from Britain’s ARM Holdings Plc ARM.L. “We’ve made good progress getting into tablets,” Krzanich told reporters ahead of the annual Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco. “We’ve gone from nothing to something where I consider us a real tablet manufacturer.” Investors have pushed shares of Intel to decade highs, partly on bets that the global slump in personal computer demand that began with Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) introduction of the iPad four years ago is hitting bottom. Shares of Intel have surged about 35 percent so far this year, far more than the Standard & Poor’s 500’s increase of 8 percent.  Intel would not say how much it was spending to coax tablet makers into using its chips. But reflecting an ongoing struggle to break into smartphones and tablets, the company’s mobile and communications group’s second-quarter revenue fell 83 percent to $51 million, and the unit had an operating loss of $1.12 billion. Krzanich said he hoped to avoid using costly subsidies when he sets a new goal for smartphone chip shipments for 2015. Intel’s upcoming Sofia smartphone chip includes a 3G version for low-cost devices in developing countries like China as well as a version with 4G for the United States. “It’s a product built for the right price point,” Krzanich said. At Tuesday’s event, Intel was expected to highlight its determination to become a player in a growing wave of wearable computing gadgets like smart watches and fitness trackers. Intel has been working with design company Opening Ceremony to launch a fashion bracelet with semiprecious gems, communications features and wireless charging.

Shares of Intel have surged about 35 percent so far this year, far more than the Standard & Poor’s 500’s increase of 8 percent. Intel would not say how much it was spending to coax tablet makers into using its chips. But reflecting an ongoing struggle to break into smartphones and tablets, the company’s mobile and communications group’s second-quarter revenue fell 83 percent to $51 million, and the unit had an operating loss of $1.12 billion. Krzanich said he hoped to avoid using costly subsidies when he sets a new goal for smartphone chip shipments for 2015. Intel’s upcoming Sofia smartphone chip includes a 3G version for low-cost devices in developing countries like China as well as a version with 4G for the United States. “It’s a product built for the right price point,” Krzanich said. At Tuesday’s event, Intel was expected to highlight its determination to become a player in a growing wave of wearable computing gadgets like smart watches and fitness trackers. Intel has been working with design company Opening Ceremony to launch a fashion bracelet with semiprecious gems, communications features and wireless charging. In March, Intel bought fitness bracelet maker Basis Science. Last week it announced plans to work with fashion accessory retailer Fossil Group to develop more wearable computing devices.

745,INTC,"Tech, equipment makers join U.S. 'net neutrality' debate","LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Regulating internet providers more like public utility companies could hurt the Internet and the U.S. economy, more than two dozen network technology and equipment makers have told U.S. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker. Thirty-three companies including Cisco Systems Inc, Intel Corp and International Business Machines Corp joined the chorus of citizens, activists, lawmakers and companies debating how the U.S. government should regulate Internet service providers (ISPs). Other companies signing a letter to Pritzker published on Tuesday included Alcatel Lucent SA, Ericsson, Nokia Oyj’s network arm NSN, Panasonic Corp of North America and CommScope Holding Co Inc. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is considering so-called “net neutrality” rules that would determine how ISPs such as Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc manage web traffic on their networks. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has proposed rules that would allow ISPs to charge content companies to ensure their websites or applications load smoothly and quickly, as long as such deals are deemed “commercially reasonable.”  Critics, including popular video streaming service Netflix Corp and numerous advocacy groups, argue the plan would threaten less deep-pocketed content providers by potentially relegating them to “slow lanes” on the web. Instead, they call on the FCC to reclassify broadband as a telecommunication service rather than the less-regulated information service it is now, saying the move would give more power to the FCC to stop potential violators of net neutrality. ISPs and Republicans, both in Congress and at the FCC, have rejected the idea.  On Tuesday, 33 telecom network and tech makers, who are members of the Telecommunications Industry Association and the National Cable and Telecommunications Association and who depend on ISPs for business, spoke out against the reclassification idea as well. “A sudden shift from the existing light-touch approach – which has been an unqualified success and the basis for billions of dollars in investments – to the prescriptive regime of Title II would be extremely disruptive to the broadband marketplace,” they wrote, referring to the legal authority the FCC would use to reclassify ISPs. Experts have disagreed on whether or how reclassification would adequately prevent pay-for-priority deals.  Wheeler has not proposed reclassification as the solution, but has not taken it off the table as a potential option. FCC is collecting public comment on the tentatively proposed rules until Sept. 15 and will hold several public workshops on various aspects of the regulations in the following weeks. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy will hold a hearing on the issue of net neutrality on Sept. 17.

746,INTC,"For U.S. tech firms, China entices in spite of tight state control","TIANJIN, CHINA Sept 12 (Reuters) - The sheer size of the Chinese market is so alluring to Western companies that even pro-internet freedom firms like CloudFlare may have to put moral outrage to the side in their pursuit of new business. San Francisco-based CloudFlare has a policy of providing cyber-defence services for all, based on a belief that the internet should be free, decentralised and open. Its clients have included groups that the U.S. government regards as terrorist organisations. Those values may now have to be shelved when it comes to entering China, where state control of the internet is among the world’s tightest. CloudFlare is looking for a Chinese partner and aims to be in the country by 2015, said co-founder Michelle Zatlyn on the sidelines of a World Economic Forum meeting in the northern city of Tianjin this week. “As we think about international expansion it’s vital that we get China,” said Zatlyn of CloudFlare’s second-largest market by user traffic. “There are rules and regulation which operate within the country. As a U.S. company we absolutely have to follow those, and we’re okay with that.” The operating environment in China may be even tougher now. U.S. businesses have complained about Chinese protectionism, and American tech firms have repeatedly come under fire from the state since last year’s U.S. National Security Agency cyber espionage revelations. Microsoft Corp and Qualcomm Inc are being investigated for anti-trust violations, while IBM Corp, Intel Corp and Cisco Systems Inc have seen sales in China plummet in recent quarters. CloudFlare is joining a long list of companies, from firms that have seen little or no success in China like Yahoo Inc , eBay Inc, Google Inc and Facebook Inc  to recent entrants like LinkedIn Corp, for whom China’s pull as the world’s largest internet market by population has been too strong to resist. CloudFlare is hoping to learn from the lessons of the U.S. tech sector’s fallen soldiers in China. One of these came at the World Economic Forum, where Lu Wei, the director of China’s State Internet Information Office, said Facebook will be unable to access China any time soon, according to state media. “You have to play a slightly long game if you’re a Western multi-national company in China,” said Mark Spelman, a managing director at Accenture PLC. “It’s very important to think about which Chinese partners you should be working with, and organisations need to think very  carefully about what business model you need in China - it might not be the same as in other countries,” he cautioned.

747,INTC,Israel approves Intel's $6 billion investment in chip plant,"TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Israel’s finance and economy ministries on Monday approved a plan by Intel Corp to invest $6 billion in the upgrade of its chip manufacturing plant, in what would be the largest single investment by a foreign company in the country. Intel will receive a government grant of $300 million over five years and will be eligible to pay a corporate tax rate of only 5 percent for a 10-year period, the ministries said. The U.S. chip giant plans to hire close to 1,000 more workers at the plant in the southern town of Kiryat Gat by 2023, in addition to the 2,500 that already work there. “Intel’s investment is a strategic asset for Israel’s industry,” Finance Minister Yair Lapid said in a statement. “This is the biggest investment by a foreign company ever in Israel and is further proof that Israel is at the forefront of technology and innovation.” Intel submitted the investment plan in May and it is widely believed to be aimed at shifting to new 10 nanometer technology. The finance ministry said the plant would be the most advanced chip facility in the world. A company spokesman declined to comment. Intel had said January that it would decide on the location of a 10 nanometer plant this year. Israel was one of a number of countries competing to host the new plant.  Intel Israel’s exports, mainly from its Fab 28 plant in Kiryat Gat, amounted to $3.8 billion in 2013, down from $4.6 billion the year before. In its 40 years in Israel, Intel has invested $10.8 billion in plants and development centers and received $1.5 billion in grants. It employs nearly 10,000 people in the Jewish state.

More recently he has struck partnerships in the fashion world with companies such as Fossil Group and Opening Ceremony to design stylish smart clothing. “Intel’s new CEO has proven to be willing to take on new partnerships and approach new business opportunities that stray from prior conventions,” said Suji Da Silva, an analyst at Topeka Capital Markets, before the announcement. “They should do as much of this as they need to be in markets that are important to them.” While Intel excels at developing processors for laptops and desktop computers, it has less experience designing “system on chips” or SoCs, the key processors on mobile devices, which combine features such as modems, WiFi and memory. The company’s stock has risen 32 percent this year, in part because of stabilisation of demand for personal computers. With demand for smartphones cooling in the United States, manufacturers have increased their focus to China, where demand is strong for handsets priced under $150. Spreadtrum is one of several chipmakers that specialise in turnkey smartphone platforms that are easy for manufacturers to use.

758,INTC,HP sees low-power servers making inroads in niche data centers,"SAN JOSE California (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co’s vice president of server engineering expects new lower-power servers made with technology from ARM Holdings to make inroads in niche data centers over the next year in a market dominated by Intel Corp. “Penetration is very low right now because we’re starting from zero. But the take-up is pretty encouraging,” Tom Bradicich said. HP this week launched new servers made with chips designed by Applied Micro Circuits with intellectual property licensed from ARM, whose energy-efficient technology is ubiquitous in smartphones and tablets. While so-called microservers have yet to be meaningfully adopted, proponents including HP say some data centers can be made more cost effective and energy efficient by using them instead of Intel’s brawny server chips. Bradicich told Reuters that HP’s new 64-bit ARM-based servers are ideal for handling specialized data-center workloads like search and scientific analysis. Sandia National Laboratories and the University of Utah plan to use HP’s new servers for scientific analysis and high-performance computing, while PayPal plans to use another version of the servers.  Intel, which dominates the server market, stands to lose if server chips based on rival ARM’s architecture catch on, even if only a few percentage points of market share. With Advanced Micro Devices and other chipmakers working on their own ARM server chips, variety is a key factor for customers that have long depended on Intel, Bradicich said. In response to the threat from ARM, Intel has launched its own line of “Atom” low-power server chips. HP offers servers made with Atom chips but they have so far not sold in significant numbers. “We don’t take any competition lightly, but we have a strong roadmap for the data center spanning a broad range of customer needs and requirements,” said Intel spokesman Bill Calder.

764,INTC,UPDATE 1-Wall St Week Ahead-Investors gird for scarier days in markets,"(Updates with closing levels, adds details) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Volatility has suddenly returned to U.S. stocks, and for the first time all year it doesn’t appear that the weakness in equities will go away quietly in the span of a few days. While the S&P; 500 is still up 3.1 percent for the year, the index is off about 5 percent from its record high reached in mid-September, and closed out this week at the lowest level since May 23. “We’re still in a bull market, but in the near term things are a little bit dicey, and I don’t think the decline is over with yet,” said Jeffrey Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James Financial in St. Petersburg, Florida. The S&P; 500 and Nasdaq posted their biggest weekly declines since May 2012, and the Dow Jones industrial average ended Friday in negative territory for the year. The S&P; also posted back-to-back intraday moves of more than 40 points this week for the first time in three years. Wall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, ended at 21.24 on Friday, its highest level since early February. Investors said they were concerned about the eventual end of Federal Reserve stimulus, as well as weak growth overseas and its potential effect on U.S. earnings. The slide in oil prices has also served as a harbinger for poor demand, and investors in general got caught betting heavily on further market gains at a time when this stew boiled over. The volatility recalls the last major period of big market gyrations in the second half of 2011, when the first-ever credit downgrade of the United States and the threat of a debt default kept investors on their toes for several months. It is unclear whether the current turmoil will last as long. “What is interesting about what is going on is that you have several themes all feeding into the same action, and that action is to mitigate risk,” said Peter Kenny, chief market strategist of Clearpool Group in New York. The only S&P; 500 sectors to gain since the market’s Sept. 18 high are defensive - utilities and consumer staples. This week also saw the biggest weekly inflow on record to U.S. taxable bond funds, while nearly $7 billion left stock funds. One sign that investors anticipate more volatility has been in the options market, where volumes have increased sharply.  Friday marked the busiest day in the options market since June 2013, with options volume totaling 27.2 million contracts, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert. In addition, the CBOE Volatility Index is trading higher than monthly VIX futures contracts between now and May 2015, a sign of worry about near-term ups and downs in the market. “Just look at options volume versus stocks volume over the past three to six months,” said Tim Biggam, lead option strategist at online brokerage TradingBlock. “Options volume has been nothing but growing and stock volume has been sort of petering out. A lot of the big players are pre-positioning with options.” Growing worry over Europe and other overseas economies has money managers concerned about earnings season. The next two weeks bring a slew of U.S. corporate results, including from S&P; 500 companies with some of the highest levels of sales abroad, such as chip maker Intel Corp. A disappointing outlook from Microchip Technology  late Thursday has put a negative spin on the chip sector’s outlook. The PHLX semiconductor index saw its largest daily percentage decline since January 2009, ending down 6.9 percent on Friday. It lost as much as 15 percent since hitting a 13-year high less than a month ago. Should U.S. results prove strong, however, it may stem the recent selling. “The earnings reports from the U.S. should help put a bottom in the market and lead to some regained strength. We think we remain in good shape,” said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Chicago-based Northern Trust Asset Management, which has about $924 billion in assets.

765,INTC,Intel gains a new ally in China's chip wars: Beijing,"BEIJING/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel’s investment of up to $1.5 billion in two fast-growing Chinese mobile chipmakers has effectively aligned the U.S. giant with a third party - a Beijing government intent on producing a viable domestic challenger to the likes of Qualcomm and Samsung. For more than a decade, China has targeted semiconductor design and manufacture as a major focus of its industrial policy. Activity has picked up markedly over the past year with a spate of cross-border mergers and cooperation deals. “We’ve entered an inflection point where government policy has started to work - it’s started to help the local semiconductor industry,” said Nomura analyst Leping Huang. The deal hashed out by Intel Corp Chief Executive Brian Krzanich over 24 hours in Beijing in early August extends Intel’s beachhead in China, the biggest battleground in the smartphone industry, and boosts the company’s years-long effort to catch up to leading mobile chipmaker Qualcomm Inc. A key visit during the trip was to Yang Xueshan, the deputy chief of China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), who gave his blessing for the deal. The agreement, unveiled on Sept. 26, gives Intel a 20 percent stake in Spreadtrum Communications and RDA Microelectronics through shares in a Tsinghua University holding company, with the aim of jointly developing and marketing smartphone chips. China is the world’s largest consumer and manufacturer of smartphones yet relies heavily on imported chips - particularly the processors that power the latest devices - made by San Diego-based Qualcomm, South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co, or MediaTek Inc of Taiwan. China’s ramped-up activity also arrives on the heels of revelations about the U.S. surveillance program PRISM, which has prompted Beijing to undertake a slew of actions to enhance the security of its information technology industry. For Intel, the world’s leading manufacturer of chips for personal computers, the Tsinghua deal offers an additional path into the world’s biggest chip market after it was slow to recognize the mobile revolution and design new processors for smartphones and tablets.  Intel spokesman John Mandeville declined to comment. The China Semiconductor Industry Association estimates that revenue from China’s chip industry reached 251 billion yuan($40.98 billion) in 2013, while domestic demand for chips amounted to 917 billion yuan, representing more than half of global semiconductor consumption. Deng Zhonghan, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and National People’s Congress, said in March that China’s $210 billion worth of annual chip imports exceeds the value of the country’s entire yearly petroleum imports. In June, the State Council offered the country’s most comprehensive guidelines for the development of the semiconductor industry, outlining specific revenue targets for 2015 and 2020, with chip revenue set to grow at a better-than 20 percent annual clip, to reach 350 billion yuan by 2020. An important part of Beijing’s effort, analysts and industry insiders say, was consolidation of Spreadtrum and RDA, two companies formerly trading independently on Nasdaq. The two companies were acquired a year ago for $1.7 billion and $900 million respectively by Tsinghua Unigroup, government-affiliated private equity group controlled by Tsinghua University in Beijing. As part of its recent deal, which is expected to close early next year, Intel and Unigroup will form a new holding company that contains Spreadtrum and RDA. Beijing wants the Unigroup companies to become competitive with Taiwan’s MediaTek within five years and overtake Qualcomm within 10 years, according to a person familiar with Unigroup. Since taking over in 2013, Krzanich has aggressively positioned Intel to catch up with Qualcomm, the leading mobile chipset maker. A central part of that strategy is China, where consumers are snapping up low-end smartphones made with low-cost chips from local suppliers like Spreadtrum and MediaTek. Intel started investing in local operations 20 years ago, and presently operates factories across the country for manufacturing, assembling and testing microprocessors. Intel also has research and development operations in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen.  In May, Intel said it reached an agreement with Fuzhou-based Rockchip to produce chips for tablets based on Intel’s architecture. “With China, what they want is for you to be a true partner,” Krzanich told reporters in September. “We go in and we partner, we build factories, we build R&D; and we help local companies.” Intel’s deal with Tsinghua Unigroup comes three months after Qualcomm agreed to partner with Shanghai-based Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), China’s largest foundry, to produce some of Qualcomm’s smartphone chips. As part of the agreement, Qualcomm will help SMIC implement its first high-end 28 nanometer manufacturing technology. It also coincides with a year-long Chinese anti-monopoly investigation into Qualcomm. Critics say the probe unfairly targets foreign companies in order to help domestic companies, which Chinese authorities flatly deny. Krzanich first discussed ways to collaborate with the Chinese firms during a visit to Tsinghua University in April, where he and Intel China head Yang Xu met Tsinghua Holding’s Xu Jinhong, Unigroup’s Zhou Weiguo, Spreadtrum founder Li Liyou, who is also a Tsinghua University alumnus. He made a second trip to Beijing, the whirlwind visit in August, after which the deal fell into place. “Tsinghua University is an important driving force for the development of national science and technology, and Tsinghua Holdings is a key part of that effort,” Tsinghua Holdings Chief Executive Xu Jinhong told Reuters by email. Xu characterized the Intel investment as “a new model for cooperation between Chinese and U.S. companies in the chip industry.” Analysts say that Intel’s deal will give the Santa Clara-based company a moderate boost by gaining a partner with strong relationships with local phone manufacturers. The deal should also give Intel enough protection of its intellectual property through licensing arrangements and other conditions, said Scott Kennedy, director of the Research Centre for Chinese Politics and Business at Indiana University. “There’s potential benefits for everyone,” Kennedy said.

768,INTC,"UPDATE 1-Tech workers ask appeals court to reject Apple, Google bid","(Adds Intel and Apple declined to comment, additional background) By Dan Levine SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Employees suing Apple , Google and two other tech companies over hiring practices said an appeals court should not approve a $324.5 million settlement in the case, according to a court filing on Tuesday. Plaintiff workers accused Apple, Google, Intel and Adobe in a 2011 lawsuit of conspiring to avoid poaching each other’s employees. The companies agreed to a $324.5 million settlement earlier this year. U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California then rejected the proposed class action settlement, saying the amount was too low. The companies appealed last month, saying she committed “clear legal error.” In the filing on Tuesday, the workers said that although they believed the $324.5 million deal originally warranted approval, the judge had the proper authority to reject it and they would “defer to (Koh’s) sound judgment about how best to oversee this litigation.” An Intel spokesman declined to comment, as did an Apple spokeswoman. Representatives for Google and Adobe could not immediately be reached. Tech employees alleged that the conspiracy limited their job mobility and, as a result, kept a lid on salaries. The case has been closely watched because of the possibility of big damages being awarded and for the opportunity of a glimpse into the world of some of the United States’ elite tech firms. Plaintiffs based their allegations of conspiracy largely on emails circulated among Apple’s late co-founder Steve Jobs, former Google Chief Executive Officer Eric Schmidt, and some of their rivals. In rejecting the proposed settlement, Koh repeatedly referred to a related deal last year involving Disney  and Intuit. Apple and Google workers got proportionally less in the latest agreement compared with the one involving Disney, Koh wrote. To match the earlier settlement, the latest deal “would need to total at least $380 million,” Koh wrote. In the filing on Tuesday, the plaintiffs argued that the $324.5 million deal “ceased to exist” the moment Koh rejected it, by virtue of the settlement terms negotiated by both sides. The companies “should not complain about this state of affairs, given that it is their own doing,” attorneys for the employees wrote.

769,INTC,"US STOCKS- S&P; 500, Nasdaq break 3-day slide but Dow dips","* Indexes close well below session highs * S&P; energy index in correction territory * Citigroup climbs after results * Dow down 0.04 pct, S&P; up 0.2 pct, Nasdaq up 0.3 pct   (Updates with volume, Intel up after the bell) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, Oct 14 (Reuters) - The S&P; 500 and Nasdaq ended up slightly on Tuesday, breaking a three-day string of declines that marked their worst losses since 2011, while the Dow finished lower for a fourth session on lingering worries about global demand. While the S&P; closed in positive territory, it was well off its session highs of more than 1 percent and did little to put investors at ease about the market’s recent selloff. The benchmark index has lost 6.6 percent since its Sept. 18 record closing high and is now up just 1.6 percent for the year, while the Dow is down 1.6 percent since Dec. 31. For a factbox on the market’s selloff, see “Today’s action is typical of a market that hasn’t completed its downward course,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York. “In order for this market to escape further declines, we would have to see the market begin to stabilize and not slip in and out of the plus and minus column consistently.” The selloff has been driven by a host of negative influences including the potential spread of Ebola, the effect of global economic weakness on U.S. earnings and plunging oil prices. The S&P; energy index fell with oil prices, dragging down equities late in the session. The index, which ended 1.2 percent lower for the session, is now down 20.1 percent from its June high, putting it in bear market territory. Despite some early upbeat corporate results, concerns remain about the effect of a stronger dollar on global demand and U.S. earnings, Cardillo said. Citigroup, up 3.1 percent at $51.47, was among the top boosts to the benchmark S&P; index after the bank posted better-than-expected quarterly results and said it would pull out of consumer banking in 11 markets. After the close, shares of Intel gained 1.4 percent to $32.60 following its results and outlook, which included a rosy fourth-quarter forecast. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.88 points, or 0.04 percent, to 16,315.19, the S&P; 500 gained 2.96 points, or 0.16 percent, to 1,877.7 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 13.52 points, or 0.32 percent, to 4,227.17. Volume has picked up with the volatility in the markets in recent days. About 9.2 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 8.4 billion average for the last five sessions, according to data from BATS Global Markets. The largest percentage gainer on the S&P; 500 was Delta Air Lines, up 6.1 percent, while the largest percentage decliner was Newfield Exploration, down 5.7 percent. The largest percentage gainer on the Nasdaq 100 was NXP Semiconductor, which rose 5.0 percent, while the largest percentage decliner was Gilead, down 4.2 percent. Among the most active stocks on the NYSE were Brazil’s Petrobras, down 0.98 percent to $17.10. Intel was among the most actively traded on the Nasdaq.

770,INTC,Intel gives rosy fourth-quarter revenue forecast as PCs recover,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) gave a current-quarter revenue forecast above expectations and said the supply chain was in good shape ahead of holiday season as demand for personal computers recovered. A global slump in personal computer demand that began with Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) launch of the iPad four years ago has stabilized in recent months, in part due to companies replacing employees’ older laptops.  Intel said in a statement on Tuesday that demand for its chips was in good shape. “The worldwide PC supply chain appears to be healthy, with inventory levels appropriate in anticipation of the fourth quarter retail cycles,” Intel said. The recovering PC industry has helped push Intel’s shares 24 percent higher in 2014, making it the top performer in the Dow Jones industrial average. “The telling thing will be next year. Do we continue to get a healthier, more stable PC market?,” said Ascendiant Capital analyst Cody Acree. “I think the enterprise refresh largely plays out by the end of 2014 and then next year the PC industry returns to modest annual declines.”  Tuesday’s results, the first from a major technology company this earnings season, came after Chandler, Arizona-based Microchip (MCHP.O) warned last Thursday of weak demand in China that would soon become visible across the chip industry, sparking a broad selloff in chip stocks. Intel said its gross margins would likely slip to 64 percent in the current quarter from 65 percent in the third quarter. Intel has made little progress expanding from the PC industry into chips for smartphones and has been spending heavily to catch up to Qualcomm (QCOM.O).  For the third quarter, Intel said its mobile and communications group had an operating loss of $1.04 billion on revenue of $1 million, reflecting subsidies Intel has been paying to persuade tablet makers to use its chips. Intel posted third-quarter net income of $3.32 billion, or 66 cents a share, compared with $2.95 billion, or 58 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter as demand for personal computers stabilized. Analysts on average expected EPS of 65 cents. Third-quarter revenue was $14.6 billion, up 8 percent from the year-ago quarter, Intel said in a statement on Tuesday. Intel said it expects fourth-quarter revenue of $14.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million.  Analysts on average expected third-quarter revenue of $14.44 billion and fourth-quarter revenue of $14.48 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

774,INTC,Intel's quarterly results underscore challenge in mobile,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel’s (INTC.O) mobile and communications group took in a scant $1 million in revenue in the third quarter, underscoring the challenge the top chipmaker faces expanding into smartphones and tablets. The Santa Clara, California-based company on Tuesday reported third-quarter results that beat Wall Street’s expectations, helped by a recovery in personal computers, by far its largest market.  Progress in Intel’s smartphone and tablet strategy was less clear. The mobile and communications group had an operating loss of $1.04 billion for the September quarter, worse than a $810 million loss the year before.  The company in recent years was slow to recognize the significance of the smartphone revolution, and CEO Brain Krzanich, who took over in 2012, has accelerated efforts to catch up by subsidizing costs for tablet manufacturers that use its chips. Smartphones and tablets account for a tiny fraction of Intel’s business, but the company sees staking out territory in mobile as key to emerging markets such as  wearable computing products.   Intel is using its deep pockets to help it reach its goal to see its chips used in at least 40 million tablets this year, up from 10 million in 2013. The vast majority of smartphones and tablets are made with processors based on rival technology from Britain’s ARM Holdings Plc Britain’s ARM Holdings ARM.L. Intel’s subsidies are meant to reduce the burden to manufacturers of designing tablets with Intel’s current chips, which require more expensive memory and other components that it says drive up costs. Intel says its future chips will be more cost-effective for manufacturers and will not need subsidies in order to sell.  “The strategy is that over time, we think we can give better performance, more features in that segment of the market and so we wanted to start the work of building our footprint,” Intel CFO Stacy Smith said in a phone interview. Besides tablet subsidies, Intel’s mobile and communications group is feeling the pinch from slower sales of 2G and 3G chips as cellphone makers move to more advanced 4G technology. Qualcomm (QCOM.O) has a major lead in 4G technology over rivals including Intel.      Intel’s subsidies have made it the largest maker of tablet chips after Apple (AAPL.O), which uses its own chips in its iPads, according to market research firm StrategyAnalytics. On a conference call with analysts, Krzanich said that by year end, Intel might slightly exceed its 40 million tablet goal.  The subsidies, which Intel calls “contra revenues”, will drop off as tablet makers switch to Intel’s more cost-effective chips, Intel says. “Based on the new platforms coming to market in the back half of this year and early next year, we expect those contra revenue dollars to start to wane pretty significantly,” Smith said.

776,INTC,Wrist-worn drone wins Intel smart clothing contest,"SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Intel Corp on Monday awarded $500,000 to a group of do-it-yourselfers who developed a wristband that converts to a camera-equipped drone to win a contest the chipmaker hopes will help guarantee it a leading position in the emerging market for wearable computing devices. Aimed at rock climbers, the Nixie quadcopter is worn wrapped around the wrist and springs into the air to take pictures from hard-to-reach places. Like a boomerang, it returns to its owner and then syncs with the owner’s smartphone. Falling behind Qualcomm in recent years after it was slow to embrace smartphones and tablets, Intel has been keen to make sure its processors are at the front of future technology trends. CEO Brian Krzanich in January launched the “Make it Wearable” contest to encourage entrepreneurs and hobbyists to use Intel’s chips to develop new kinds of wearable technology. The prize money is meant to help the winners bring their prototype to market. “This was an experiment to see what we could do in this space and see what kind of creativity we could spawn,” Krzanich said at an award event on Monday. “The real value in this was the diversity of the teams and ideas.” Finalists included a pad that lets premature babies in incubators feel the heartbeat of their mothers, and a necklace that uses patterns of pulses felt on the chest to give cyclists turn-by-turn directions so they don’t need to look at their smartphones. Samsung Electronics, Motorola and other technology companies are rolling out growing numbers of smart watches and fitness bands, but the wearable category has yet to gain major traction with consumers. Apple plans to roll out a smartwatch in 2015. Intel, whose chips are ubiquitous in personal computers and servers, this year bought health tracker startup Basis. It also has teamed up on other wrist-worn gadgets with Fossil and Opening Ceremony. Krzanich, a weekend tinkerer who restored a 1974 Land Cruiser in his free time, is betting that other hobbyists have as much chance as major technology companies of dreaming up compelling wearable computing gadgets. To that end, Intel launched Edison, a tiny computer packaged in an SD-card form factor aimed at making it easy for clothing and gadget makers to integrate the platform into wearable products.

777,INTC,Intel CEO sees China chip partners moving away from rival technology,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp Chief Executive Brian Krzanich expects new semiconductor partners in China to migrate to the U.S. chipmaker’s architecture within a few years and give up on ARM technology more widely used in smartphones and tablets. Intel this year signed deals with Rockchip and Spreadtrum Communications to use Intel’s technology to make chips for low-cost smartphones and tablets aimed at China’s fast-growing consumer market. Spreadtrum and Rockchip specialize in turnkey smartphone and tablet platforms that are easy for manufacturers to use. They typically design their chips with technology licensed from Britain’s ARM Holdings Plc, which competes against Intel’s technology. While the agreements with Intel do not prevent the Chinese chipmakers from continuing to make ARM-based chips, Krzanich told reporters late on Monday he believes that within two or three years they will exclusively use Intel’s architecture.  With leading mobile chipmaker Qualcomm Inc offering high-end chips based on ARM and Taiwan’s MediaTek attacking the Chinese market with inexpensive chips also designed using ARM, adopting Intel’s architecture and cutting-edge factories offer a way to differentiate with better performance and features, Krzanich said. “If you’re a small guy trying to compete, it’s tough to be in that battle.”  Intel was late to mobile and has rushed to make its technology more suitable for tablets and smartphones. While Intel excels at processors for personal computers, it has less experience designing low-power “system on chips” or SoCs, key components in mobile devices, which combine features including processors, Wi-Fi and memory. Intel and Rockchip are working on an Intel-branded tablet SoC, with Rockchip contributing expertise on connectivity, graphics and its experience in China’s domestic market.  Spreadtrum, as part of a deal by Intel to buy 20 percent of its parent company for $1.5 billion, is working with Intel on SoCs expected out next year. Since they are relatively small, both Chinese chipmakers probably do not have the resources to make separate chips based on Intel and ARM technology over the long term, Krzanich said. With demand for smartphones cooling in the United States, manufacturers have increased their focus on China, where demand is strong for handsets priced under $150. Krzanich said Intel might partner with more companies there. “We’re not done. China is the fastest growing market in the world,” he said.

In a press release on Thursday, Intel said it expects revenue to grow by a mid-single digit percentage next year. Analysts on average have been forecasting 3.4 percent revenue growth for 2015.  Kicking off Intel’s annual investor day, Chairman Andy Bryant said he saw progress in Intel’s strategy of staking out a big chunk of market share in tablets this year by offering manufacturers subsidies to use its chips. “I’m not going to tell you I’m proud of losing the kind of money we’re losing but I’m also going to tell you I’m not embarrassed by it like I was a year ago about where we were,” Bryant said. “This is the price you pay for sitting on the sidelines for a number of years and then fighting your way back into the market.” The Santa Clara, California company said it expects gross margins in 2015 to be 62 percent, plus or minus 2 percentage points. Analysts on average expected 63 percent gross margins for 2015 and 2014. Capital spending next year will be about $10.5 billion, the company said, compared to about $11 billion expected in 2014. Intel also said it would increase its dividend by 6 cents to 96 cents on an annual basis. A global slump in personal computer demand that began with Apple Inc’s launch of the iPad four years ago has stabilized in recent months, in part due to companies replacing employees’ older laptops. Intel was late to mobile and under CEO Brian Krzanich, who took over last year, it has rushed to make its technology more suitable for tablets and smartphones and compete better against Qualcomm, MediaTek and others. Krzanich said a plan disclosed this week to merge Intel’s mobile unit with its PC group was in line with manufacturing customers that see their own product lineups of smartphones, tablets and laptops merging.   He said Intel was on track to exceed its goal of seeing its chips used in 40 million tablets this year. That strategy made Intel the No 2 tablet chip supplier in the June quarter, according to market research firm Strategy Analytics, but it cost the company billions of dollars in subsidies.

The purchase price for the privately held Canadian start-up was not disclosed.  The Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker said PasswordBox will become part of the Safe Identity organization within Intel Security Group that is focused on simplifying and strengthening security by delivering ideas that reduce the pain of having to memorize dozens of passwords.  Earlier this year, Intel rebranded security software maker McAfee Inc, which it acquired for about $7.7 billion in 2011, as Intel Security Group.  PasswordBox, founded in 2012, has already been downloaded 14 million times and this year it won best mobile app at CES, a huge annual consumer electronics trade show in Las Vegas. The tech security company’s co-founder and Chief Executive Daniel Robichaud said his goal is to get to a billion users. “We’ve grown really fast in the last 18 months faster than Dropbox and Evernote when they started, and teaming with Intel is our way of getting faster to a billion users,” said Robichaud in a phone interview, referring to other currently popular app-based service providers. PasswordBox last year secured $6 million in a Series A venture funding round led by OMERS Ventures, the venture capital arm of Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, one of Canada’s largest pension funds with over C$65 billion ($57.40 billion) in net assets. “I think the speed of the transaction in this case speaks to the size of the market opportunity,” said Damien Steel, who is a director at OMERS Ventures and on the PasswordBox board.  Steel noted that very few start-ups typically get bought out by a big industry player this early in their lifecycle.

792,INTC,Stephen Hawking hails 'life changing' speech upgrade,"LONDON (Reuters) - Theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking can communicate with the world faster and easier thanks to new technology from Intel Corp and SwiftKey which replaces the decades-old platform that made his computerized voice recognizable around the world. Hawking, the author of best-seller “A Brief History of Time”, has a form of motor neuron disease that has left him almost entirely paralyzed and dependent on a computer to speak and write. “My old system was more than 20 years’ old and I was finding it very difficult to continue to communicate effectively and to do the things I love to do,” he told reporters on Wednesday. “With the improvements made I am now able to write much faster and it means I can continue to give lectures, write papers and books, and meet with my family and friends more easily. “This new system is life-changing for me and I hope it will serve me well for the next 20 years.” Intel said it had been working on the new platform, called ACAT (Assistive Context Aware Toolkit), in collaboration with Hawking for three years. The new system, which is controlled by an infrared switch mounted on Hawking’s glasses, has doubled his speech rates and sped up common tasks, such as finding a computer file, by about 10 times, Intel Labs engineer Lama Nachman said. It uses predictive text algorithms developed with six-year-old British software company SwiftKey, similar to those found on smartphones, to select words after inputting just 10-15 percent of letters, significantly reducing the effort and time required. The software will be made public early next year so it can be used to help other people with motor neuron diseases, quadriplegia and other disabilities. “By making this technology freely available it has the potential to greatly improve the lives of disabled people all over the world,” Hawking said. One element has not been updated, however.

Luxottica’s brands include Ray Ban, Oakley and Persol, while it has licenses to use brands including Chanel and Tiffany.   Intel, which was late to the smartphone and tablet industries, is striving to be at the forefront of future trends in mobile computing and expand into new markets, including smart watches and other Internet-connected “wearables”.

797,INTC,Exclusive: Intel Security CTO Michael Fey joins Blue Coat as COO,"(Reuters) - Michael Fey has left Intel Security Group to become chief operating officer at Blue Coat Systems Inc, a privately owned network security company. Fey was one of the few top McAfee managers to stay with the company after it was bought by Intel Corp in 2011. McAfee is now part of Intel Security Group, where Fey had been chief technology officer. Fey told Reuters his role at Blue Coat would be “very similar” to his previous job. “But I get to focus on the cloud and the advanced threats space more,” he said. “Blue Coat had tremendous growth behind the scenes and now I get to focus on taking that growth and trying to get it to the billion-dollar revenue mark,” he said in a telephone interview. McAfee confirmed Fey’s departure in an email. Since the $7.7 billion acquisition by Intel, McAfee has lost senior managers and key talent in technology development, research and sales. At Blue Coat, Fey will replace David Murphy, who will stay on as a strategic adviser to the board. “David has been an extremely important person in the company and he remains a substantial shareholder and one of our key go-to people for strategy,” Blue Coat Chief Executive Greg Clark told Reuters. Blue Coat, bought by San Francisco-based private equity firm Thoma Bravo for $1.3 billion in February 2012, operates in an area where businesses and governments are spending more to counter and contain cyber security threats. Worldwide spending on information security will increase 7.9 percent to $71.1 billion in 2014 and a further 8.2 percent in 2015 to reach $76.9 billion, Gartner said in a report.  Clark said Blue Coat was “on the trajectory” to meet its $1 billion annual revenue target in the next 36 months. He declined to disclose the company’s current revenue.

The chief invesmtent officer of BlackRock, Rick Rieder, told Il Sole 24 Ore daily that Italian government bonds were now less attractive because of very low interest rates. The share of Italian and European sovereign debt in BlackRock’s global investment portfolio will be lower than in the past, he said. Plans by Italian oil major Eni for major asset sales to help fund exploration and its dividend payments have hit problems due to diving oil and gas prices, sources say. The luxury eyewear maker is joining forces with U.S. chipmaker Intel Corp to develop glasses that combine its top fashion brands with technology that could allow wearers to access information about their health or location. Andrea Guerra, former chief executive of Italian eyewear maker Luxottica, will take up a role advising the government of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, a person close to the government said on Wednesday.

800,INTC,Intel to invest $1.6 billion in China factory,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) will invest $1.6 billion to upgrade its factory in the city of Chengdu in western China, the latest sign of how the chipmaker is deepening ties in a market that is proving increasingly troublesome for some U.S. technology peers. As part of the upgrade, Intel said in a statement on Thursday it would bring its most advanced chip-testing technology to China. In exchange it will receive local and regional government support for construction.  “Deploying our newest advanced testing technology in China shows our commitment to innovating jointly with China,” Intel executive vice president William Holt said in the statement. “The fully upgraded Chengdu plant will help the Chinese semiconductor industry and boost regional economic growth.” The announcement comes three months after Intel purchased a minority stake in a government-controlled semiconductor company to jointly design and distribute mobile chips, an industry that China considers to be of strategic importance.  Intel’s fortunes in China contrast with the travails of its rival, Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), which is expected to announce in the coming days a potentially record-breaking settlement with Chinese antitrust regulators.  China’s investigation into San Diego-based Qualcomm, as well as a spate of recent probes against firms including Microsoft Corp, have prompted an outcry from foreign business lobbies. They say the Chinese government is increasingly adopting strong-arm tactics to yield technology-sharing or other arrangements beneficial to domestic industry. The government, meanwhile, has defended its regulatory scrutiny as even-handed. It has pointed to a history of Qualcomm and Microsoft facing similar antitrust probes in Western countries. Analysts say there is a broad recognition that foreign companies must do more to stay in China’s good graces. “Intel’s taking the approach that’s appreciated by the Chinese government,” Nomura analyst Leping Huang said. “These days if you want to make money in China, you have to invest in China.” ",12042014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-intel-china-factory/intel-to-invest-1-6-billion-in-china-factory-idUSKCN0JI0E520141204

802,INTC,Intel unveils platform to simplify connectivity of products,"SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Intel Corp on Tuesday unveiled a new platform to make it easier for companies to create Internet-connected smart products using its chips, security and software. Intel’s platform is like a set of building blocks based on the chipmaker’s components and software for companies to create smart, connected devices, Doug Davis, head of Intel’s Internet of Things business, said at a launch event in San Francisco. It also aims to make it easier to connect to data centers in order analyze data collected from devices’ sensors. “We’re creating compute capability in end-point devices that scale from our highest performance Xeon processor to the Quark family of products,” Davis said, referring to Intel’s chips. After moving slowly in recent years to adapt its personal computer chips for smartphones and tablets, Intel is determined to make sure it is on the leading edge of future computing trends, industry experts and company executives have said. Adding processors, sensors and web connectivity to devices from soccer balls to industrial machinery, an emerging trend dubbed the Internet of Things, has become a new battleground for Intel, rival Qualcomm and other technology companies. The install base of wireless gadgets will more than double by the end of the decade, with most of the growth coming from smart devices other than PCs and smartphones, according to market research firm ABI Research. Intel’s Internet of Things Group had $530 million in revenue in the September quarter. That accounted for just 4 percent of Intel’s total revenue in the quarter, but it grew 14 percent over the previous year, which was faster than the company’s PC business. Dell, SAP, Tata Consultancy, Accenture  and other companies are working with the new reference model, Davis said.

809,INTC,Intel Corp chief shows wrist-worn drone; promises to employ more women,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) Chief Executive Brian Krzanich showed off a computer built into a jacket button and a wristband that transforms into a selfie-snapping flying camera, as the chipmaker extends its push into smart wearable gadgets.   Speaking at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Tuesday, Krzanich also announced a five-year, $300 million investment in math-related education and other programs to help employ more women and minorities in the technology and the video game industries. Krzanich used most of his keynote to talk up Intel’s efforts in computerized apparel and other sensor-packed gadgets - nascent markets that the chipmaker and other technology companies hope will fuel future growth as demand for smartphones and tablets loses steam. Curie, a new button-sized computer for smart clothes, is due out later in 2015 and includes Bluetooth radio as well as the latest from Intel’s Quark line of low-power chips. Intel’s chips so far have not made significant inroads into wearable gadgets such as fitness bands or smart watches. “With this product they can deliver wearables in a range of form factors,” Krzanich said of Intel’s manufacturing customers. “Rings, bags, bracelets, pendants, and yes, even the buttons on our jackets.” Intel is working with Oakley to launch a smart gadget for athletes later this year, Krzanich said. The chipmaker in December announced it was developing smart glasses with Luxottica, which owns the Oakley brand.  Krzanich demonstrated autonomous flying drones able to navigate around obstacles. He also showed a smaller drone worn on the wrist until it is launched into the air. Called Nixie, the camera-equipped gadget in November won a wearable computing contest sponsored by Intel.  Intel was slow to launch chips for smartphones and tablets, and Krzanich, who took over as CEO in 2013, has made it a top priority to avoid repeating that mistake with future computing trends. Krzanich announced a goal to reach full representation of women and minorities in Intel’s workforce by 2020. Like most Silicon Valley companies, Intel has a poor track record employing women and some minorities. Just a quarter of Intel’s U.S. employees in 2013 were women and 12 percent of its workforce were Hispanic or African American, according to company data. Last year, the chipmaker found itself in the midst of  a controversy over gender equality in the video game industry after it pulled advertising from a gaming website in response to an email campaign.  In a movement that has come to be known as “Gamergate,” self-described videogame fans lashed back aggressively online at criticism about sexism in gaming culture. A portion of the responses have come in the form of threats of violence on Twitter against the women in the video game industry. Intel later apologized and resumed advertising on the gaming website.

Speaking at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Tuesday, Krzanich also announced a five-year, $300 million investment in math-related education and other programs to help employ more women and minorities in the technology and the video game industries. Krzanich used most of his keynote to talk up Intel’s efforts in computerized apparel and other sensor-packed gadgets - nascent markets that the chipmaker and other technology companies hope will fuel future growth as demand for smartphones and tablets loses steam. Curie, a new button-sized computer for smart clothes, is due out later in 2015 and includes Bluetooth radio as well as the latest from Intel’s Quark line of low-power chips. Intel’s chips so far have not made significant inroads into wearable gadgets such as fitness bands or smart watches. “With this product they can deliver wearables in a range of form factors,” Krzanich said of Intel’s manufacturing customers. “Rings, bags, bracelets, pendants, and yes, even the buttons on our jackets.” Intel is working with Oakley to launch a smart gadget for athletes later this year, Krzanich said. The chipmaker in December announced it was developing smart glasses with Luxottica, which owns the Oakley brand. Krzanich demonstrated autonomous flying drones able to navigate around obstacles. He also showed a smaller drone worn on the wrist until it is launched into the air. Called Nixie, the camera-equipped gadget in November won a wearable computing contest sponsored by Intel. Intel was slow to launch chips for smartphones and tablets, and Krzanich, who took over as CEO in 2013, has made it a top priority to avoid repeating that mistake with future computing trends. Krzanich announced a goal to reach full representation of women and minorities in Intel’s workforce by 2020. Like most Silicon Valley companies, Intel has a poor track record employing women and some minorities. Just a quarter of Intel’s U.S. employees in 2013 were women and 12 percent of its workforce were Hispanic or African American, according to company data. Last year, the chipmaker found itself in the midst of  a controversy over gender equality in the video game industry after it pulled advertising from a gaming website in response to an email campaign. In a movement that has come to be known as “Gamergate,” self-described videogame fans lashed back aggressively online at criticism about sexism in gaming culture. A portion of the responses have come in the form of threats of violence on Twitter against the women in the video game industry. Intel later apologized and resumed advertising on the gaming website.

811,INTC,"Disney, Sony, DreamWorks seek to throw out anti-poaching lawsuit","Jan 12 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co, Sony Corp  and DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc urged a federal judge to throw out a antitrust lawsuit accusing them of conspiring not to poach each other’s animators in order to keep wages down. The defendants told U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, that the plaintiff animators took too long to sue by waiting until five years after the U.S. Department of Justice in 2009 began probing recruiting practices at Silicon Valley and other technology companies. In a Friday night filing, the defendants also called it “implausible” to believe they would collude to suppress wages after the federal probe began, and after several companies including Disney had settled related private litigation. “The court might ask what, exactly, these plaintiffs have uncovered that was somehow missed by the industrious High-Tech plaintiffs,” the companies said. “The short answer is: nothing.” Daniel Small, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, declined immediate comment on Monday, saying he had yet to review the defendants’ filings. Blue Sky Studios, a unit of 21st Century Fox Inc, is also a defendant. Lighting artist Georgia Cano, character effects artist Robert Nitsch and production engineer David Wentworth are the named plaintiffs. The lawsuit accuses the defendants of having illegally suppressed animators’ wages since 2004 by agreeing not to cold call employees, alerting each other to hiring offers, and agreeing not to offer more pay in response to counteroffers. Disney’s Lucasfilm and Pixar units, and Intuit Inc  settled similar claims covering other workers for a combined $20 million, while Apple Inc, Google Inc, Intel Corp and Adobe Systems Inc reached their own $324.5 million settlement last May. Koh last August rejected the $324.5 million accord as too low. Technology workers later asked the federal appeals court in San Francisco to overturn that ruling. As in other anti-poaching lawsuits, the animators’ lawsuit relies in part on emails and testimony under oath. It cites, among other things, a 2005 email from a Pixar human resources executive alluding to a “gentleman’s agreement” not to poach, and testimony in which Lucasfilm founder and “Star Wars” director George Lucas was said to want to avoid bidding wars “because we don’t have the margins for that sort of thing.” A hearing on the dismissal motion is set for March 26. The case is In re: Animation Workers Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 14-04062.       (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York.

812,INTC,Intel forecasts disappointing revenue; shares fall,"(Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) forecast current-quarter revenue and gross margins that disappointed investors, sending its shares down more than 2 percent in extended trading.  Revenue from its mainstay PC business fell about 3 percent to $8.9 billion in the fourth quarter from the third, raising doubts about the expected recovery of the personal computer business. Global personal computer shipments fell 2.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, according to research firm IDC, capping three years of declines.  That was not as bad as expected, raising hopes among some investors that the PC market is starting to stabilize.  That optimism has helped drive Intel’s stock up 16 percent in the past three months, compared with a 7 percent gain for the S&P; 500, to levels not seen since 2001.  In the light of that, Wall Street was hoping for more encouraging figures. “The top line looked a little bit light of the Street and gross margin looked a little bit light,” Christopher Rolland, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, said. “PC was weaker in the fourth quarter than we were expecting,” Rolland added. The chipmaker forecast first-quarter revenue of $13.76 billion, plus or minus $500 million, and gross margins of about 60 percent, far below the 65.4 percent it reported in the fourth quarter. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $13.77 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Despite exceeding the goal of seeing its chips used in 40 million tablets this year, the heavy subsidies that Intel offered added to its operating loss in its mobile business.  Net income for the fourth quarter rose to $3.66 billion, or 74 cents per share, for the quarter ended Dec. 27, from $2.6 billion, or 51 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $14.7 billion from $13.8 billion. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 66 cents per share on revenue of $14.71 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Energy shares extended recent losses as U.S. oil prices  settled down more than 4 percent after weak U.S. economic data spurred worries over oil demand. The S&P; energy index fell 1.2 percent. “We’re probably going to see slowing in the global economy, and it will be very difficult to sail through a global recession without getting touched,” said Scott Colyer, chief executive officer of Advisors Asset Management in Monument, Colorado. The S&P; 500 for the first time in a month ended below 2,000, considered a psychological support level, and closed below its 120-day moving average, suggesting more weakness ahead. The CBOE Volatility index notched a fifth day of gains, up 4.2 percent at 22.39. Expectations for U.S. fourth-quarter earnings have been scaled back sharply, with growth now estimated at 3.5 percent, compared with an Oct. 1 estimate of 11.2 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. The S&P; financial sector dropped 1.3 percent. Bank of America lost 5.2 percent to $15.20, among the S&P; 500’s biggest drags, after the second-largest U.S. bank by assets reported a 14 percent slump in quarterly profit.  Citigroup shares fell 3.7 percent to $47.23 after its results. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 106.38 points, or 0.61 percent, to 17,320.71, the S&P; 500 lost 18.6 points, or 0.92 percent, to 1,992.67 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 68.50 points, or 1.48 percent, to 4,570.82. After the close, S&P; 500 e-minis fell further, hitting session lows. The benchmark S&P; 500 is now down 4.7 percent from its Dec. 29 record high. Adding to volatility, the Swiss National Bank scrapped its cap on the franc currency in a surprise move. U.S.-traded Swiss stocks climbed. Credit Suisse was up 1.8 percent at $23.22 and Novartis jumped 3.9 percent to $100.58 as a strengthening franc made U.S.-dollar denominated stocks cheaper. Best Buy shares tumbled 14.1 percent to $34.30 as the worst-performing S&P; 500 component. The electronics retailer expects same-store sales growth to be flat to negative in the first two quarters of its fiscal year. After the bell, shares of Intel dipped 2.1 percent to $35.44 following its results. In economic news, U.S. producer prices recorded their biggest fall in more than three years in December, while other reports showed mixed signals for manufacturing in New York state and the mid-Atlantic region in January. About 7.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 7.3 billion average for the last five sessions, according to BATS Global Markets.

Investors attempted to interpret the impact of the move by the Swiss National Bank. The decision might be seen as foreshadowing a large stimulus move by the European Central Bank next week that would further weaken the euro, or as a safeguard against a possible Greek exit from the euro zone that could potentially destabilize the bloc. “Most central banks have been really clear about how to telegraph their messages, particularly here in the U.S., so having a bank intentionally surprise caught everybody a little flat footed,” said Dan Curtin, global investment specialist at JP Morgan Private Bank in Boston. Shares of retail foreign exchange broker FXCM Inc, were halted, after it said it may be in breach of some regulatory capital requirements following client losses related to the Swiss move to ditch the cap on the Swiss franc’s value. Shares of Interactive Brokers, whose clients also are exposed to currency trades, were down 5.8 percent. The company said several customers suffered losses in excess of their deposit due to the sudden move in the Swiss franc. Gain Capital, down 4 percent, said its financial position remained sound after the franc move. Futures pared losses after data showing U.S. consumer prices recorded their biggest decline in six years in December and underlying inflation pressures were benign, which could boost the case for the Federal Reserve to delay its first interest rate increase. Separately, U.S. manufacturing output rose modestly in December, its fourth straight month of gains, but slowed from strong gains in the prior month.

That was not as bad as expected, raising hopes among some investors that the PC market is starting to stabilize, but Intel did not deliver any spirited talk about a recovery on Thursday. “In 2015 we’re predicting kind of flat, nothing spectacular but stable, is how I would call it,” Intel Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told Reuters in an interview. Despite the tepid PC market, Intel is targeting revenue growth this year in the “mid-single digit percentage points”, which Smith said would be helped by faster growth in providing chips for data centers and Internet-connected gadgets. Optimism over a PC recovery has propelled Intel’s stock up 16 percent in the past three months, compared with a 7 percent gain for the S&P; 500, to levels not seen since 2001. In the light of that, Wall Street was hoping for more encouraging figures. “The top line looked a little bit light of the Street and gross margin looked a little bit light,” Christopher Rolland, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, said. “PC was weaker in the fourth quarter than we were expecting,” Rolland added. The chipmaker forecast first-quarter revenue of $13.76 billion, plus or minus $500 million, and gross margins of about 60 percent, far below the 65.4 percent it reported in the fourth quarter. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $13.77 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income for the fourth quarter rose to $3.66 billion, or 74 cents per share, for the quarter ended Dec. 27, from $2.6 billion, or 51 cents per share, a year earlier. (bit.ly/1C5t7Fo) Revenue rose to $14.7 billion from $13.8 billion. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 66 cents per share on revenue of $14.71 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

824,INTC,UPDATE 1-AMD first-quarter revenue forecast disappoints,"(Adds forecast, analyst comment, shares) By Arathy S Nair Jan 20 (Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices Inc  forecast weaker-than-expected first-quarter revenue and said it taking steps to return its computing and graphics businesses to a “healthy trajectory” from the second quarter. The company also reported lower-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue as it struggles with weak sales of graphic cards and to compete with Intel Corp in a declining PC market. AMD shares were down nearly 1 percent at $2.22 in extended trading. The results and outlook weren’t any worse than expected, said Wedbush Securities Inc analyst Betsy Van Hees. “I think we are going to need to see some more restructuring and realignment in the computing and graphics side of the business,” Van Hees said. AMD, which said in October it would cut 7 percent of its workforce, has been shifting focus to gaming consoles and low-power servers to combat falling laptop sales. But progress has lagged Wall Street’s expectations. While the console business has been doing well, it hasn’t been enough to offset the effects of the struggling computing business, Van Hees said. Last week Intel gave a disappointing forecast for first-quarter revenue and AMD, a minor player in the PC processor market, followed suit on Tuesday. AMD’s revenue fell 22 percent to $1.24 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec 27, in line with Wall Street’s estimate. The company forecast revenue to fall 15 percent, plus or minus 3 percent, in the current quarter from the fourth quarter. That translates to about $1.02-$1.09 billion, well short of analysts average estimate of $1.2 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. AMD reported a net loss of $364 million, or 47 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, compared with a profit of $89 million, or 12 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, AMD broke even on a per share basis, just below analysts average estimate of a profit of 1 cent per share.

825,INTC,UPDATE 5-ASML shares hit record after fourth quarter tops forecasts,"* Q4 net income 305 million euros vs f’cast 221 million * Sales 1.49 billion vs f’cast 1.31 billion * Boosts dividend 15 pct, announces new 1 bln euros buyback * Shares hit record high before easing, up 0.6 percent   (Updates shares, writes through) By Toby Sterling AMSTERDAM, Jan 21 (Reuters) - ASML Holding NV, the world’s largest maker of semiconductor production equipment, has reported forecast-beating results on the back of stronger-than-expected demand from memory chip makers, sending its shares to a record high. The Veldhoven, Netherlands-based company remains sensitive to cyclical swings in the chip sector but has recently hit a strong run of form, driven by consumer demand for new mobile phones and other communication products. ASML, whose rivals include Applied Materials, which it outranks by stock market value, and Nikon, reported fourth-quarter net income of 305 million euros ($445.6 million) on sales of 1.49 billion, beating expectations of 221 million and 1.31 billion respectively. The group also said it would raise its dividend 15 percent to 0.70 euros per share and launched a new 1 billion euro share buyback, extending a programme which has run for several years. Its stock hit a record 94 euros and was up 0.6 percent at 90.08 euros by 1431 GMT. ASML makes lithography machines, which use highly focused beams of light to trace out the circuitry of computer chips. It is a key supplier to the world’s biggest chipmakers including Samsung and Intel. Its results are therefore sometimes seen as a proxy for how quickly electronics makers are investing to create the next generation of products. In this instance they suggest strong demand for memory chips used in all manner of mobile devices, and a careful approach to capital spending by top microprocessor maker Intel, which is investing in a new class of chips for laptops capable of cord-free wireless charging and new 3D features. ASML said growth in the first half of 2015 was expected to come from contract chipmakers, known as foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. TSM received a contract from Apple last year to make chips for the iPhone 6. Chief Executive Peter Wennink said the foundry business was “in its most aggressive ramp-up that we’ve ever seen, to support new mobile and communications” devices. He said ASML’s order backlog had increased to 2.8 billion euros from 2.41 billion three months before. For logic chips, such as those made by Intel, he said the picture was mixed; one unnamed customer was racing to begin using ASML’s next generation of machines in production by 2016, while others are still expanding use of the current generation. Many analysts are wary of the high valuation of the stock, which is trading at around 25 times forecast earnings against a peer average of 17 times, according to Reuters data, despite vulnerabilities to economic swings which in 2008 caused a sharp slowdown and forced it to cut 1,000 jobs. “This is clearly a strong update but given (the) current valuation strong updates are needed to support the share,” ABN AMRO analyst Marc Hesselink said in a note to clients. Janardan Menon at brokerage Liberum said ASML’s medium-term prospects may be overdone, as sales of both smartphones and tablets had peaked after years of rapid growth. “The mood at the memory chip makers is weakening as we speak,” he said. Menon added ASML’s order book was strengthened by foundry orders for the first half of 2015, but there was little evidence of new appetite from chip makers to invest in its next-generation equipment. “The likelihood is for some weakness in the second half,” he said, rating the stock “hold”.

832,INTC,"Soros bet on Devon Energy, Transocean ahead of oil price rise","NEW YORK, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Soros Fund Management LLC took new positions in the energy sector in the fourth quarter, including stakes in Devon Energy Corp and Transocean Ltd , a regulatory filing showed Tuesday. The hedge fund firm, which manages the investments of investor George Soros and his family, bought 385,497 shares of Devon Energy and 149,000 shares of Transocean in the fourth quarter, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The actions appear to be timely, as oil prices and energy stocks have rebounded this month after a months-long slump. While Brent crude prices fell about 60 percent between June and January, they have rebounded more than 10 percent in February, with Brent crude hitting its highest this year on Tuesday at $63 a barrel. The S&P; energy index, which had fallen about 20 percent between June and January, has rebounded more than 8 percent in February. Soros’s purchase of Transocean shares also came ahead of the company’s announcement on Feb. 16 that its chief executive,  Steven Newman, was stepping down. Transocean shares are up nearly 4 percent this year. A Soros spokesman declined to comment. The firm also dumped its stakes in technology companies  Google Inc, Apple Inc and Intel Corp , while also liquidating positions in Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Netflix Inc during the quarter. By dumping the stake in Apple, the fund missed out on a 16 percent rally in the iPhone maker’s shares this year. Soros sold 17,142 class A Google shares and 67,572 class C shares, 1.1 million Apple shares and 3.9 million Intel shares. The fund, which disclosed a Yahoo Inc position in the third quarter, sold 3.2 million of its 5.1 million shares in the latest period. Soros is not the only hedge fund to focus on Intel in recent months, as hedge fund manager Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates told cable television network CNBC in mid-January that he was betting against the company’s shares. Soros increased its General Motors Co. stake by 412,438 shares to 3.9 million shares, while also adding to its Herbalife Ltd position.

835,INTC,'Jihadi John' killer from Islamic State beheading videos unmasked as Londoner,"LONDON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The masked “Jihadi John” killer who fronted Islamic State beheading videos has been identified as Mohammed Emwazi, a British computer programming graduate from a well-to-do London family who was known to the security services. The black-clad militant brandishing a knife and speaking with an English accent was shown in videos released by Islamic State (IS) apparently decapitating hostages including Americans, Britons and Syrians. The 26-year-old militant used the videos to threaten the West, admonish its Arab allies and taunt President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron before petrified hostages cowering in orange jump suits. Emwazi’s name was first disclosed by the Washington Post, citing unidentified former associates. Two U.S. government sources who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed to Reuters that investigators believed Jihadi John was Emwazi. Dressed entirely in black, a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the bridge of his nose and a holster under his left arm, Jihadi John became a menacing symbol of Islamic State brutality and one of the world’s most wanted men. Hostages called him John as he and other Britons in Islamic State had been nicknamed the Beatles. Emwazi was born in Kuwait but came to Britain aged 6 and graduated with a computer programming degree from the University of Westminster before coming to the attention of Britain’s main domestic intelligence service, MI5, according to an account given by Asim Qureshi, the research director of the Cage charity that campaigns for those detained on terrorism charges. Emwazi, a fluent Arabic speaker, said MI5 had tried to recruit him and then prevented him from traveling abroad, forcing him to flee abroad without telling his family, Qureshi told a news conference in London. Emwazi traveled to Syria around 2012, Qureshi said. MI5 does not publicly comment on the identity of militants or their backgrounds while an investigation is still ongoing. The British government and police declined to confirm or deny Emwazi’s identity, citing an ongoing security investigation. “We don’t confirm or deny matters relating to intelligence,” said a spokeswoman for Cameron, who has ordered spy agencies and soldiers to track down the killer. “Jihadi John” rose to notoriety in August 2014 when a video appeared showing a masked man raging against the United States before apparently beheading U.S. citizen James Foley off camera. Intelligence services in the United States and Britain used a variety of investigative techniques including voice and facial recognition as well as interviews with former hostages to identify the man, intelligence sources said. But security officials made great efforts to avoid publicly naming Emwazi, fearing that would make him more difficult to catch. Two intelligence sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said they were uneasy that the name had been revealed. There was no answer at two addresses in west London where Emwazi was listed to have lived. Neighbors described the family as “normal people” and “friendly”. “This is the first time anything like this happens in this neighborhood,” said Fatima Al-Baqali. “We have to be careful now. I didn’t know this family and I usually know everyone here.” Qureshi, of the Cage charity which describes itself as having campaigned against the ‘War on Terror’ for more than a decade, said that although he could not be certain Emwazi was John, there were some “striking similarities”. He declined to elaborate. In a meeting with reporters in London, Qureshi painted a picture of a kind and thoughtful young man who faced harassment from MI5, which apparently suspected he wanted to join the Somali Islamist militant group al Shabaab. British authorities have linked Emwazi to another British militant killed in Somalia in a U.S. drone attack.  A British court ruling dated December 2011 reported that Elwazi was an associate of Bilal al Berjawi, a high-ranking leader of the Somali-based militant group al Shabaab, a person in possession of the court ruling said.  Reuters has not seen the original court ruling. Media reports said he helped supervise the recruitment and training of new Shabaab members.  Qureshi said British spies had tried to recruit Emwazi as a source but declined to provide specifics. “There’s one character that I remember, one kind person that I remember and then I see that image and there doesn’t seem to be a correlation between the two,” Qureshi told reporters. “I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London..,” Emwazi wrote in an email to Cage. He felt like “a person imprisoned and controlled by security service men, (who) stopping me from living my new life in my birthplace and my country, Kuwait”. Cage said Emwazi was detained in Tanzania, where he went for a safari holiday with two friends in August 2009. He was deported to Amsterdam and interrogated by MI5 and a Dutch intelligence officer and then sent back to Britain, according to Qureshi. Reuters was unable to immediately verify the version of events given by the charity, which provoked criticism for shifting the responsibility for Emwazi’s crimes. “I think this is an attempt to deflect attention from Jihadi John,” said Shiraz Maher, Senior Fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation, King’s College London.  “They’re trying to lay the blame for this at the feet of the British government,” he told Sky news. The Cage charity, which also worked with the family of Michael Adebolajo, the Muslim covert who with an accomplice killed a British soldier in London in May 2013, said both men had been victims of undue pressure from the security services. Britain’s MI5 security service was not immediately available for comment on those allegations. MI5 has argued to British lawmakers that it would be damaging to national security to comment on allegations that is sought to recruit Adebolajo. The British Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee said last year that MI5 had investigated Adebolajo five times, twice as a high priority, but had found no evidence that any attack was being planned. The Committee said it had found no evidence that Adebolajo was harassed by MI5. After becoming frustrated following three failed attempts to return to Kuwait, and changing his name to Mohammed al-Ayan, Emwazi left his parents’ home and slipped out of Britain, according to Qureshi. Four months later, police visited the family home to say they had information he had entered Syria. His family thought he was in Turkey doing aid work. “Jihadi John” fronted gruesome Islamic State videos that showed either the killing or bodies of victims including U.S. citizens James Foley, Steven Sotloff and Peter Kassig, Britons David Haines and Alan Henning, Japanese Kenji Goto and over 20 Syrian soldiers.

837,INTC,British PM Cameron vows to hunt down 'Jihadi John',"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister David Cameron vowed on Friday to use all means at his disposal to hunt down militants such as “Jihadi John” after the killer was identified as a Kuwaiti-born computer programming graduate from London. The black-clad militant brandishing a knife and speaking with an English accent was shown in videos released by Islamic State (IS) apparently decapitating hostages including Americans, Britons and Syrians. “When there are people anywhere in the world who commit appalling and heinous crimes against British citizens, we will do everything we can with the police, with the security services, with all that we have at our disposal to find these people and put them out of action,” Cameron said. Cameron refused to comment on the identification of “Jihadi John” as 26-year-old British militant Mohammed Emwazi, but said that people should get behind the security services, which he praised as impressive and dedicated to defending Britain. Emwazi was known to the security services, which had tried to recruit him, according to prisoners’ group Cage. The case has sparked debate about whether the security services let him slip through their grasp to join IS in Syria. Dressed entirely in black, a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the bridge of his nose and a holster under his left arm, Jihadi John became a menacing symbol of Islamic State brutality and one of the world’s most wanted men.

Emwazi’s name was first disclosed by the Washington Post. Two U.S. government sources who spoke on condition of anonymity told Reuters that investigators believed Jihadi John was Emwazi. The Sun and The Daily Mail newspapers published a picture showing a schoolboy Emwazi smiling and sitting cross-legged on the grass at the front of the photograph from the St Mary Magdalene Church of England primary school in Maida Vale, West London. A picture of him as a student was later broadcast by Sky News, showing a young man with a moustache and goatee beard, wearing a cap with a logo resembling the P from the Pittsburgh Pirates U.S. Major League Baseball team.

But there was little patience with the narrative of Emwazi’s life presented by Qureshi, who called him a “beautiful man”. “Cage maintain the enemy is the security services, is the state,” Professor Anthony Glees, Director of the Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies, told Reuters. “The truth could not be more different. Intelligence services are on the whole non-interventionist.” Cameron’s spokeswoman said it was “completely reprehensible” to seek to shift the blame from a killer to those seeking to keep British citizens safe.  The daughter of David Haines, a Scottish aid worker who was beheaded by Islamic State in September, told ITV news there should be more security at airports. Bethany Haines also said she would not rest until Emwazi received a “bullet between his eyes”.  The family of Steven Sotloff, a U.S. journalist beheaded in August, said they had faith his killer would be brought to justice.  “There’s going to be no closure until these people are brought to justice,” family spokesman Barak Barfi told Sky News. MI5 does not publicly comment on the identity of militants or their backgrounds while an investigation is still ongoing.  “Jihadi John” fronted Islamic State videos that showed either the killing or bodies of victims including U.S. citizens James Foley, Steven Sotloff and Peter Kassig, Britons David Haines and Alan Henning, Japanese Kenji Goto and over 20 Syrian soldiers.

838,INTC,UPDATE 1-Lenovo to allay security concerns with free McAfee LiveSafe,"(Adds Lenovo quote, details) Feb 27 (Reuters) - China’s Lenovo Group Ltd on Friday said it will offer free subscriptions to Intel Corp  security software to customers who bought laptops that were shipped with a program known as “Superfish,” which made PCs vulnerable to cyberattacks. Lenovo, the world’s biggest personal computer maker, last week advised customers to uninstall the Superfish program. Security experts and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security recommended the program be removed because it made users vulnerable to what are known as SSL spoofing techniques that can enable remote attackers to read encrypted web traffic, steal credentials and perform other attacks. Lenovo announced the offer to provide six-month subscriptions to Intel’s McAfee LiveSafe on Friday as it also disclosed plans to “significantly” reduce the amount of software that it ships with new computers. Pre-loaded programs will include Microsoft Corp’s  Windows operating system, security products, Lenovo applications and programs “required” to make unique hardware such as 3D cameras work well, Lenovo said. “This should eliminate what our industry calls ‘adware’ and ‘bloatware,’” the Lenovo statement said. Adi Pinhas, chief executive of Palo Alto, California-based Superfish, said in a statement last week that his company’s software helps users achieve more relevant search results based on images of products viewed. He said the vulnerability was “inadvertently” introduced by Israel-based Komodia, which built the application that Lenovo advised customers to uninstall. Komodia declined comment.

839,INTC,'Jihadi John' killer from Islamic State beheading videos unmasked as Londoner,"LONDON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The masked “Jihadi John” killer who fronted Islamic State beheading videos has been identified as Mohammed Emwazi, a British computer programming graduate from a well-to-do London family who was known to the security services. The black-clad militant brandishing a knife and speaking with an English accent was shown in videos released by Islamic State (IS) apparently decapitating hostages including Americans, Britons and Syrians. The 26-year-old militant used the videos to threaten the West, admonish its Arab allies and taunt President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron before petrified hostages cowering in orange jump suits. Emwazi’s name was first disclosed by the Washington Post. Two U.S. government sources who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed to Reuters that investigators believed Jihadi John was Emwazi. Dressed entirely in black, a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the bridge of his nose and a holster under his left arm, Jihadi John became a menacing symbol of Islamic State brutality and one of the world’s most wanted men. Hostages called him John as he and other Britons in Islamic State had been nicknamed the Beatles. He was unmasked publicly for the first time on Friday by British media which published a photograph showing Emwazi as a  schoolboy. The Daily Mail newspaper published a picture showing Emwazi smiling and sitting cross-legged on the grass at the front of the photograph from the St Mary Magdalene Church of England primary school in Maida Vale, West London. Emwazi was born in Kuwait but came to Britain aged 6 and graduated with a computer programming degree from the University of Westminster before coming to the attention of Britain’s main domestic intelligence service, MI5, according to an account given by Asim Qureshi, the research director of the Cage charity that campaigns for those detained on terrorism charges. Emwazi, a fluent Arabic speaker, said MI5 had tried to recruit him and then prevented him from traveling abroad, forcing him to flee abroad without telling his family, Qureshi told a news conference in London. Emwazi traveled to Syria around 2012, Qureshi said. MI5 does not publicly comment on the identity of militants or their backgrounds while an investigation is still ongoing. The British government and police declined to confirm or deny Emwazi’s identity, citing an ongoing security investigation. “We don’t confirm or deny matters relating to intelligence,” said a spokeswoman for Cameron, who has ordered spy agencies and soldiers to track down the killer. “Jihadi John” rose to notoriety in August 2014 when a video appeared showing a masked man raging against the United States before apparently beheading U.S. citizen James Foley off camera. Intelligence services in the United States and Britain used a variety of investigative techniques including voice and facial recognition as well as interviews with former hostages to identify the man, intelligence sources said. But security officials made great efforts to avoid publicly naming Emwazi, fearing that would make him more difficult to catch. Two intelligence sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said they were uneasy that the name had been revealed. There was no answer at two addresses in west London where Emwazi was listed to have lived. Neighbors described the family as “normal people” and “friendly”. “This is the first time anything like this happens in this neighborhood,” said Fatima Al-Baqali. “We have to be careful now. I didn’t know this family and I usually know everyone here.” Qureshi, of the Cage charity which describes itself as having campaigned against the ‘War on Terror’ for more than a decade, said that although he could not be certain Emwazi was John, there were some “striking similarities”. He declined to elaborate. In a meeting with reporters in London, Qureshi painted a picture of a kind and thoughtful young man who faced harassment from MI5, which apparently suspected he wanted to join the Somali Islamist militant group al Shabaab. British authorities have linked Emwazi to another British militant killed in Somalia in a U.S. drone attack.  A British court ruling dated December 2011 reported that Elwazi was an associate of Bilal al Berjawi, a high-ranking leader of the Somali-based militant group al Shabaab, a person in possession of the court ruling said.  Reuters has not seen the original court ruling. Media reports said he helped supervise the recruitment and training of new Shabaab members.  Qureshi said British spies had tried to recruit Emwazi as a source but declined to provide specifics. “There’s one character that I remember, one kind person that I remember and then I see that image and there doesn’t seem to be a correlation between the two,” Qureshi told reporters. “I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London..,” Emwazi wrote in an email to Cage. He felt like “a person imprisoned and controlled by security service men, (who) stopping me from living my new life in my birthplace and my country, Kuwait”. Cage said Emwazi was detained in Tanzania, where he went for a safari holiday with two friends in August 2009. He was deported to Amsterdam and interrogated by MI5 and a Dutch intelligence officer and then sent back to Britain, according to Qureshi. Reuters was unable to immediately verify the version of events given by the charity, which provoked criticism for shifting the responsibility for Emwazi’s crimes. “I think this is an attempt to deflect attention from Jihadi John,” said Shiraz Maher, Senior Fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization, King’s College London.  “They’re trying to lay the blame for this at the feet of the British government,” he told Sky news. The Cage charity, which also worked with the family of Michael Adebolajo, the Muslim covert who with an accomplice killed a British soldier in London in May 2013, said both men had been victims of undue pressure from the security services. Britain’s MI5 security service was not immediately available for comment on those allegations. MI5 has argued to British lawmakers that it would be damaging to national security to comment on allegations that is sought to recruit Adebolajo. The British Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee said last year that MI5 had investigated Adebolajo five times, twice as a high priority, but had found no evidence that any attack was being planned. The Committee said it had found no evidence that Adebolajo was harassed by MI5. After becoming frustrated following three failed attempts to return to Kuwait, and changing his name to Mohammed al-Ayan, Emwazi left his parents’ home and slipped out of Britain, according to Qureshi. Four months later, police visited the family home to say they had information he had entered Syria. His family thought he was in Turkey doing aid work. “Jihadi John” fronted gruesome Islamic State videos that showed either the killing or bodies of victims including U.S. citizens James Foley, Steven Sotloff and Peter Kassig, Britons David Haines and Alan Henning, Japanese Kenji Goto and over 20 Syrian soldiers.

840,INTC,Intel launches chip for new push into low-price smartphones,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp is shipping new mobile chips that represent the semiconductor company’s biggest hope for making progress in smartphones this year. Responding to a growing market in China for low-cost handsets often priced below $100, Intel announced plans for the chip, code named Sofia, in late 2013 at a meeting with investors.  “We went from PowerPoint to shipping in 15 months,” said Aicha Evans, General Manager of Intel’s Platform Engineering Group. As well as smartphones, the Sofia chip fills a gap in Intel’s lineup of chips for tablets. Over 20 manufactures plan to make devices made with Sofia, with many on display at this week’s Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona, Spain, Evans said. After falling behind in mobile chips, Intel has been rushing to catch up with Qualcomm Inc and Taiwan’s MediaTek Inc. Qualcomm said on Monday it will start testing its newest top-tier smartphone chip, the Snapdragon 820, with manufacturers in late 2015. In a costly strategy that elevated Intel to the No 2 spot in tablet chip market share, Intel last year paid manufacturers some of the engineering cost of developing low-end tablets using another chip, code named Bay Trail, that it originally had designed for more expensive devices.  Intel has declined to say how much it paid tablet makers to use its Bay Trail chips, but it’s mobile unit had a loss of $4.2 billion last year, worse than its $3.1 billion loss in 2013. Intel believes the new Sofia chips are ideal for the fast-growing, low-end smartphone market in Asia and has said it does not plan to use costly subsidies to sell the chips this year. The Sofia chips currently shipping have 3G features for low-end phones, and 4G versions for pricier smartphones will be released later this year, the company added.

841,INTC,Ericsson joins with Intel to help telecoms firms get in the cloud,"BARCELONA (Reuters) - Telecom equipment maker Ericsson and chipmaker Intel have agreed a partnership deal to help network operator customers build datacenters, putting them on a more competitive footing against big, cloud-based Internet firms such as Google, Facebook and Amazon. “We will build datacenter equipment which will actually have the same performance as many of the big cloud providers are doing for themselves,” Ericsson’s chief executive, Hans Vestberg, told a news conference at the Mobile World Congress telecoms trade show in Barcelona on Monday. Ericsson, the world’s leading maker of mobile network equipment, said it will help its global base of major telecoms companies to shift to cloud computing using Intel datacenter designs to compete more actively with Web rivals. No financial terms of the partnership were disclosed. Over the past decade Web-based services like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft have stopped buying finished computers, storage devices and network components and instead developed their own systems in-house to create massive, low-cost datacenters in the cloud to serve billions of users. Ericsson’s partnership with Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, puts it in a crowded market for providing bespoke datacenters, where it will also be competing with a range of technology suppliers including Cisco and IBM.  The Swedish company’s plan is to focus initially on equipping big telecom operators rather than competing for new corporate customers in other industries, its CEO said. Telecom operators are rushing to build datacenters in the cloud to slash the cost of hardware spending within their networks, improve the range of services they offer subscribers and to obtain the Web-wide reach of the big Internet companies. “The difference is that we are going to provide it to the market,” Vestberg said. “This is predominately to see that we give a competitive edge for our customers, the carriers.” The move builds on a number of smaller cloud software company acquisitions made by Ericsson over the past year.

845,INTC,'Jihadi John' part of network linked to failed London bombers: court papers,"LONDON (Reuters) - Islamist militant Mohammed Emwazi, identified as ‘Jihadi John,’ was a  member of a network in contact with one of the men convicted of trying to bomb the British capital’s underground railway in 2005, according to the government.    The man dubbed by British media “Jihadi John” has fronted Islamic State videos from Syria that showed either the killing or bodies of victims including British, U.S. and Japanese citizens and Syrian soldiers. U.S. security sources last week identified the man, who appeared clad in black and brandishing a knife, as Mohammed Emwazi.   The British government’s view is set out in court papers, reviewed by Reuters and publicly available on the Internet, which refer to 2011 and 2013 British legal hearings concerning two of Emwazi’s London associates, known only as Iranian-born “CE” and Ethiopian-born “J1.” The court papers reported in the Observer and Sunday Telegraph newspapers, offer a fleeting glimpse of Emwazi’s life in London before he left for Syria. They show that Emwazi was known to Britain’s security services as early as 2011 and that they believed he was part of a group involved in procuring funds and equipment “for terrorism-related purposes” in Somalia. They show that authorities thought Emwazi was part of a network that numbered at least 12 people. One of the same network’s members, “J1”, spoke on the phone with Hussain Osman, one of the men convicted in connection with an unsuccessful attempt to blow up the London underground in 2005, on the day of the failed attack itself, the papers show. British Islamists killed 52 people in an attack on London’s transport network on July 7, 2005. Another group of Islamists — of which Osman was one — tried and failed to pull off a second attack two weeks later.   Osman, who like “J1” was also born in Ethiopia, was convicted by a London court of conspiracy to murder in 2007 and sentenced to a minimum of 40 years in prison.     The same documents show that “J1”, Emwazi’s associate, was stopped by police in Scotland in 2004 with three others wearing plastic gloves. The men said they were on their way to an area where the authorities said an extremist training camp was being held.  The camp’s organizer, a man identified in court papers only as Hamid, was subsequently convicted of soliciting to murder and of providing terrorism training. Four of the men involved in the failed London bombings had attended a similar camp organized by Hamid earlier that same year, the court papers said. The 2011 court papers pertained to a case between the British government and “CE” over the authorities’ decision to relocate him outside London as a preventative measure.  The 2013 papers referred to an immigration appeal case between the British government and “J1.”  The legal documents came to public attention as a political row over the way Britain handles militants broke out with the opposition Labour Party accusing Prime Minister David Cameron’s government of “tying the hands” of security services with insufficiently robust legislation.  Separately, a dispute flared between Cameron’s Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats — their junior coalition partners — over what guidance should be given to universities to prevent militant preachers spreading their message.  The Liberal Democrats said they wanted to ensure that only people known to be inciting violence, rather than advocating Islamic caliphates, were prevented from debating.

846,INTC,Israel's TowerJazz to produce sensors for Intel's 3D cameras,"TEL AVIV, March 3 (Reuters) - TowerJazz has won a contract from Intel Corp to produce infrared sensors for Intel’s 3D cameras, the Israeli chip manufacturer said on Tuesday. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but a market source who asked not to be named estimates that the agreement could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars within four years. The 3D cameras installed on laptops recognise gestures, enabling users to control their computers with hand and head movements. The technology was developed by Intel’s Israeli subsidiary close to TowerJazz’s manufacturing plant in northern Israel. Avi Strum, general manager of TowerJazz’s CMOS image sensor business, said the technology has numerous potential uses, such as the ability for the likes of cooks or car mechanics to operate a computer with gestures rather than having to touch it with dirty hands. The camera can also capture images of an object and quickly create a model for use in 3D printing. “Intel sensing solutions will bring consumers new experiences and will change the way people capture and share 3D images,” Strum said. “That Intel chose us for mass production of such sensors is very positive.” While gesture control is most common in laptops or gaming systems, it is expected to become more widely used in mobile devices such as smartphones.

849,INTC,Swiss makers quietly gear up with smartwatches of their own,"* Industry starting to think Apple Watch may boost luxury sales * Apple may make watches cool again among the young - analyst * Swiss makers tinkering with smartwatches of their own * Apple threat is most acute for Swatch, analysts say By Martinne Geller and Eric Auchard LONDON/FRANKFURT, March 11 (Reuters) - To observers of the secretive Swiss watch industry, its quiet, seemingly passive response to Apple Inc’s plan to attack their centuries-old business could be mistaken for submission before an overwhelming adversary. But luxury and fashion groups Richemont, LVMH , Swatch Group and Guess Inc have been busy in the past year tinkering with smartwatches of their own, while aiming to preserve their products’ more timeless appeal. When Apple Watch was first announced last September, some experts dismissed such devices as appealing to a different class of customer - those who prize technology over prestige. Now analysts and industry executives are starting to think that maybe the Apple Watch juggernaut will stoke sales of luxury timepieces among younger consumers used to telling the time with their phones, rather than on their wrists. “Apple has the potential to make the watch cool again,” said CCS Insight mobile analyst Ben Wood, a confessed wearable gadget freak. “I think the Swiss watch industry are going to be absolutely delighted.” Swatch - which has dabbled with smartwatch experiments for more than a decade and already makes components for fitness band wearable devices, has told Swiss newspapers it is gearing up to offer smartwatches of its own in the next few months. “Apple is not the only company which is about to toss a smartwatch on the market,” Nick Hayek, chief executive of Swatch, the world’s largest watchmaking group, told SonntagsBlick in January. “This is not a threat but a huge opportunity for us and the Swiss watch industry.” On Monday, Apple revealed that its line-up of watches will go on sale in April. The entry-level Apple Watch Sport will start at $349, the standard version at $549 and the high-end “Edition” watch at $10,000. The upcoming Swatch Smartwatch will include a chip that allows users to make contactless payments with a swipe of the wrist. It will use long-lasting batteries and work with both Apple and Google-based phones, according to news reports. While the Apple Watch has drawn rave reviews for many of its features, its limited battery life of no more than 18 hours before re-charging is considered a big drawback. The threat of the smartwatch may also be limited due to its short shelf life as a hi-tech, frequently upgraded product. An iPhone tends to lose half its value within the first year after it is introduced, while Rolex’s flagship Submariner model has risen in value, analysts at Berenberg Bank noted in a recent report. Montblanc, owned by Richemont, announced in January the launch of the TimeWalker Urban Speed e-strap watch, which combines a traditional mechanical watch with an interchangeable strap containing a Bluetooth connected device. That offers “the best of both worlds”, according to Berenberg’s luxury goods analyst, Bassel Choughari. He said this is less risky than the strategy of LVMH’s Tag Heuer, which has partnered with an as-yet-undisclosed U.S. tech company to produce a watch outside Switzerland. “It creates a bit of a grey area between Swiss-made and probably made-in-China products, so that could be a bit difficult to manage over time,” Choughari said of the danger to brands. Guess Inc has also announced plans to launch a smartwatch line called Guess Connect later this year. The new models, which come in sporty and jewel-encrusted versions, will link wirelessly to a user’s nearby Apple or Google Android smartphone. Guess says these will be compatible with thousands of existing mobile phone apps and can be controlled from the watch using voice activated commands. Fossil Group, another U.S.-based fashion group, has toyed with smartwatches since 2003. A year ago, it said it would produce a smartwatch based on Google’s Android Wear software, and in September, it said it had partnered with chipmaker Intel Corp. It too early to know whether the Apple Watch, whose price tags run as high as $17,000 for its yellow or rose gold models, will steal share from the Swiss industry, which sells about 30 million watches a year. The threat that Apple will cannibalise existing watch demand is most acute for Swatch, analysts say, because it has the highest proportion of products selling for a few hundred dollars, instead of several thousands as high-end names do. If Apple sells 20 million watches in the first year, as some analysts estimate, and all of those purchases divert buyers from other watch brands, Swatch could suffer a 6 percent hit to annual revenue, according to a calculation by Barclays analysts. Watch connoisseur Steve Baktidy says he is interested in the Apple Watch but only as a tech gadget to play with. But he also welcomed efforts by luxury makers to introduce more tech features of their own. “Absolutely I’ll buy one (from Apple) but it’s not going to replace my everyday watch,” said Baktidy, owner of two auto body repair shops in New York and two dozen watches by luxury brands including Patek Philippe, Audemars Piguet, Breitling and Omega.

850,INTC,Wall St. bounces back in broad rally; bank shares gain,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose in a broad rally on Thursday, bouncing back from two days of losses, helped by weaker retail sales that paused the dollar’s recent rally and tempered the outlook for interest rates. The day’s gains lifted the Dow and S&P; 500 back into positive territory for the year so far.  Banking shares rallied following the Federal Reserve’s annual check-up on the industry’s health. The S&P; financial sector .SPSY rose 2.2 percent and was the day’s biggest gainer. A weak outlook from Intel, however, limited gains in the tech sector. Retail sales unexpectedly dropped for a third month in February, which helped the euro rebound from a 12-year low versus the dollar. Recent weakness in stocks has largely been driven by Friday’s stronger-than-expected jobs data, which underscored views the Fed could raise rates as early as June.  “To me, it shows maybe that moving the rate increase closer has potential fallout with regard to the ever-stronger U.S. dollar, and that’s a headwind for growth and a headwind for earnings for a lot of companies that do business outside the U.S.,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T; Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 259.83 points, or 1.47 percent, to 17,895.22, while the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 25.71 points, or 1.26 percent, to 2,065.95. The day's percentage gains were the biggest for both the Dow and S&P; 500 in about a month. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 43.35 points, or 0.89 percent, to 4,893.29. The rally represented just a partial rebound after a recent bout of weakness, which has left the S&P; 500 down 2.4 percent from its March 2 record closing high. Citigroup (C.N) passed in the Fed review, allowing it to raise dividends and sending shares up 3.3 percent to $54.08. Bank of America (BAC.N) was told to get a better grip on internal controls and its data models; shares slipped 0.1 percent to $16.09. Intel Corp (INTC.O) slashed its first-quarter revenue forecast, citing lower-than-expected demand for business PCs and lower inventory levels across the PC supply chain. Shares of the Dow component fell 4.7 percent to $30.80 and limited the Nasdaq’s advance.  Shares of Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) rose 4.2 percent to $107.17 and were the biggest percentage gainer in the Dow after it said it has started work on a sequel to “Frozen,” the best-selling animated movie of all time.

851,INTC,CORRECTED-UPDATE 4-Intel cuts revenue forecast as desktop demand weakens,"(Corrects paragraph 5 to say “smartphones”, not “laptops and tablets”) * Expects 1st-qtr rev of $12.8 bln, plus or minus $300 mln * Earlier forecast $13.7 bln, plus or minus $500 mln * Shares fall more than 5 pct By Anya George Tharakan and Sai Sachin R March 12 (Reuters) - Intel Corp slashed nearly $1 billion from its first-quarter revenue forecast as small businesses put off upgrading their personal computers, sending the chipmaker’s shares down more than 5 percent. Fewer companies than Intel had expected replaced desktop PCs running on outdated Microsoft operating systems, leading to weak demand for its chips. Intel also cited “challenging” macroeconomic and currency conditions, particularly in Europe. “The macro environment is not robust enough for people to upgrade their PCs the way they normally would,” Topeka Capital Markets analyst Suji De Silva said. Intel said on Thursday that it expected first-quarter revenue of $12.8 billion, plus or minus $300 million - about 7 percent lower than its earlier forecast of $13.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Though dominant in the market for chips used in PCs, Intel has been slower than rivals such as Qualcomm Inc to adjust in recent years to the growing popularity of smartphones. When Microsoft Corp wound down support for its Windows XP operating system last April, Intel had expected a bounce in demand from small- and medium-sized businesses. But this has not happened. Businesses and consumers are taking an “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” attitude to their old PCs, Summit Research analyst Srini Sundararajan said. According to BlueFin Research Partners, 75 million-76 million PCs will be shipped worldwide in the first quarter, a decline of 8-9 percent from the preceding quarter. Intel, whose historic “Wintel” alliance with Microsoft once delivered breathtakingly high profit margins, has been trying to offset the impact of slower PC upgrades by making chips for devices such as “2-in-1s”, which function as both laptop and tablet. Intel said the mid-point of its gross margin range would remain at 60 percent, plus or minus a couple of percentage points. Intel’s shares were down 4.8 percent at $30.76 in late afternoon trading on the Nasdaq. Microsoft’s shares were down 2.4 percent at $41. Shares of ASML Holding NV, the world’s largest maker of semiconductor production equipment, were down 2 percent at $104.40.

855,INTC,Fitch: Intel Outlook Could Signal PC Market Hasn't Stabilized,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 12 (Fitch) Intel's negative pre-announcement this morning  suggests the end of support for Windows XP was a more significant factor than  previously estimated in last year's perceived stabilizing personal computer (PC)  demand, according to Fitch Ratings. Consequently, extended PC refresh cycles may  result in a resumption of negative PC sales growth. Intel Thursday changed its first-quarter revenue outlook as a function of weaker  than expected PC demand. Intel now expects $12.8 billion in first-quarter  revenue versus its prior $13.7 billion projection. We believe expectations for sustained negative PC sales growth could pressure  ratings or outlooks for technology companies for which stabilizing PC demand is  a key base case assumption, including Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (B-/Stable),  Dell Corp. (BB/Positive) and Hewlett-Packard Company (A-/Negative Watch).  While Intel and Microsoft are negatively affected, Fitch believes both companies  have significant financial flexibility at their respective current ratings to  weather weaker PC demand as each continues to shift focus toward growth markets.  Fitch now expects negative low-single-digit PC unit growth for 2015, driven by  the resumption of an extended PC refresh cycle and consumer substitution of  smartphones and tablets for PCs more than offsetting solid demand around the  data center. These secular trends were clouded in 2014 by the end of support for  Windows XP, resulting in only slightly lower PC unit growth for the year.

860,INTC,"Tag Heuer, Intel challenge Apple with Android smartwatch","BASEL, Switzerland (Reuters) - Tag Heuer, French luxury group LVMH’s (LVMH.PA) biggest watch maker, said it will launch a smartwatch later this year using Google Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Android operating system in a venture with Intel Corp (INTC.O) to compete head-on with the Apple Watch. Tag Heuer Chief Executive Jean-Claude Biver declined to give any details about pricing, functionality or design, but said on Thursday that it aimed to launch what would be the first Android luxury smartwatch in the fourth quarter. The Apple Watch is due to go on sale on April 24 and will range in price from $350 to $17,000 for an 18-karat gold model. It is the company’s first major new product in five years and consumer demand for the device is being closely watched by competitors and investors.   The device needs an Apple iPhone to work fully, and analysts say the most likely pool of initial buyers will already have an Apple smartphone in their pockets. “We believe wearable technology will take off,” Michael Bell, vice president of Intel’s New Devices unit, said at a news conference with Tag Heuer at the Baselworld watch and jewellery fair. Intel struck partnerships with several consumer goods companies last year to develop smart wearable products, including eyewear brand Oakley, owned by Luxottica (LUX.MI), watchmaker Fossil (FOSL.O), and U.S. fashion brand Opening Ceremony. “Tag Heuer’s decision to partner with technology companies to deliver a smartwatch ... will likely be the first of many similar deals,” Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, said. “With Apple Watch hitting the market it’s no longer viable for Swiss watchmakers to bury their heads in the sand. Now Tag Heuer has signalled its intention to enter the smartwatch market we are certain others will follow.” Gucci said on Thursday that it would develop a smartband with i.am+ whose functions would include phone calls, text messages, emails and music.

Marc Hayek, who heads Swatch Group UHR.VX watch brands Breguet, Jaquet Droz and Blancpain, joined the chorus of luxury executives alongside Hermes (HRMS.PA) and Patek Philippe who said they had no plans to launch a smartwatch. “The Apple Watch is not a real watch but a consumer electronic,” he told Reuters in Basel on Thursday.

863,INTC,UPDATE 1-Chip designer ARM sees 20 pct market share in servers by 2020,"* Sees share rising from less than 1 pct * Increase in data traffic to push up demand * Chips would be priced less than leader Intel’s   (Adds details, quotes) By Michael Gold TAIPEI, March 19 (Reuters) - British chip design firm ARM Holdings PLC said on Thursday its market share in servers may touch around 20 percent by 2020, up from less than 1 percent now, citing massive potential in the market for big data. “This is a nascent market primed for growth,” Ian Thornton, vice president of investor relations, told reporters and analysts during a briefing in Taipei. The company’s chip designs are used in 90 percent of all smartphones worldwide, including those from Apple Inc. It earns royalties from every chip sold. The first servers sporting ARM-designed server chips were shipped in the fourth quarter from Hewlett-Packard Co. As firms like Google Inc and China’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd collect and transmit more data, the need for servers to store that data will skyrocket. Thornton said Intel Corp currently holds a more-than 90 percent share in server chips and that ARM would market its chip designs more cheaply than its main rival in this segment. “The average selling price of an Intel server chip is about $600” versus $100 to $200 dollars for the equivalent ARM chip, Thornton said. Because there is no serious competitor at the moment, “Intel can charge what they like.” Thornton also said he sees ARM’s overall royalties growing by 22 percent this year.

865,INTC,"Intel in talks to buy Altera, shares of firms surge","(Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) is in talks to buy fellow chipmaker Altera Corp (ALTR.O) in a deal likely to top $10 billion, according to a source familiar with the matter, making it Intel’s biggest purchase ever and the latest merger in the quickly consolidating semiconductor sector. The acquisition of Altera, which makes programmable chips widely used in cellphone towers, the military and other industrial applications, would underscore Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich’s determination to expand into new markets as the personal computer industry loses steam.  Though dominant in the market for chips used in PCs, the world’s biggest chipmaker has been slower than its rivals to adjust in recent years to the growing popularity of smartphones. Earlier this month, Intel slashed nearly $1 billion from its first-quarter revenue forecast to $12.8 billion, plus or minus $300 million, as small businesses put off upgrading their personal computers. Shares of Altera shot up about 28 percent after the talks were first reported by the Wall Street Journal, closing at $44.39 per share on the Nasdaq. Intel shares also gained on the news, rising 6.4 percent to $32. Shares of Xilinx, Altera’s main rival, closed up 6 percent. “On the surface, Altera is one of the only semiconductor companies with better gross margins than Intel, and with about two-thirds of its revenue from telecom, wireless, military/aerospace, it definitely fits the bill of diversifying revenue beyond Intel’s legacy computer markets,” said Cowen & Co analyst Timothy Arcuri, in a note to clients.      Intel declined to comment on the report. An Altera spokesman also declined to comment.    Any deal for Altera, valued at $10.4 billion at Thursday’s close and more than $13 billion after trading ended on Friday, would easily surpass Intel’s previous biggest deal, its $7.7 billion purchase of security software maker McAfee in 2011. Altera’s value to Intel is its programmable chips, which are increasingly being used in data centers, where they are customized for specialized functions such as providing web-search results or updating social networks.  Intel, based in Santa Clara, California, has already been manufacturing chips on behalf of the smaller company since 2013, a major change for Intel, which traditionally has been unwilling to share its cutting-edge technology.  Demand for cheaper chips and new products to power Internet-connected gadgets is driving consolidation in the industry. Features such as WiFi or Bluetooth that once required chips sold by separate companies can now be squeezed onto single pieces of silicon. Deals in the chip sector have been expected after NXP Semiconductors’ (NXPI.O) $12 billion purchase of Freescale Semiconductor FSL.N was announced earlier this month.

867,INTC,Big win for Altera call buyers on talk of Intel deal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - News that chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) is in talks to buy Altera Corp (ALTR.O) sparked a flurry of trades in its short-term calls and could spell huge gains for some timely buyers of the options.  Altera’s shares jumped as much as 30 percent to a high of $45 on a Wall Street Journal report of talks toward a deal. Trading in Altera’s call options, that give the right to buy the shares at a fixed price at a future date, jumped on the news. “Call buyers surfaced just as the story broke,” said Fred Ruffy, options strategist at WhatsTrading.com. About 3,000 Altera calls at the $36 strike price and set to expire on April 17 traded for 35 cents. These traded at 15:32 p.m. EDT (1932 GMT), just as Altera shares began to spike. The calls last traded at $4, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Since each options contract represents 100 shares of the underlying stock, the trader would have paid about $105,000 for the 3000 calls. These were worth roughly $1.2 million by the close of trading, according to Thomson Reuters data. Calls betting on the shares rising above $37 by April 17 also attracted activity at the same time with nearly 1,900 trading. These traded for 15 to 20 cents and closed at $8.

The Wall Street Journal reported chipmaker Intel Corp  is in talks to buy rival Altera Corp, citing people familiar with the matter, sending the PHLX semiconductor index up 2.8 percent. Intel shares jumped 6.4 percent to $32 as the biggest boost to the Dow, S&P; 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes. Altera shares surged 28.4 percent to $44.39. “We’ve seen a lot of M&A; news recently and it’s helping the market,” said Stephen Massocca, chief investment officer at Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco. “There is definitely an M&A; cycle going on, so that is a good thing.” Equity markets were largely unfazed by Fed Chair Janet Yellen’s comments at a monetary policy conference in San Francisco. She said the U.S. Federal Reserve is giving “serious consideration” to beginning to reduce its accommodative monetary policy and a rate hike may be warranted later this year, although a downturn in core inflation or wage growth could force it to hold off. “I don’t think there is anything new or different here,” said Massocca. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 34.43 points, or 0.19 percent, to 17,712.66, the S&P; 500 gained 4.87 points, or 0.24 percent, to 2,061.02 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 27.86 points, or 0.57 percent, to 4,891.22. Healthcare also helped buoy indexes as biotech stocks  bounced 1.9 percent higher after suffering a 7-percent drop in the prior four sessions, while energy was the worst performing S&P; sector as crude prices resumed their decline. Investors have been cautious ahead of the start of earnings season, as traders look to see how much the strong U.S. dollar will hurt corporations’ bottom lines. For the week, the S&P; 500 fell 2.2 percent, the Dow lost 2.3 percent and the Nasdaq declined 2.7 percent. U.S. consumer sentiment fell month-over-month in March, a survey released on Friday showed, though the decline was smaller than forecast. The final reading of gross domestic product for the last quarter of 2014 was unchanged at a 2.2 percent rate of expansion. After-tax corporate profits fell at a 1.6 percent rate in the fourth quarter as a strong dollar dented the earnings of multinationals.

Despite that, energy shares could come under pressure as crude oil fell on a possible deal with Iran, which could bring an end to sanctions and allow an increase in the country’s oil exports. Crude oil fell 0.5 percent to $48.68 per barrel after falling as 2.5 percent earlier in the session. Separately, an increase in the U.S. dollar could weigh on multi-nationals.

Shares in Infineon, STMicroelectronics, ARM and ASML were up 2.3 percent to 3.2 percent. U.S. tech stocks climbed on Friday after news that Intel Corp is in talks to buy fellow chipmaker Altera Corp  in a deal likely to top $10 billion. Intel shares jumped 6.4 percent while Altera shares surged 28.4 percent. Shares in French cement group Lafarge bucked the trend on Monday, down 2 percent after two shareholders of its Swiss merger partner Holcim appeared unhappy with revised deal terms that were designed to placate them. Holcim shares were up 0.3 percent. Shares in Italy’s World Duty Free sank 8.1 percent after Swiss group Dufry offered 10.25 euros a share to buy the travel retailer, below Friday’s closing price. Dufry was up 4.4 percent. Greek shares dipped, with Athens’s ATG index falling 1.4 percent after Greece and its international creditors continued talks through the weekend on reforms to unlock loans and Athens sounded an upbeat tone, and the lenders said it could take several more days before a proper list of measures was ready. At 0751 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 1.2 percent at 1,597.12 points, after losing 2 percent last week. “Last week, the market took a little breather, but there was no ‘sell’ signal. We would need a bigger retracement to break the market’s positive trend,” said Jean-Louis Cussac, head of Perceval Finance. “On the upside, there are no big resistance levels in sight, so the best thing to do is just to follow the trend for now.” A renewed fall in the euro also helped fuel appetite for European stocks on Monday. The dollar inched higher versus the euro after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen signalled that the U.S. central bank will likely start raising borrowing costs later this year, but emphasized the return to normal interest rates will be gradual. European stocks have strongly rallied since the start of the year as investors bet a fall in the euro would help revive the region’s economic growth and corporate profits. The euro is down about 20 percent against the dollar over the past year, which is set to give euro zone companies a major lift as roughly 50 percent of their earnings come from outside the region, while the stronger dollar is set to hurt U.S. company results. According to data from a Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research, European equity funds attracted $5.4 billion in net investment flows last week, marking their 11th straight week of inflows, while U.S.-focused stock funds posted $10.8 billion in outflows. Also helping sentiment on Monday, weekend comments from Chinese central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan reinforced expectations for further monetary easing to support the country’s slowing economy.

879,INTC,"Charities that funded Cage, one time supporter of IS's Emwazi, under pressure","LONDON (Reuters) - (This story corrects name in paragraph 18 to Network for Social Change, from Network for Social Change Charitable Trust to March 4 story) The financial backers of a campaign group that had contact with the man later known as ‘Jihadi John’ are under pressure from British politicians and a regulator’s investigation to explain why they gave it several hundred thousand pounds. The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, a Quaker foundation, and The Roddick Foundation, set up by the late founder of beauty retailer Body Shop, are among those now being asked how they came to fund Cage, a small activist group that called Mohammed Emwazi, killer of American, British and Syrian hostages, a once “beautiful young man”. “I condemn anybody who attempts to excuse that barbarism away in the way that has been done by Cage,” British interior minister Theresa May told parliament in response to the comment by Cage’s research boss Asim Qureshi to media last week. Cage was set up by a group of London Muslims with the aim of supporting British suspects being held by the United States in Guantanamo Bay. Its activists blame U.S. and British foreign policy for radicalizing Muslims and accuse the security services of harassing those who refuse to be informants. Britain’s Charity Commission, a government-backed regulator, has launched an investigation into whether Cage’s funders had ensured that their money was only used for purposes in line with their objectives. The Commission said in a statement on Monday that it had compliance cases open into the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Foundation and the Roddick Foundation. “In both cases the commission’s regulatory concerns revolve around how the trustees have ensured that charitable grants made to non-charitable bodies are only used for exclusively charitable purposes in line with their objects,” it said. The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust said in a statement that it had made three grants to Cage in 2007, 2008 and 2011, making a combined total of 305,000 pounds. It said its last grant payment to them was in January 2014. The Roddick Foundation, set up to “support those who change the world”, gave Cage 35,000 pounds a year in the financial years ending in March 2012 and 2013, and 25,000 pounds a year in the financial years ending in March 2010 and 2011, according to accounts made public by the Charity Commission. The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust said it stood by its funding. “We believe (Cage) has played an important role in highlighting the ongoing abuses at Guantanamo Bay and at many other sites around the world, including many instances of torture,” it said in a statement. The Roddick Foundation could not be reached for comment as its listed phone number was disconnected and emails to its public email address bounced back. Attempts to reach trustee Gordon Roddick via other organizations to which he is connected yielded no response. The relationship between Emwazi and Cage began in 2009, when he visited its drab office block in a back street behind the East London Mosque. Cage held a news conference last week to publish emails sent to it from Emwazi over several years during which time he complained of being regularly harassed by security services. On its Website, the group says: “Cage has been campaigning against the War on Terror for more than a decade”. Public information about Cage’s finances is scant: It is listed in the UK companies register, but has filed accounts only for 2008 and as a small company it is not obliged to report each year.  According to Qureshi and its website, Cage is a non-profit making company limited by guarantee, a structure without share capital that is usually used to protect the people running the company from personal liability for its debts. The group’s other main funder, according to Qureshi, is the Network for Social Change, which describes itself as “a group of individuals providing funding for progressive social change”.  The Network for Social Change said its vehicle for donating to non charitable projects, Funding for Social Change Limited, had not funded Cage since 2008. “Funding for Social Change Limited is not and never has been a main funder of Cage,” a spokesperson for the organization said in an email. “It provided Cage with a non-charitable grant of 15,000 pounds in 2008 and has not funded it since.”   A British lawmaker told Reuters all of the charities that had funded Cage should dissociate from it after the group’s comments at last week’s news conference. “It was both extraordinary and disgraceful, they were very clearly coming out as apologists for terrorism... Those that have provided them with support must very seriously question not only their support for Cage but how they got to make such a decision to support an organization like this,” said John Spellar, a spokesman on foreign affairs for the opposition Labour Party. “I think there needs to be some very serious rethinking done by a number of these charities and NGOs about how they got into a position.” Cage’s Qureshi said the group would continue its work regardless of the criticism leveled at it. “Certain media organizations, right-wing think tanks, don’t like our narrative as it goes against the prevailing national security paradigm,” he told Reuters. “Even though we aren’t a proselytizing organization, we are a Muslim response to a problem that largely affects Muslims.” British Prime Minister David Cameron’s spokesman told reporters: “The prime minister thinks that it’s absolutely right that the Charity Commission is undertaking the work that it is with regard to the funding of the organization.” If the cases are escalated to inquiry level, and it is found that wrongdoing has occurred, the trustees of each charity can be suspended, an interim manager could be appointed to run the organization or bank accounts could be frozen, said Sarah Hitchings, press officer at the Charity Commission. She added that the investigation so far had found nothing to suggest that this would happen. Cage’s Qureshi said funding from such organizations paled in comparison with the money from individuals, though he said he did not have the figures available to share with Reuters. “Every year in Ramadan we have a big fundraiser and people come, they pledge their support for the organization and we collect the money from that, it helps keep us going,” he said. “The vast majority (of our money) comes from Muslim communities in the UK,” Qureshi told Reuters. “They love our work. The community trusts us and believes in what we do.” The group’s website invites donors to pledge money online, or arrange for someone to pick up a cash donation. Rafik Aziz, who describes himself as the group’s book keeper, said this arrangement was reached after British banks Barclays and the Cooperative closed the group’s accounts last March in a move he said was triggered by the arrest of Moazzam Begg, Cage’s Outreach Director, who both Britain and the United States have accused of terrorism offences. Begg is the group’s most high-profile figure, who spent nearly three years in the U.S. Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba after being seized in Pakistan in 2002.  In 2014, Begg was charged by British police with terrorism offences including providing training and funding terrorism in Syria. He denied the charges. After being held for seven months in custody and with his trial about to start, the charges against him were dropped. Police said at the time the decision to drop the charges came because new material had come to light which meant police and prosecution lawyers had concluded there was no realistic chance of securing a conviction. Aziz said that since the bank account closures, the group had no success with other banks they approached, though he did not name the banks. In addition to the Charity Commission investigation, Cage said last May that two of its board members were being investigated for fraud and tax evasion, although it did not name them and Reuters was unable to identify them. A spokesman for HMRC (Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs) said that it was unable to confirm or deny any probe was happening due to rules about tax payer confidentiality.

881,INTC,Check Point to buy Israel's Lacoon Mobile Security,"TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Internet and network security provider Check Point Software Technologies will buy Israel-based Lacoon Mobile Security for tens of millions of dollars, it said on Thursday. Lacoon’s product, which helps to prevent cyber attacks on mobile phones and is used by customers including Samsung, Intel and Dell, will be integrated into Check Point’s own mobile security solution, Capsule. Check Point Chief Executive Gil Shwed did not disclose the price but said in a news conference that the deal was in the tens of millions of dollars and will boost his company’s offering in what it expects to become an increasingly important part of the market. “Companies are not necessarily protecting the data on mobile devices properly,” Shwed said in a statement, adding that Check Point’s product will be targeted at enterprises. “We found that Lacoon had the best and most advanced solution to prevent threats.” Shwed said Lacoon, which was founded in 2011 and employs 40 people, can support up to 300,000 mobile devices. “This is our second acquisition in Israel this year and is part of our effort to boost the level of innovation in threat prevention,” he said at Thursday’s news conference.  Israel-based Check Point bought Israeli cyber-security start-up Hyperwise in February and plans to hire 600 workers in Israel this year as it looks to boosting its research and development operations. Israeli newspaper Calcalist reported last month that Check Point was in talks to buy Lacoon for $80 million.

The tweet by Wall Street Journal reporter Dana Mattioli, sent the same minute as the headlines, led to speculation that it may have spurred the timely options trades. The tweet, however, was sent 19 seconds after the initial options trades.

Shares of Exxon Mobil, Chevron and other energy companies followed crude  higher after a forecast that U.S. shale oil output in May would record its first monthly decline in more than four years. The S&P; 500 energy index jumped 1.77 percent. Norfolk Southern Corp dropped 4.18 percent to $100.49 a day after it forecast a surprise drop in its first-quarter earnings and revenue. A strong dollar, cheap oil and poor weather in the eastern United States in recent months have investors bracing for a difficult March-quarter earnings season. First-quarter profits for S&P; 500 companies are seen falling 2.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. On Jan. 1, analysts had been looking for growth of 5.3 percent. Those lowered expectations mean that companies can now more easily impress investors, said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. “This may be one of most hated earnings seasons I remember,” Hogan said. “We’ve taken those three negative headwinds and plowed them as far as we can into the worst-case scenario.” Shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co rose 1.6 percent after the biggest U.S. bank by assets reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit.

After the bell, Intel Corp forecast revenue broadly in line with Wall Street’s low expectations and signaled a hefty cut in capital expenditures this year, sending its shares up 2.6 percent. U.S. railroad CSX Corp reported a higher quarterly net profit and announced a $2 billion share repurchase program, sending its shares 3.43 percent higher in extended trade. During the regular session, Chevron’s shares gained 2.2 percent and Exxon rose 1.5 percent. Nokia Oyj is in talks to buy Alcatel-Lucent SA, a deal that would combine the telecommunications industry’s two weakest players. U.S. shares of Nokia fell 4.09 percent to $7.96 while Alcatel rose 13.33 percent to $4.93. Companies expected to report this week include GE, Philip Morris International Inc and Bank of America Corp .

Oil rose sharply after U.S. government data showed crude oil inventories rose less than expected last week. Better-than-expected results from banks JPMorgan Chase  and Wells Fargo and earnings from Intel  that were broadly in line with expectations boosted Wall Street. First-quarter profits are seen falling 2.6 percent, largely due to weak energy earnings, but the reduced expectations are helping companies clear a lowered bar. “Management has done a good job guiding market expectations to an appropriate level, and now they’re stepping over a lowered bar,” said Alan Gayle, senior investment strategist and director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta, Georgia. “Fundamentals in the equity market remain good.” Brent crude oil prices rose 3 percent to $60.20, while U.S. crude futures closed up 5.8 percent at $56.39 a barrel. U.S. crude inventories rose only 1.3 million barrels to 483.69 million, the smallest build since the week ending Jan. 2, according to the Energy Information Administration. Weak data out of China bolstered expectations of additional monetary stimulus that would likely help risk assets such as equities. The euro bounced around in a volatile session as traders weighed comments from ECB President Mario Draghi after the bank said it expects to continue its asset-purchase program of 60 billion euros a month. The ECB kept interest rates unchanged at record lows. After earlier losses, the euro rebounded, rising to $1.0678 against the dollar, up 0.2 percent. “Our focus will be on the full implementation of our monetary policy measures,” Draghi said. A German auction saw 10-year borrowing costs for the euro zone’s biggest economy reach a record low. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 75.71 points, or 0.42 percent, to 18,112.41, the S&P; 500 gained 10.75 points, or 0.51 percent, to 2,106.59 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 33.73 points, or 0.68 percent, to 5,011.02. Data earlier showed growth in China’s economy slowed to a six-year low of 7 percent in the first quarter, better than many feared after a woeful trade performance in March. But both retail sales and industrial output missed forecasts, intensifying Beijing’s struggle to find the right policy mix to shore up activity. The pan-European Eurofirst 300 index of leading shares  rose 0.6 percent to 1,650.15, its highest since late 2000. News that Finnish telecom equipment maker Nokia  has agreed to buy France’s Alcatel-Lucent helped the push higher. German 10-year borrowing costs, the benchmark for euro zone debt, fell close to zero as a Bund auction showed there were enough private investors willing to compete with the ECB for the top-rated, almost yield-free paper. The yield hit a low of 0.105 percent; the 10-year U.S. yield was at 1.88 percent.

All 10 major S&P; 500 sectors gained, with the energy index  leading, up 2.3 percent. U.S. crude jumped more than 5 percent after a lower-than-expected build of U.S. crude stockpiles. Intel jumped 4.25 percent to $32.83 after the chipmaker said late on Tuesday it expects flat revenue for the entire year despite some weakness in the first quarter. Investors have feared the March-quarter earnings season, just getting under way, would be crippled by low oil prices, a strong dollar and extreme weather in the eastern United States. First-quarter profits for S&P; 500 companies are seen dropping 2.6 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. “Companies can jump over a bar that’s about as low as a limbo stick,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. “Beating expectations should be relatively easy.” Of the 36 companies in the S&P; 500 that have reported so far, 81 percent beat expectations, better than the 63 percent of companies exceeding expectations in a typical quarter. But just 47 percent of companies exceeded revenue expectations, worse than 61 percent seen in a typical quarter. That suggests companies are bolstering their bottom lines by cutting costs instead of by expanding their businesses. U.S. shares also benefited after the European Central Bank said it remained committed to its full asset-buying program to revive the euro zone economy. The strong dollar hurts U.S. companies dependent on overseas sales, while slumping oil prices erode the profits of energy companies. But many industrial and transportation companies benefit from cheap oil and its derivatives. Delta Air Lines  posted first-quarter profit above analysts’ expectations and its stock rose 2.60 percent to end at $44.20. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 75.91 points, or 0.42 percent, to close at 18,112.61. The S&P; 500  gained 10.79 points, or 0.51 percent, to 2,106.63 and the Nasdaq Composite added 33.73 points, or 0.68 percent, to end the day at 5,011.02. Wednesday’s gains bring the Nasdaq to within striking distance of its record-high close of 5,048.62 points set in 2000 during the dot-com boom. Bank of America’s shares ended down 1.14 percent at $15.64. First-quarter profit at the No. 2 U.S. bank by assets narrowly beat analysts’ estimates. After the bell, video streaming company Netflix  posted quarterly results that sent its shares 12 percent higher.

TIG Advisors is the first shareholder to go on the record in a bid to put pressure on Altera. It urged Altera’s shareholders in a letter on Monday to vote against the company’s nomination for lead independent director,  Michael Nevens, at its annual meeting of stockholders scheduled for May 11. Altera did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  “Stockholders should have right to choose between Intel’s reported $54 cash offer and uncertain future of standalone Altera,” TIG Advisors said in a letter to Altera and shareholders. The firm also said it has spoken to many of the “core institutional” shareholders in Altera who also believe $54 is a compelling offer for the company.

908,INTC,Exclusive: Intel's standstill with Altera expires in June - sources,"(Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) signed a standstill agreement earlier this year with Altera Corp (ALTR.O) that expires on June 1, giving the world’s largest chipmaker the option to launch a hostile bid after that, according to sources familiar with the matter. The agreement, disclosed to Reuters by the sources this week, explains why Intel has refrained from launching a tender offer for Altera’s shares once their negotiations broke down. It also underscores the risk Altera faces of such a hostile bid. Earlier this month, Altera rejected an unsolicited $54 per share offer from Intel following months of negotiations, the sources said, asking not to be identified discussing confidential information. They said Altera agreed to engage in these talks on the basis that Intel would not go public with any offer until June.  In February, Intel discussed offering $58 per share for Altera, based on publicly available information it reviewed at the time, according to the people. After signing a non-disclosure agreement and combing through non-public information, including the company’s outlook, it ended up revising down its offer, they said. Last week, Altera posted a sequential 9 percent decline in revenue for the first quarter and said it also expects weakness in its second-quarter guidance, particularly around its wireless business. It is unclear whether Intel would take its proposal directly to shareholders, the sources said, but it remains an option available to it.  Intel and Altera both declined to comment. The acquisition of Altera, which makes programmable chips widely used in cellphone towers and industrial applications and by the military, would underscore Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich’s determination to expand into new markets as the personal computer industry loses steam.

909,INTC,Nvidia wants to leap from video games to self-driving cars,"* Car companies use Nvidia’s “supercomputer on a chip” * Automotive culture invades Silicon Valley * Chipmaker’s rivals include Intel, Texas Instruments * Learning the meaning of “automotive grade” By Paul Lienert DETROIT, May 14 (Reuters) - It took Silicon Valley chipmaker Nvidia Corp the better part of a decade to gain acceptance as a global automotive supplier, a lesson for other technology firms hoping to make a similar transition from consumer electronics to car components. Nvidia had a thriving business in supplying powerful graphics processors for video game consoles and laptop computers when representatives of Volkswagen AG asked if it could adapt the same realistic, three-dimensional displays for the dashboards of Audi luxury cars. That was 10 years ago - several lifetimes in Silicon Valley terms, but just a couple of model changes ago for the big car maker. It took six years for Nvidia to develop the chips to power the 3-D navigation system display that launched on the 2011 Audi A8, the brand’s top-of-the-line sedan, compared with three to four years to develop a new chip for gaming applications. Along the way, Nvidia engineers learned the hard way they could not just pop a chip designed for a laptop or a game console into a car. “We had to be taught what ‘automotive grade’ meant,” recalls Danny Shapiro, Nvidia’s senior director of automotive operations. In simple terms, that meant no reboots - because a dashboard screen that fails to light up means an angry customer and possibly an expensive warranty repair. The decade-long effort enabled Nvidia to make the jump from the world of computers and game consoles into the fast-growing market for advanced automotive displays and automated driving systems. It is a leap that other Silicon Valley tech companies want to emulate to cash in on the convergence of automobiles and digital connectivity. Nvidia’s success in landing processors on cars including the Audi A8 and the Tesla Model S sedan illustrates the growing willingness among automakers to look beyond their traditional suppliers to obtain a technological edge. “They offer us computing systems with the strength” to process vast amounts of data required by new driver assistance systems and displays, said Ulrich Hackenberg, Audi’s head of technical development. Nvidia is still a niche player with a long way to go to crack the top league of traditional automotive chip suppliers. Much larger companies, including Japan’s Renesas Electronics Corp and U.S. chipmakers Texas Instruments Inc, Intel Corp and Qualcomm Inc, dominate the automotive chip business. Nvidia’s automotive sales represented just 4 percent of the company’s $4.7 billion annual revenue in its most recent fiscal year. That in turn is just one-tenth of the $1.86 billion in automotive semiconductors that Texas Instruments sold last year. Brooke Williams, TI’s business manager for driver assistance systems, said his company already knows how to deal with automakers’ demands after 35 years of supplying products for vehicles. “We understand the automotive design cycle and how the vehicle manufacturers and suppliers work.” SELF-DRIVING CARS Nvidia has made the leap to infotainment systems in vehicles, but not yet to self-driving cars. The company had just $23 million in sales in the automotive segment in 2011. Growth has surged since. This year, the company expects automotive revenue of $183 million, and says it has booked more than $2 billion in future automotive business, most of that involving chips for digital displays and infotainment. By 2020, Nvidia expects to have chips on more than 32 million vehicles. The company is pushing to crack the emerging market for driver assistance systems, which include such tasks as self-parking and semi-automated steering and braking. Those systems require huge amounts of computing power in very small packages. Nvidia has developed and begun selling a chip called the Tegra X1 for automotive and gaming uses, which it says can put the power of a supercomputer in a package about the size of a postage stamp. “Nvidia brings unparalleled graphics capabilities that could prove critical building blocks” for driver assistance systems, said Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore. Nvidia got coaching from automotive customers who liked the company’s technology but were not sure of its ability to measure up to their standards. Early in their relationship, Audi executives took Nvidia engineers on a trip to Audi’s home factory in Ingolstadt, Germany. “We told the Nvidia guys, ‘you make one part, but we assemble a car here from 10,000 pieces,’” said Mathias Halliger, Audi’s senior systems architect for connected vehicle technologies. “If even one part is bad, we have a problem.” To drive home the point, an Audi tour guide noted that one of the luxury cars had been rejected because of a tiny flaw in the paint. The plant tour, Halliger said, “helped Nvidia to understand our requirements. It showed dramatically what we were looking for.” There was more for Nvidia to learn. A typical automotive production cycle can run five years or more, compared with one year for many consumer products. Nvidia had to go back to its suppliers to make sure that key components, from memory to power supply, could be upgraded as needed over that longer life cycle. “When you work with car companies and you engage in these developments with them, over the years you adopt their culture,” said Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jen-Hsun Huang, whose personal automotive stable includes two Ferraris and two Teslas.  “But the car is dying to be reinvented.”   (Editing by Joe White and Matthew Lewis)",5142015,http://www.reuters.com/article/nvidia-autos/nvidia-wants-to-leap-from-video-games-to-self-driving-cars-idUSL2N0XE11L20150514

The S&P; 500  racked up its third straight all-time high close, gaining 6.47 points, or 0.3 percent, to end at 2,129.2 points. The Dow rose 26.32 points, or 0.14 percent, to end at 18,298.88, beating its previous record close of 18,288.63 from March 2. U.S. homebuilder sentiment fell in May although most builders view market conditions as favorable, the National Association of Home Builders said on Monday. Slowing economic expansion in recent months, stemming partly from a stronger dollar and sluggish wage growth, has led many investors to push back expectations about when the Fed will begin raising interest rates for the first time since 2006. “It’s becoming more of the collective thought that the Fed can wait, because you really don’t see any blistering growth,” said Kurt Brunner, a portfolio manager at Swarthmore Group in Philadelphia. Apple’s shares rose 1.10 percent to $130.19 after  Carl Icahn, one of the iPhone maker’s top 10 shareholders, said the stock was “still dramatically undervalued” and that it should be trading at $240. The Nasdaq Composite added 30.15 points, or 0.6 percent, to end at 5,078.44. Apple’s rise was the biggest factor for the rise in the three major indexes. Seven of the 10 major S&P; 500 sectors were higher, with the financial index’s 0.56 percent gain leading the way. Sentiment got a boost from talk of mergers and acquisitions. Altera rose 5.65 percent to $46.93 after the New York Post reported the company had resumed talks with Intel  on a possible deal. Intel rose 1.24 percent. Endo International fell 5.37 percent to $80.77 after the generic drugmaker said it would buy privately held Par Pharmaceutical from TPG Capital in a $8.05 billion deal. Alibaba fell 1.53 percent after a group of luxury goods makers sued the company on Friday, contending that the Chinese e-commerce giant knowingly made it possible for counterfeiters to sell their products throughout the world. With Monday’s advances, the Dow is up 2.7 percent year to date, the S&P; 500 is 3.4 percent higher and the Nasdaq is 7.2 percent stronger. The S&P; now trades at 17 times expected earnings, expensive compared to its 10-year median of 15. Relatively light trading volume suggests recent gains may not be resilient, especially as the market approaches summer months when many on Wall Street takes time off, said Brunner. About 5.3 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.4 billion average this month, according to BATS Global Markets. During the session, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,577 to 1,428, for a 1.10-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,719 issues rose and 1,014 fell for a 1.70-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.

The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market index fell to 54 from 56 the month before. Economists polled by Reuters had predicted the index would rise to 57. The U.S. economy is struggling to rebound strongly enough for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates before September, analysts have said. “Right now with the way things are going, especially with the yield curve getting steeper, it’s going to be less and less likely the Fed will raise rates in September,” John Burke, CEO of Burke Financial Strategies in New York. “It looks to be at the very end of the year or maybe even early 2016.” Data released on Friday showed that industrial output slipped and consumer sentiment fell. The S&P; gained 0.08 percent to close at a record high of 2,122.73, modestly exceeding its previous peak on April 24. The Federal Reserve could look at a rate hike in June if the economy is strong enough, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said on Monday, although he argued for rates to start rising in early 2016. Half of the 10 major S&P; 500 sectors were down, with the consumer staples index weighing the most with a 0.42 percent fall. Procter & Gamble was the biggest drag on the index with a 0.6 percent fall.

920,INTC,Intel close to deal to buy Altera for $16 billion: sources,"(Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) has resumed negotiations to buy smaller chip maker Altera Corp (ALTR.O) and is close to a $16 billion acquisition agreement, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. The price for Altera could be as much as $54 per share, a 15 percent premium over its Thursday closing price of $46.97. That would value Altera at more than $16 billion, according to one of the people. Altera shares were up 4.2 percent at $48.96 during Friday morning trading in New York. The deal could be reached in the coming days, the sources said, cautioning that no agreement was certain and asking not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Intel and Altera did not respond to requests for comment. In April, Altera rejected an unsolicited $54 per share offer from Intel following months of negotiations, sources told Reuters at the time. Earlier this year, Intel signed a standstill agreement with Altera that expires on June 1, giving the world’s largest chipmaker the option to launch a hostile bid after that, Reuters reported in April. Avago Technologies Ltd (AVGO.O) agreed on Thursday to buy Broadcom Corp BRCM.O for $37 billion, in the largest merger of chipmakers ever. The New York Post first reported late Thursday that Intel and Altera had restarted talks.

Baker May 29 (Reuters) - Intel Corp has resumed talks to buy programmable-chip maker Altera Corp and is close to a $16 billion deal, people familiar with the matter said on Friday, paving way for the third mega semiconductor-chip deal this year. The price for Altera could be as much as $54 per share, according to one of the people. This would be a 15 percent premium over the stock’s Thursday close of $46.97. If the deal were to go through, it would be Intel’s largest, topping its $7.7 billion purchase of security software maker McAfee in 2011. It would also underscore Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich’s determination to expand into new markets as the personal computer industry - the company’s mainstay - loses steam. The deal will allow Intel to bundle its own server chips with Altera’s line of programmable chips, which are increasingly being used in data centers and are customized for functions such as providing quicker web-searches. “It’s a good deal essentially because it sews up Intel’s data center supremacy even more,” Summit Research analyst Srini Sundararajan said. Intel, since 2013, had been manufacturing chips for Altera, which does not have a foundry. The partnership was unusual for Intel, which has traditionally been unwilling to share its cutting-edge technology. Intel made an unsolicited $54 per share offer for Altera in April, but was rejected, sources had told Reuters. “I think Altera was essentially trying to exploit the fact that Intel really needed them,” Sundararajan said. Intel and Altera signed a standstill agreement earlier this year that expires on June 1, giving the world’s largest chipmaker the option to launch a hostile bid after that, Reuters reported last month. News of the renewed takeover attempt comes on the heels of Avago Technologies Ltd’s $37 billion offer for Broadcom Corp  - the largest merger of chipmakers ever. The fragmented chip industry has been expected to consolidate since NXP Semiconductors said in March it would buy Freescale Semiconductor for $12 billion. Altera shares were up 4.6 percent at $49.18 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq. Intel shares were up 1.3 percent. The deal could be reached in the coming days, the sources said, cautioning that no agreement was certain and asking not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Intel and Altera did not respond to requests for comment. The New York Post first reported late Thursday that Intel and Altera had restarted talks.

922,INTC,US STOCKS-Wall St slips on weak economic data,"* GDP revised to show economy contracted in Q1 * Consumer sentiment, PMI fall in May * Humana hits record on takeover interest, insurers gain * Altera hits 15-year high on report on Intel interest * Indexes down: Dow 0.36 pct, S&P; 0.24 pct, Nasdaq 0.11 pct   (Updates prices) By Sweta Singh May 29 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were lower in early afternoon trading on Friday, weighed by data that showed the economy contracted in the first quarter and as weak data for May added to concerns about the strength of a recovery. The economy contracted at a 0.7 percent annual rate in the quarter, a sharp turnaround from an earlier estimate of growth of 0.2 percent. Weak data on factory activity in the Midwest and consumer sentiment for May, suggested that the growth pace was modest early in the second quarter. That mirrored other recent soft data on retail sales and industrial production. The economy appears poised for its worst first-half performance since 2011. “The data is telling us that the economy is improving but it is not super strong,” said Kim Forrest, a senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. The pace of the recovery will add to investor’s concerns about the timing of an increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve. “Today’s market action says the rate increase is going to happen in September,” Forrest added. Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York, however, ruled out the threat of an imminent interest rate increase, which should be supportive of stocks. “There is no need for the Fed to raise rates now. The economy simply is not strong enough and that’s what today’s data tells us,” Sarhan said. The GDP report also showed that corporate profits declined 8.7 percent in the first quarter, the largest drop in a year. Conflicting reports on Greece’s ability to strike a deal with its euro zone partners also weighed on global markets. At 13:44 p.m. ET (1744 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  was down 64.96 points, or 0.36 percent, at 18,061.16, the S&P; 500 was down 5.09 points, or 0.24 percent, at 2,115.7 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 5.80 points, or 0.11 percent, at 5,092.17. Eight of the 10 S&P; 500 sectors were down. The biggest drop was the industrial sector’s 0.71 percent, with United Rental’s 6.5 percent fall to $88.85 leading the losers after Bank of America Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock. Humana jumped as much as 18 percent to hit a record of $210.65 after the Wall Street Journal reported that the health insurer had received takeover interest. Other health insurers also rose. Intel was up 1.4 percent to $34.49 after the New York Post reported that it was close to buying Altera  for about $15 billion. Altera rose as much as 6.1 percent to a more than 15-year high of $50.10. ITT Educational Services more than doubled to $4.85 after the for-profit education provider reported higher-than-expected annual results. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,924 to 1,033, for a 1.86-to-1 ratio on the downside. On the Nasdaq, 1,449 issues fell and 1,200 advanced for a 1.21-to-1 ratio favoring decliners. The S&P; 500 index showed 14 new 52-week highs and seven new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 64 new highs and 26 new lows.

923,INTC,CORRECTED-UPDATE 5-Avago to buy Broadcom for $37 bln in biggest-ever chip deal,"(Corrects name in final paragraph to Foerster from Forester) * To pay Broadcom shareholders $17 bln in cash, $20 bln in shares * Combined company to have annual revenue of $15 bln * Broadcom, Avago shares slip after big rise on Wednesday By Liana B. Baker and Supantha Mukherjee May 28 (Reuters) - Avago Technologies Ltd agreed on Thursday to buy Broadcom Corp for $37 billion in the largest merger of chipmakers ever, turning a lesser known company run by a ferocious dealmaker into one of the biggest industry players. Avago, which serves the wireless and industrial markets, is offering Broadcom shareholders $17 billion in cash and Avago shares valued at $20 billion. Broadcom is best known for its connectivity chips, which are used widely in smartphones made by Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. The deal is the biggest so far by Avago Chief Executive Hock Tan, who has developed a small chipmaker into a $36 billion company through acquisitions since taking the helm nine years ago. Tan, a serial deal-maker, has trimmed Avago’s portfolio by divesting units while bulking up in faster-growing areas. The combined company, to be based in Singapore and known as Broadcom, will be the third-largest U.S. semiconductor maker by revenue, behind Intel Corp and  Qualcomm Inc. The merger is the industry’s second megadeal this year and is unlikely to be the last, analysts said. The $37 billion price represents a premium of about 28 percent over Broadcom’s market value of $28.85 billion as of Tuesday’s close, before the Wall Street Journal reported that the companies were in talks. Demand for cheaper chips and new products to power Internet-connected gadgets is driving consolidation in the industry. The Avago-Broadcom deal follows NXP Semiconductors’  $11.8 billion offer to buy Freescale Semiconductor Ltd  in March. Avago had also bid for Freescale, people familiar with the matter said at the time. Intel has also been in talks to buy chipmaker Altera Corp  in a deal that could top $10 billion. Until Thursday, Avago’s biggest deal was for chipmaker LSI Corp, which it bought for $6.6 billion last year. Tan’s strategy has been to look at potential targets that do not necessarily have the best strategic fit but have cost-cutting potential to build value. Avago and Broadcom first spoke about a potential merger in October 2014 but could not agree on a price, said people familiar with the matter who are unauthorized to speak publicly about it. Talks heated up in April when Avago approached Broadcom again with higher offers, and negotiations continued until the two agreed on a deal. Private equity firm Silver Lake Partners, which is an Avago investor and holds a board seat, worked closely with the company to help evaluate Broadcom and structure the deal, said two sources who are unauthorized to speak publicly about the deal. The merger will help the companies improve their bargaining position with manufacturers. Irvine, California-based Broadcom has been struggling to grow as competition in the mobile chip business intensifies. The company’s revenue increased by just 1.5 percent last year. Broadcom’s shares closed down 1.5 percent at $56.25 on Thursday, while Avago’s fell 0.62 percent to $142.38. The companies said they expected to close the deal by the end of the first quarter of 2016 and save $750 million within 18 months. The deal has a breakup fee of $1 billion, one of the unidentified sources said. The new Broadcom would have annual revenue of $15 billion and an enterprise value of $77 billion, the companies said in a statement. Broadcom shareholders will own about 32 percent of the combined company. They would also have the option to choose between various combinations of cash and stock. Avago, which is incorporated in Singapore and also has headquarters in San Jose, California, said it intended to fund the cash portion of the deal by using funds from the combined company and new debt of $9 billion. Avago was advised by Deutsche Bank, Bank of America, Barclays, Citigroup and Credit Suisse. Broadcom was advised by JPMorgan Chase, while Evercore served as financial adviser to the Special Committee of the board. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP is the legal adviser to Broadcom. Broadcom co-founder Henry Nicholas was advised by Centerview and Morrison & Foerster.

The latest data showed the economy contracted at a 0.7 percent annual rate in the first quarter, a sharp turnaround from an earlier estimate of a 0.2 percent growth pace issued last month. Economists had expected GDP would be revised to show a contraction of 0.8 percent. Consumer sentiment fell in May, a survey by the University of Michigan showed, while the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Business Barometer unexpectedly fell in May. “The data is telling us that the economy is improving but it is not super strong,” said Kim Forrest, a senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. “We are looking at the first half of 2015, which is probably not as strong as investors would have liked. So that adds to today’s lackluster market action.” Investors keep a keen eye on economic data for cues to help narrow down the timing of an increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve. “Today’s market action says the rate increase is going to happen in September,” Forrest added. The GDP report also showed that corporate profits declined 8.7 percent, the largest drop in a year and the second straight quarterly fall. Greece’s ability to strike a deal with its euro zone partners by Sunday also weighed on global markets. A euro zone official said Greece will not be able to get the money still available under its current bailout plan if it does not agree to the outline of a reforms-for-cash deal with creditors by the end of next week. At 11:47 a.m. ET (1547 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  was down 105.81 points, or 0.58 percent, at 18,020.31, the S&P; 500 was down 10.03 points, or 0.47 percent, at 2,110.76 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 22.08 points, or 0.43 percent, at 5,075.89.

The U.S. government slashed its gross domestic product estimate to show GDP shrinking at a 0.7 percent annual rate instead of the 0.2 percent growth pace it estimated last month. Economists had expected GDP would be revised to show a contraction of 0.8 percent. “Monetary policy from the Fed is forward looking and GDP by definition is a rear view mirror and the important thing now is that it wasn’t a big miss,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York.

928,INTC,Intel to buy Altera for $16.7 billion in its biggest deal ever,"(Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) agreed to buy Altera Corp (ALTR.O) for $16.7 billion as the world’s biggest chipmaker seeks to make up for slowing demand from the PC industry by expanding its line-up of higher-margin chips used in data centers. By combining with Altera, Intel will be able to bundle its processing chips with the smaller company’s programmable chips, which are used, among other things, to speed up Web-searches. Intel said on Monday it would offer $54 per share for San Jose, California-based Altera, a 10.5 percent premium to Altera’s close on Friday. Altera’s shares were changing hands at $51.78, well below the offer price, in afternoon trading. That suggested that some investors felt the deal could face regulatory hurdles, but analysts said there was virtually no overlap of products between the companies. Intel’s shares were down about 1.7 percent at $33.86. The deal valued Altera at about 9 times forward revenue, according to Thomson Reuters data. “It seems very high to me,” Stifel, Nicolaus & Co analyst Kevin Cassidy told Reuters. “The last one I remember that was close was Broadcom buying NetLogic at 8 times forward revenues, and that didn’t turn out very well for Broadcom.” The deal price is unchanged from Intel’s unsolicited offer that sources had said Altera rejected in April. The integration of Altera’s chips with Intel’s will create a new class of products giving customers a significant improvement in performance, lower costs and a lot more flexibility, Intel Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told Reuters. “That’s the piece that’s pretty exciting about it,” he said. Intel looked at other targets, but Altera was the best bet to create value for the shareholders, Smith said. The transaction is the third big one in the highly fragmented chip industry this year. In the industry’s biggest-ever deal, Avago Technologies Ltd (AVGO.O) agreed last week to buy Broadcom Corp BRCM.O for $37 billion. Altera’s programmable chips will allow Intel to increase the computational capability of its Xeon server chips, which could be under attack post the Avago-Broadcom merger, Summit Research analyst Srinivasan Sundararajan told Reuters. NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O) set off the latest round of  deals in March when it agreed to buy Freescale Semiconductor Ltd FSL.N for $12 billion. The deal is Intel’s biggest ever, outstripping its $7.7 billion acquisition of security software maker McAfee in 2011. It also underscores Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich’s determination to expand beyond chips for PCs, the company’s mainstay. Intel slashed nearly $1 billion from its first-quarter revenue forecast in March, saying that small businesses were delaying upgrading their computers. Personal computer shipments fell 5.2 percent in the first three months of this year, extending three years of decline, according to research firm Gartner. Net revenue from Intel’s PC group increased just 4 percent in 2014, generating about 62 percent of total revenue, while revenue in its data center group increased 18 percent, providing just over a quarter of overall revenue. The deal will also help Intel become more involved in the so-called Internet of Things - the concept of connecting ordinary household devices to the Internet. The New York Post reported on Thursday that Intel and Altera had restarted talks. Up to Friday’s close, Altera’s shares had risen 41.3 percent since the Wall Street Journal reported on March 27 that the two companies were in talks. Intel’s shares rose 14.6 percent. J.P.

929,INTC,"US STOCKS-Wall St edges up after recent losses, mixed data","* Construction spending up, manufacturing growth picks up * April consumer spending flat * Intel falls on $16.7 bln Altera buy * Indexes up: Dow 0.2 pct, S&P; 0.2 pct, Nasdaq 0.3 pct   (Updates to close) By Caroline Valetkevitch June 1 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended with modest gains on Monday, recovering part of last week’s losses in a session marked by cautious trading as investors reacted to mixed economic data. A report from ISM showed the pace of manufacturing growth rose in May. Other data showed construction spending surged in April but consumer spending was unexpectedly flat. Investors are weighing data to try to guess how soon the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said with little evidence of a rebound, the Fed is in no position to start raising interest rates for the first time since 2006. “The things that seem to be driving the market today are a bounce-back from the selling and some pretty good economic data. But as the day has progessed, some of the enthusiasm has worn off since the debate continues as to when the Fed is going to raise rates,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T; Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. “The risk is that the Fed raises interest rates into a slowing economy.” Eight of the 10 major S&P; indexes were higher, with health, industrials and technology among sectors with the most gains. Transportation stocks rebounded from recent losses. The Dow Jones transportation average, which last week came within a hair of correction territory, was up 1.1 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 29.69 points, or 0.16 percent, to 18,040.37, the S&P; 500 gained 4.34 points, or 0.21 percent, to 2,111.73 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 12.90 points, or 0.25 percent, to 5,082.93. Immunogen surged more than 70 percent, leading a rally in cancer drug makers’ stocks after they presented positive data at a conference. Bristol-Myers shares jumped 2.9 percent to $66.48, giving the S&P; 500 its biggest boost, after the FDA accepted its application for a combination melanoma treatment. Intel fell 1.6 percent to $33.90 and was the biggest drag on the three major indexes after the company agreed to buy programmable-chip maker Altera for $16.7 billion. Altera rose 5.8 percent to $51.68. Amid mounting worries of a Greek default, Athens missed a self-imposed Sunday deadline to reach an agreement to unlock aid. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,630 to 1,417, for a 1.15-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,371 issues fell and 1,363 advanced for a 1.01-to-1 ratio favoring decliners. The S&P; 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and 6 new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 100 new highs and 51 new lows. About 5.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.1 billion daily average for the last five sessions, according to BATS Global Markets.

930,INTC,Fitch Affirms Intel at 'A+/F1' on Altera Acquisition; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 01 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings for Intel  Corporation (Intel), including the long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'A+'  and short-term IDR of 'F1', following Intel's announcement it will acquire  Altera Corporation (Altera) for $16.7 billion in cash. Fitch's actions affect $13.2 billion of debt, excluding incremental debt  issuance to fund the vast majority of the Altera acquisition. The Rating Outlook  is Stable. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release. The ratings and Outlook reflect Fitch's belief that Intel's operating profile  will remain strong and credit protection measures solid for the rating, despite  expectations for significant incremental debt issuance to fund the acquisition.  Longer-term, Altera may strengthen Intel's offerings in data center and internet  of things (IoT) Altera is a leading provider of field programmable logic devices (PLD) with 39%  share in the $5 billion PLD market. By combining Intel's processors and Altera's  PLDs on a lower-cost and better-performing single die, Intel hopes to accelerate  growth in the data center and take share from application-specific solutions  providers in rapidly growing IoT markets.  Altera adds nearly $2 billion of revenues with gross profit margins in the  mid-60s, slightly higher than that of Intel with meaningfully lower capital  intensity as a fabless semiconductor marker. In addition, Intel and Altera's  existing foundry relationship and design collaboration with Altera may reduce  integration risk.  Intel plans to fund the acquisition with cash and incremental debt, although  Fitch estimates new debt will comprise the vast majority of the purchase price,  since all but $3.4 billion of Intel's $14.1 billion of total cash at March 31,  2015 was located offshore. As a result, Fitch expects total leverage (total  debt-to-operating EBITDA) of approximately 1x versus 0.5x for the latest 12  months (LTM) ended March 31, 2015.  With Fitch's expectations for more than $5 billion of annual free cash flow  (FCF), domestic FCF over the next two to three quarters prior to the  acquisition's close could reduce the amount of new debt to fund the purchase  price. Fitch also expects the company will moderate share repurchases to  maintain conservative total leverage. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings are supported by:  --Intel's microprocessor dominance and significant technology leadership,  particularly in manufacturing. Intel's x86 processor architecture is also the  premiere platform for data center/servers, providing the company a significant  advantage in the enterprise and cloud-computing space.  --Broad geographic and business diversification. Although the majority of the  company's revenue is derived from PC and server demand, these markets are driven  by different secular growth trends which Fitch expects to contribute to  longer-term stability.  --Continued long-term secular growth in digitalization and computer adoption  worldwide as well as greater penetration of microprocessors in areas outside of  traditional computing.  Rating concerns include:  --Intel's exposure to the cyclical demand for semiconductors which is typically  exacerbated at the beginning of cyclical downturns due to channel inventory  contraction.  --Significant and fixed investment intensity, including research and development  (R&D;) and capital spending. Intel's leading profit margins largely compensate  for this risk although capital spending has at times approached 50% of operating  EBITDA.  --Intel has significant customer concentration with its largest customers  typically accounting for 40% of total revenues. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Flattish organic revenue growth in fiscal 2015, driven by weaker than expected  personal computer (PC) demand that will be offset by continued strength in data  center server chips.  --Beyond the near term, organic revenue growth in the low- to mid-single digits,  driven by solid data center-related demand and, to a lesser extent, Intel's  strategy to combine both processers and PLDs on a single die. --Consistent profitability through the forecast period, due to a more stable  pricing environment and Intel's manufacturing cost leadership.  --Annual capital spending of $9 billion to $10 billion and more than $11 billion  of annual R&D; investments through the intermediate-term to support the  continuation of Moore's Law. --Management moderates share repurchases to the amount of cash used to fund the  acquisition. RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative rating actions could result from:  --Fitch's expectation total leverage will remain above 1.25x, driven by more  aggressive share repurchases and/or greater acquisition activity to build  Intel's mobility segment;  --Fitch's expectation for normalized FCF-to-adjusted debt approaching 20%, as a  result of continued tablet cannibalization of PC sales, and lack of penetration  into the mobile market.  Positive rating action is unlikely, given the cyclicality and volatility  inherent in the semiconductor business, as well as the need for flexibility in  managing technological changes and challenges. A positive rating action would  likely require:  --Profitability improvement across the Mobile and Communications Group in line  with competitors, signifying improved competitiveness and increased market share  within the space.  --An explicit commitment to a leverage ratio of 1x or below. LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE Liquidity as of March 28, 2015 was solid and consisted of: -- $14.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of  which $3.4 billion was located in the U.S.;  --$3 billion commercial paper program (CP) with no outstanding balance.  Fitch's expectation for more than $5 billion of annual FCF also supports  liquidity. The company does not have a revolving credit facility to support its  CP program but Fitch views Intel's strong liquidity as providing ample support  for the program.  Total debt as of March 28, 2015 was $13.3 billion and primarily consisted of:  -- $1.5 billion in 1.95% senior unsecured notes due October 2016;  -- $3 billion in 1.35% senior unsecured notes due December 2017; -- $2 billion in 3.3% senior unsecured notes due October 2021;  -- $1.5 billion in 2.7% senior unsecured notes due December 2022;  -- $750 million in 4.0% senior unsecured notes due December 2032;  -- $1.6 billion principal value in 2.95% junior subordinated debentures due July  2035;  -- $2 billion principal value in 3.25% junior subordinated debentures due July  2039;  -- $1.5 billion in 4.8% senior unsecured notes due October 2041; -- $924 million in 4.25% senior unsecured notes due December 2042.  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings for Intel:  --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+';  --Short-term IDR at 'F1';  --$3 billion CP program at 'F1';  --Senior unsecured notes at 'A+';  --Junior subordinated notes at 'A'.

934,INTC,UPDATE 4-Intel to buy Altera for $16.7 bln in its biggest deal ever,"* Offer of $54 per share is 10.5 pct premium to Friday close * Altera shares trading well below offer * Deal is third big one in chip industry this year   (Adds link to Breakingviews column; updates shares) By Lehar Maan and Liana B. Baker June 1 (Reuters) - Intel Corp agreed to buy Altera Corp for $16.7 billion as the world’s biggest chipmaker seeks to make up for slowing demand from the PC industry by expanding its line-up of higher-margin chips used in data centers. By combining with Altera, Intel will be able to bundle its processing chips with the smaller company’s programmable chips, which are used, among other things, to speed up Web-searches. Intel said on Monday it would offer $54 per share for San Jose, California-based Altera, a 10.5 percent premium to Altera’s close on Friday. Altera’s shares were changing hands at $51.78, well below the offer price, in afternoon trading. That suggested that some investors felt the deal could face regulatory hurdles, but analysts said there was virtually no overlap of products between the companies. Intel’s shares were down about 1.7 percent at $33.86. The deal valued Altera at about 9 times forward revenue, according to Thomson Reuters data. “It seems very high to me,” Stifel, Nicolaus & Co analyst Kevin Cassidy told Reuters. “The last one I remember that was close was Broadcom buying NetLogic at 8 times forward revenues, and that didn’t turn out very well for Broadcom.” The deal price is unchanged from Intel’s unsolicited offer that sources had said Altera rejected in April. The integration of Altera’s chips with Intel’s will create a new class of products giving customers a significant improvement in performance, lower costs and a lot more flexibility, Intel Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told Reuters. “That’s the piece that’s pretty exciting about it,” he said. Intel looked at other targets, but Altera was the best bet to create value for the shareholders, Smith said. The transaction is the third big one in the highly fragmented chip industry this year. In the industry’s biggest-ever deal, Avago Technologies Ltd agreed last week to buy Broadcom Corp for $37 billion. Altera’s programmable chips will allow Intel to increase the computational capability of its Xeon server chips, which could be under attack post the Avago-Broadcom merger, Summit Research analyst Srinivasan Sundararajan told Reuters. NXP Semiconductors NV set off the latest round of  deals in March when it agreed to buy Freescale Semiconductor Ltd  for $12 billion. The deal is Intel’s biggest ever, outstripping its $7.7 billion acquisition of security software maker McAfee in 2011. It also underscores Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich’s determination to expand beyond chips for PCs, the company’s mainstay. Intel slashed nearly $1 billion from its first-quarter revenue forecast in March, saying that small businesses were delaying upgrading their computers. Personal computer shipments fell 5.2 percent in the first three months of this year, extending three years of decline, according to research firm Gartner. Net revenue from Intel’s PC group increased just 4 percent in 2014, generating about 62 percent of total revenue, while revenue in its data center group increased 18 percent, providing just over a quarter of overall revenue. The deal will also help Intel become more involved in the so-called Internet of Things - the concept of connecting ordinary household devices to the Internet. The New York Post reported on Thursday that Intel and Altera had restarted talks. Up to Friday’s close, Altera’s shares had risen 41.3 percent since the Wall Street Journal reported on March 27 that the two companies were in talks. Intel’s shares rose 14.6 percent. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Rothschild Inc are financial advisers to Intel. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP are legal advisers. Goldman Sachs & Co is Altera’s financial adviser, and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati Professional Corp is legal adviser.

Data from ISM showed that the pace of manufacturing growth rose in May. Other data showed construction spending surged in April, but consumer spending was unexpectedly flat. The data left investor’s with a mixed view about the strength of the economy’s recovery from the first-quarter’s slump as they try to gauge when the Federal Reserve will ultimately raise interest rates. With little evidence of a rebound, the Fed is in no position to start raising interest rates for the first time since 2006, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said. “We’re seeing a lot of counter trends in the market,” said Rick Fier, director of trading at Conifer Securities in New York. “One thing this market hasn’t been seeing is inflows which gets put to work.” Fier said the mixed data, rumors about Greece reaching a deal and volatility in currencies and bond yields added to the choppiness. Amid mounting worries of a Greek default, Athens missed a self-imposed Sunday deadline to reach an agreement to unlock aid, the same day Economy Minister George Stathakis said he expected a deal in “a few days”. At 13:11 p.m. ET (1711 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  was up 71.26 points, or 0.4 percent, at 18,081.94, the S&P; 500 was up 8.12 points, or 0.39 percent, at 2,115.51 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 23.48 points, or 0.46 percent, at 5,093.50. Eight of the 10 major S&P; indexes were higher. The health index was the biggest gainer with a 0.68 percent rise, led by Bristol-Myers’ 3.6 percent rise to $66.91 after the FDA accepted its application for a combination melanoma treatment. Intel fell 1.3 percent to $34.01 and was the biggest drag on the three major indexes after the company agreed to buy programmable-chip maker Altera for $16.7 billion. Altera rose 6 percent to $51.79. Microsoft was the Dow's biggest gainer with a 1.6 percent increase to $47.65, doubling its gains after the Wall Street Journal reported the company bought a German startup. on.wsj.com/1AG0XDt Disney rose 0.9 percent to $111.41 after Barron’s said the stock could climb 50 percent over the next three years. Disney also said its CFO had resigned. Immunogen surged 64.3 percent to $14.74, leading a rally in cancer drug makers’ stocks after they presented positive data at a conference.

The dollar and the yields on U.S. debt rose after the data. “We’re seeing a lot of counter trends in the market,” said Rick Fier, director of trading at Conifer Securities in New York. “One thing this market hasn’t been seeing is inflows which gets put to work.” Fier said the mixed data, rumors about Greece reaching a deal and volatility in currencies and bond yields added to the choppiness. Greece missed a self-imposed Sunday deadline for reaching an agreement to unlock aid, the same day Economy Minister George Stathakis said he expected a deal in “a few days”.

News that Greece’s creditors are close to finishing a draft agreement to put to the leftist government in Athens pushed the dollar to its biggest one-day loss against the euro since mid-March. New orders for U.S. factory goods unexpectedly fell in April as demand for transportation equipment and other goods weakened - the latest data that suggest the economy might not be bouncing back strongly enough after a first-quarter slump, to permit a rate hike earlier rather than later in the year. The economy’s recent poor performance may be more than transitory, as the full impact of weak consumer spending, low investment and the high value of the dollar become apparent, Fed board member Lael Brainard said. “Interest rates are not going to matter if they’re rising because of the strong economy and earnings growth, and we’re not seeing evidence of either,” said Warren West, head trader at Greentree Brokerage Services in Philadelphia. “So, we’re stuck in the lateral type of pattern until we get some clarity on the broader economy.” At 13:04 p.m. ET (1704 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  was up 42.14 points, or 0.23 percent, at 18,082.51, the S&P; 500 was up 5.01 points, or 0.24 percent, at 2,116.74 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 15.03 points, or 0.3 percent, at 5,097.96.

The utilities index fell 1.57 percent as U.S. 10-Year Treasury yield popped up 2.25 pct. Intel dropped 1.7 percent to $33.34 and was the biggest drag on the three major indexes after BMO downgraded the stock saying it didn’t like the costly Altera deal. Airline stocks were down 0.97 percent after reports of a multiple bomb threats against U.S. aircraft and Delta’s weak forecast. Delta was down 2.5 percent at $43.26.

939,INTC,RPT-Intel's purchase of Altera defends its datacenter dominance,"(Repeats to widen distribution) By Lehar Maan and Bill Rigby BANGALORE/SEATTLE, June 1 (Reuters) - Intel Corp’s  $17 billion purchase of programmable chip maker Altera Corp  is a costly defensive move to ward off rivals in the prized datacenter business it dominates, analysts said on Monday. Intel’s biggest acquisition ever will let the Santa Clara, California company offer twice the computing power when its Xeon processors used in servers are combined with Altera’s programmable chips. With a stagnant PC industry and little progress in smartphones, selling high-end server chips is an increasingly important source of profits. “This whole deal is defensive for the datacenter,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, who saw it as an admission by Intel that it was getting harder to drive performance gains. He questioned Intel’s projections for the programmable chip market, which is built on datacenter use and growing adoption of Intel chips in everyday objects connected to the Internet. “I think their growth goals are ludicrous,” he said. “They think it’s going to grow 7 percent a year, but Altera shrunk 2 percent a year in the last three years.” Still, big data companies such as Google, Facebook and Microsoft are all tweaking their servers to get their datacenters to run faster and more efficiently. Microsoft has tried using programmable chips combined with Intel’s Xeon processors. Altera’s chips, called field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA), can be configured as needed to make servers faster at handling proprietary tasks, like providing web-search results or updating social networks. “You can put your software down into the silicon,” Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich told CNBC in an interview. Intel, which analysts estimate has more than 90 percent of the datacenter market, already has an agreement to use Altera chips. Its move comes as companies such as Qualcomm  Inc, using ARM Holdings -designed chips and the soon-to-be merged Avago Technologies and Broadcom Corp , also target the datacenter market. By buying Altera, Intel avoids the risk of being dropped as the smaller company’s manufacturing partner, which had been the subject of some speculation, said Gartner analyst Mark Hung. The purchase means Intel is hedging against the likelihood that the rise of FPGA chips will reduce the need for central processing unit (CPU) chips running servers, where Intel currently dominates. “This way Intel will profit if customers use FPGAs instead of CPUs,” said FBR Capital markets analyst Christopher Rolland. “Intel will be the only company that will be able to combine x86 server CPUs with FPGAs onto a single die. This could eventually be a $1 billion market, with the lion’s share going to Intel.”   (Reporting by Lehar Maan in Bangalore, Bill Rigby in Seattle, Diane Bartz in Washington; Editing by Diane Craft)",6022015,http://www.reuters.com/article/altera-ma-intel-datacenters/rpt-intels-purchase-of-altera-defends-its-datacenter-dominance-idUSL1N0YO03E20150602

941,INTC,Lattice Semiconductor open to sale for 'high premium': CEO,"(Reuters) - Lattice Semiconductor Corp - one of just a handful of programmable-chip makers left after Intel Corp’s deal to buy Altera Corp - is open to a sale, but only for a bigger premium than that offered by Intel, CEO Darin Billerbeck said. Billerbeck singled out Qualcomm Inc and Taiwan’s MediaTek Inc as good fits, but would not comment on whether Lattice was holding talks with either company. “They see the flexibility we bring in ... but then there are also some of the communication guys, which see us pretty strong in programmability,” Billerbeck said in an interview. Qualcomm and MediaTek could not immediately be reached. Lattice, which has a market value of about $740 million,  makes programmable logic chips and related software used in everything from smartphones to cars. After the Intel-Altera deal, Lattice and Xilinx Inc are the only reasonably large standalone companies left in the programmable chip industry. Lattice caters to the low-end of the market, while Xilinx focuses on higher-end products. Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, agreed to buy Altera last week for $16.7 billion, or $54 per share. That represented a premium of just 10.5 percent to Altera’s previous-day close, but was 56 percent more than the stock’s price before the Wall Street Journal reported in March that the two companies were in merger talks. “If someone walks in the door and gives us a solid offer at a high premium we are going to consider it,” Billerbeck said. FBR Capital analyst Christopher Rolland said Lattice was a “high probability acquisition target”. “They are sub-scale and would earn far more under a larger company umbrella,” Rolland said. Billerbeck said he did not think Lattice was an immediate takeover target, given the chip industry’s current focus on large acquisitions. “However, that can change rapidly,” he said. Lattice, whose shares have fallen about 8 percent this year, reported revenue of about $366 million in 2014, an increase of about 10 percent. The stock was trading at $6.38 at midday on Thursday, up about 0.5 percent from Wednesday’s close.

942,INTC,Lattice and Xilinx seen gaining on Altera after Intel deal,"(Reuters) - Intel Corp’s (INTC.O) $16.7 billion acquisition of programmable-chip maker Altera Corp (ALTR.O) is not the bad news for Altera’s rivals that it may seem to be at first blush. In fact, the two main companies left in the programmable chip business - Xilinx Inc (XLNX.O) and Lattice Semiconductor Corp (LSCC.O) - are likely to benefit, analysts say. With Altera becoming part of Intel, the San Jose-based company is likely to focus on the x86 microprocessors made by the world’s biggest chip company, rather than those made by companies such as ARM Holdings Plc ARM.L. Altera now provides chips for both x86 and ARM-based processors. “(The combined Intel-Altera) will likely become x86 centric and neglect the large and growing ARM-based applications,” said Xilinx’s senior vice president of strategy, Steve Glaser. That gives Xilinx and Lattice the opportunity to take a bigger share of the ARM-based market - Xilinx at the high end and Lattice at the low end. Lattice Chief Executive Darin Billerbeck told Reuters this week he expected the Intel-Altera deal to increase his company’s total addressable market by $300-$400 million. “I think within communications and the industrial, we’ll see some of the benefit right away,” he said. Programmable-chips are used in everything from smartphones to cars and can be combined with computing processors to speed up servers in data centers. Intel processors are geared to function with high-performance desktops and servers, and consume a lot of power. ARM-based processors are more power-efficient as they take less time to perform a function, making them suited for smartphones. Intel has said that combining Altera’s chips with its own server processors, such as the x86, will let it offer twice the computing power. However, analysts said customers looking for faster microprocessors may now become concerned about becoming overly dependent on Intel. Many may prefer to do business with a company that only makes programmable-chips, such as Xilinx and Lattice, they said. “I think (Xilinx) is going to continue to gain market share ... I think Lattice should benefit as well,” Robert W. Baird analyst Tristan Gerra said. Intel may well assign programmable chips to “second-class-citizen priority, where fussing over customers is alien,” analysts at brokerage Raymond James wrote in a client note. Lattice’s market-share gains are likely to last longer than Xilinx’s, given its focus on the low end of the market, an area that is not likely to be a priority for Intel, analysts said. Xilinx, though, could face stiffer competition down the road after Intel and Altera fully integrate and start offering new products. Intel has said it will take six-to-nine months to close its deal with Altera. Drexel Hamilton analyst Richard Whittington, who covers Xilinx, said the company had the opportunity to grow in the programmable chip market for the next two years. After that it “invites the question of who will win and succeed,” he said. Xilinx’s shares have risen about 18 percent and Lattice’s about 2.5 percent since March 27 when the Wall Street Journal reported that Intel and Altera were in talks. An Intel spokesman declined to comment for this story. Altera did not respond to a request for comment.

944,INTC,"Intel pledges $125 million for start-ups that back women, minorities","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Following up on its earlier pledge to spend $300 million over the next five years to improve diversity, Intel Corp promised more on Tuesday, this time to back companies with women and minorities in leadership roles. Intel Capital, the chipmaker’s venture capital arm, said it would allocate $125 million over the next few years to bring more management diversity to its start-up portfolio. Some of that sum will overlap with the previously announced $300 million, Intel said. The move comes as technology companies face heavy criticism for their overwhelmingly male and white workforces, which some argue creates a climate that discourages women and minorities from aspiring to work in technology or sticking around if they start there. Increased diversity would lead to stronger, more innovative companies, the thinking goes. The fund, spearheaded by Lisa Lambert, an African-American and a managing director at Intel Capital, is leading by example. She and her team have already spent $16.7 million on an initial four investments, including one company led by a woman. Brit Morin’s Brit & Co, an online San Francisco-based retailer sells do-it-yourself kits and tutorials. Like all the companies backed by the fund, Brit & Co fits into Intel’s broader strategy, in this case, advancing technologies such as Intel’s Galileo development board. Brit & Co is promoting the board, essentially a circuit board with an Intel chip, as a tool its “maker” community can use on projects. “We’re not doing this purely because they represent diverse teams,” Lambert said about the companies in an interview. “They’re integral to Intel’s core investments.” By funneling some diversity money through venture capital, Intel reasons it can nurture a group of role models that in turn will encourage more minorities and women to aspire to work in technology startups. That will benefit both Intel and the broader economy. The fund also led an investment in CareCloud, a Miami-based healthcare provider where the diversity quotient is less obvious given the sea of white male faces that appear on the management section of the company’s website.  But women and Hispanics comprise more than half CareCloud’s workforce, Lambert said, including founder and chief strategy officer Albert Santalo. Rounding out the group are Mark One, a San Francisco-based company peddling cups that use Intel technology to automatically evaluate the calories and nutritional content of beverages poured into them, and Venafi, a Salt Lake City-based cybersecurity company. Three African-Americans sit on the executive staff of Mark One, Lambert said, while three senior women, including the chief information officer, serve at Venafi.

946,INTC,Difficult markets put Intel jumbo financing on hold,"LONDON, June 12 (IFR) - US technology company Intel Corporation was planning to issue a multi-currency bond for up to USD10bn this week, before torrid European market conditions soured the prospects for a sale. “It looks as if the deal is postponed for now,” an investor who attended the roadshow said. “The company doesn’t need to rush it to the market and is not willing to pay up given the market volatility. It will likely be back later this summer after it announces earnings and the market settles.” The company was targeting eight- and 15-year euro tranches, a 20-year sterling piece and various US dollar maturities, according to the investor. He expected the euro and sterling portions to total USD4bn with the remainder in US dollars. Intel hired Barclays and JP Morgan to hold a European roadshow from Wednesday June 3 to Friday June 5 ahead of a potential benchmark euro- and/or sterling-denominated deal. The European corporate market has crumbled under the pressure of continued rates volatility over recent weeks, forcing potential issuers either to swallow the chunky premiums required or delay and run the risk of hitting the summer lull. A mere EUR500m was raised this week, making it the slowest week for European corporate bond issuance since July last year. A source close to the deal said Intel is now waiting until after its earnings announcement on July 15 to sell the deal. Intel revealed at the beginning of the month that it would purchase programmable chip-maker Altera Corp for USD17bn. “They wanted to do about half of their planned total debt funding for the Altera acquisition, and the additional USD7.5bn to USD8.5bn funding needed will come from cash on Intel’s balance sheet,” the investor said. Intel is rated A1/A+/A+ (all stable).

947,INTC,"Exclusive: Advanced Micro Devices mulling breakup, spinoff - sources","(Reuters) - Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices is at the initial stage of reviewing whether to split itself in two or spin off a business, seeking to reverse its fortunes and take on rival Intel Corp, according to three people familiar with the matter. The deliberations are preliminary and no decision has been made, the people said. The review highlights Chief Executive Lisa Su’s determination to consider every possible option to turn the company around. AMD has asked a consulting firm to help it review its options and draw up scenarios on how a break-up or spin-off would work, the people said this week, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. One option under consideration is separating AMD’s graphics and licensing business from its server business, which sells processors that power data centers, one of the people said.  AMD had explored such a move in the past and decided against it, the people said. Su, however, who took over as CEO last October, judged that there is merit for the company to at least consider such a possibility again, the people added. There is no certainty that a split or spin-off will occur, the people cautioned. A spokeswoman for AMD declined to comment.  AMD, which has a market capitalization of around $2 billion, has competed with much larger Intel since the 1980s, and at times has made inroads with its PC and server chips. AMD has an extensive cross-licensing agreement with Intel, an issue AMD would have to study carefully in the case of a break-up. In the last few years, AMD has been caught somewhat flat-footed by new competitors designing low-cost and power-efficient chips. AMD shares have fallen 40 percent over the last 12 months. The Sunnyvale, California-based company, which said in October it would cut 7 percent of its workforce, is now shifting its focus to gaming consoles and low-power servers to combat falling laptop sales. While large rivals such as Intel have deeper pockets to fund research on new products, AMD faces declining cash flows and has a more modest balance sheet. AMD’s net loss widened to $180 million, or 23 cents per share, in the quarter that ended March 28, from $20 million, or 3 cents per share, a year earlier. It also missed on revenue expectations. It is forecasting a return to profitability in the second half of the year.

Investors are also keeping a close watch on the progress of Greece’s negotiations with its creditors. Greece rejected a five-month extension of bailout on Friday. Euro zone finance ministers will meet on Saturday to decide Greece’s fate. “For most part we are trading off any news that comes out of Greece. I am looking for an agreement that falls somewhere in between full compliance and default,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. University of Michigan’s final reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment for June was 96.1, higher than its preliminary reading of 94.6. “Investors are really craving healthy economic data. Any kind of incoming data that is stronger than expected is welcomed by the investor community,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York. The annual shuffling of Russell stock indexes may produce a rush of transactions worth over $40 billion in the final moments of trading on Friday. At 13:24 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones industrial average  was up 10.81 points, or 0.06 percent, at 17,901.17, the S&P; 500  was down 6.92 points, or 0.33 percent, at 2,095.39 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 51.33 points, or 1 percent, at 5,060.86. Five of the 10 major S&P; 500 sectors were lower, with information technology leading the decliners with a 1.1 percent fall. Nike shares rose 4.6 percent to $110.02, and was the biggest boost to the Dow, after the world’s largest footwear maker reported a better-than-expected profit as it sold more high-margin shoes and apparel at higher prices. Finish Line shares rose 4.6 percent to $28.22 after the athletic shoes and apparel retailer reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue. Micron Technology shares were down 19 percent at $19.56 after the chipmaker said it expects a further decline in prices of chips used in personal computers, and forecast revenue for the current quarter well below market estimates. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,901 to 1,116, for a 1.70-to-1 ratio on the downside. On the Nasdaq, 1,827 issues fell and 870 advanced for a 2.10-to-1 ratio favoring decliners. The S&P; 500 index showed 15 new 52-week highs and 20 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 108 new highs and 42 new lows.

951,INTC,"Wall St Week Ahead-Low earnings forecasts may mean profit beats, market boost","NEW YORK, July 2 (Reuters) - With analysts’ expectations for second-quarter U.S. earnings at rock-bottom levels, many companies may well beat forecasts, possibly setting up the stock market for gains in the coming weeks. Analysts’ estimates for second-quarter U.S. earnings have been dialed down sharply since the start of the year, amid concerns a strong dollar will crimp the profits of U.S. multinationals and expectations energy company earnings will drop for a third straight quarter because of low oil prices. With Alcoa set to kick off results season next week, investors are eyeing a 3-percent projected drop in benchmark S&P; 500 earnings from a year ago, which would be the first profit decline since the third quarter of 2009, according to Thomson Reuters data. However, a similarly dismal forecast from analysts for first-quarter earnings proved overly pessimistic, and S&P; 500 companies ended up with a profit gain of 2.2 percent. That’s persuaded some strategists to expect similar good news in some sectors in the second quarter, which may well provide a boost to Wall Street. “If profits surprise to the upside, which is what I think they’re going to do, that is basically going to convince people we don’t have a negative growth problem, that things are better than feared, and that should be positive for stocks,” said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. market strategist for RBC Capital Markets in New York. Golub added he expects “massive beats” again in the energy sector in the second quarter, mirroring a pattern seen in the first. Excluding the energy sector, S&P; 500 earnings are expected to be up 4.9 percent from a year ago. The second-quarter profit picture has also been overshadowed by concerns about the debt crisis in Greece, which has driven recent losses in stocks. The S&P; 500 is down about 1.5 percent since the June 19 close, and all three major indexes registered losses for last month. Those developments will likely keep investors on edge about results from U.S. companies with considerable exposure to Europe, such as McDonald’s. U.S. companies themselves have offered dismal outlooks for earnings, with negative forecasts for the second quarter outpacing positive ones by a ratio of 4-to-1, compared with 5.7- to-1 in the first quarter, according Thomson Reuters. Those grim expectations have been blamed on the impact of a strong greenback, even though a U.S. dollar index  declined 2.9 percent in the second quarter, following a 9 percent jump in the first. A stronger dollar makes it harder for U.S. companies to compete overseas. “I think FX (foreign exchange) has been more of a headwind than we anticipated,” AutoDesk Chief Executive Carl Bass said in a May 19 conference call with analysts. A weak forecast from Micron Technology last week raised concerns about the outlook for the chip sector, which has  been underperforming the broader market. A semiconductor index  lost 8.7 percent in June, more than four times the S&P; 500’s 2.1 percent fall. “We’re cautiously optimistic. These guys aren’t going to come into a number and know they’re going to miss by a huge margin,” said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Atlanta-based Synovus Trust Company, whose top tech holdings include Intel. Tech companies have issued more negative outlooks than any other S&P; sector, or 24 out of 97 so far from S&P; 500 companies. At the same time, financials are projected to enjoy a 14.8 percent jump in year-over-year earnings, the biggest of any sector, thanks largely to Citigroup, whose results a year ago were hurt by steep litigation charges. Energy companies in the S&P; 500 are forecast to have the biggest drop in profits by far from a year ago, by 63 percent, similar to declines projected for the first quarter, Thomson Reuters data showed. Even then, Golub and other strategists said the ultra-low forecasts just mean companies have an easier bar to beat. “There’s some stability in the second quarter with the dollar and oil, so maybe there’s going to be a positive surprise for multinationals and the energy sector,” said Mark Kepner, managing director, sales and trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.

952,INTC,Short sellers curb Intel bets ahead of second quarter results; tone cautious,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Wall Street expects bad news when Intel Corp (INTC.O) reports its second-quarter results on Wednesday although a few short sellers appear to believe the worst is over for the chipmaker’s recently sinking stock. Signs of weak demand for personal computers have taken a toll on the shares of Intel ahead of its quarterly report due after the market’s close, with Wall Street expecting a year-over-year dip in quarterly revenue for the first time since 2013. Intel’s stock is down 18 percent year to date and has fallen about 7 percent since June 25, when Micron Technology (MU.O) blamed weakness in PCs for a drop in quarterly revenues. “The narrative is that it doesn’t get much worse than it is right now,” said FBR analyst Chris Rolland, who rates Intel  “outperform.”  “As long as DCG (the data center group) hangs in there, I think the stock will probably go up from here,” he said. Suggesting that some short sellers believe Intel’s stock is unlikely to fall much further, the number of shares borrowed has fallen 21 percent since June 29, according to SunGard’s Astec Analytics.  But the number of Intel shares shorted at the end of June was the highest since mid-March according to exchange data.   “Our number still suggests many short sellers are holding onto their positions,” wrote SunGard analyst Karl Loomes in an email. Shares out on loan are typically used for short sales. Options market traders appear to be slightly cautious ahead of Intel’s report. Open interest in Intel puts has been growing at a faster pace than calls since June. Currently 1.2 puts are open for each call, the highest this reading has been this year according to Trade Alert. Intel’s stock was flat on Tuesday and trades at 13 times expected earnings. Also hurting Intel’s stock recently, rival processor maker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) last week posted a steeper-than-expected dip in fiscal first-quarter due to weakness in PCs. Seagate Technology (STX.O), which makes hard-drives for PCs, on Monday warned of poor results for its June quarter. Intel’s data center group, which includes high-end server chips, has helped offset trouble in the PC industry in recent years, but it might also be at risk. Last Thursday, QLogic Corp’s QLGC.O stock slid 21 percent after the network infrastructure maker warned that its revenue in the June quarter would be less than expected due to general weakness in server and storage markets.

953,INTC,Mooted Chinese offer for Micron undervalues chipmaker: analysts,"(Reuters) - China’s Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd would need to pay as much as $38 billion to buy Micron Technology Inc (MU.O), analysts said - assuming that the U.S. government approved the purchase of last U.S. maker of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips. State-backed Tsinghua Unigroup is considering making a bid of $21 per share for Micron, valuing the Idaho-based company at $23 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. Micron’s shares rose as much as 12 percent to $19.79 in morning trading on the Nasdaq on Tuesday. China has been expressing strong interest in building up its domestic chip industry, and buying Micron would be a major coup. An acquisition of Micron would give China access to both DRAM and NAND memory chips, which are used in personal computers and to store music, pictures and other data on smartphones and mobile devices. The country consumes $10-$11 billion of DRAM chips annually, according to JP Morgan analysts. Any deal, though, would need a green light from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which would examine the national security implications. “DRAM and 3D NAND manufacturing technologies are strategic for China but difficult to access,” Jefferies analysts said in a client note. “Leading-edge high volume memory design and manufacturing (intellectual property) is closely held by a handful of companies, none of which we think would want a new entrant from China to affect supply/demand fundamentals unfavorably.” Tsinghua Unigroup has been at the forefront of China’s efforts to expand its chip industry. The company bought Chinese mobile chipmakers Spreadtrum and RDA Electronics in the last two years. Last year, Intel Corp (INTC.O) bought into Tsinghua with a $1.5 billion investment. “With estimated 21 percent market share in DRAM, 16 percent market share in NAND, and solid technology in both markets, Micron would give Tsinghua a solid presence in both areas of memory,” Morgan Stanley analysts said in a report. However, several analysts said an offer of $21 per share would severely undervalue Micron, and there could be counterbids from companies such as SanDisk Corp SNDK.O and South Korea’s SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS). J.P. Morgan analysts said a $27-$29 per share offer would be more realistic, while Needham analysts said the company was unlikely to sell itself for less than $35 per share, implying a deal value of about $38 billion. Micron’s shares hit a more-than-13-year high of $36.59 in December but have since fallen sharply due to oversupply in the DRAM industry and sluggish demand for PCs.

955,INTC,Political ties could prove double-edged sword for Chinese chipmaker,"BEIJING (Reuters) - When Intel (INTC.O) CEO Brian Krzanich flew into Beijing last October to tie down an investment in Tsinghua Unigroup, a Chinese chip maker, Unigroup CEO Zhao Weiguo whisked him into a meeting at China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), where a vice minister blessed the deal. On Tuesday, following reports that Unigroup was preparing to launch the biggest Chinese takeover bid of a U.S. company, Zhao could not be reached for comment. He was again conferring with MIIT officials. As Zhao prepares an audacious $23 billion bid for Idaho-based chipmaker Micron Technology (MU.O), the close ties to Chinese policymakers that helped propel Unigroup’s swift rise may now be coming back to haunt it. Over the past year, Unigroup has cemented its role as China’s annointed technology champion, buying two semiconductor firms and Hewlett-Packard’s server business - two sectors deemed strategic priorities by China’s economic planners. It has also received more than $6 billion in government-backed loans to carry out research. Along the way, Unigroup has flexed its political muscle on at least two occasions, brushing aside other bidders that had received approval from China’s powerful National Development and Reform Commission to make cross-border acquisitions. China’s leaders, aware that the country’s annual semiconductor imports are worth more than its petroleum imports, have stressed cultivating a domestic chip industry. But analysts say the biggest hurdle to Unigroup successfully acquiring Micron, the only remaining major U.S. maker of DRAM memory, will be political objections on Capitol Hill at a time when the United States and China trade accusations over hacking and other tech-related disputes. The deal would require approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a process often fraught with politics. “[Zhao] operates as a commercial businessman, but what he’s done is align himself with Chinese national strategy,” said Vincent Gu, a veteran semiconductor analyst at iSupply who said there is a “near zero” chance of a deal going through. Unigroup’s influence reflects Tsinghua University’s decades-old status as a nexus of elite politics and leading scientific research. The school is considered more closely affiliated with the Communist Party than Peking University, known more as a liberal hotbed focused on the humanities. Tsinghua, which counts former and current presidents Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping among its graduates, founded Unigroup two decades ago as a way to help bring its science faculty’s research to market. Unigroup’s parent company, Tsinghua Holdings, was at one point steered by Hu’s son, Hu Haifeng, while the father served as China’s paramount leader. Although Zhao, the CEO, told the Wall Street Journal in an April interview that he is not a “white glove” - a front - for government interests, personal relationships between Unigroup and national leaders run deep. Just last week, vice premier Liu Yandong, another Tsinghua alumna and longtime political ally of Hu Jintao, paid an undisclosed visit to the facilities of a Unigroup subsidiary chipmaker in the eastern city of Tianjin, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. A Unigroup spokesman declined to comment for this article. A Micron deal could be particularly sensitive given the recent U.S.-China history involving chips. China issued Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) a record $975 million fine this year for anti-monopolistic behavior.

957,INTC,"Intel serves up revenue, profit beat as data center business grows","(Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) reported better-than-expected quarterly results on Wednesday as growth in its data centers and Internet-of-Things businesses helped offset weak demand for personal computers that use the company’s chips. Shares of the world’s largest chipmaker, which also cut its full-year capital expenditure forecast for the second time, rose as much as 9.2 percent after market before paring some of their gains. The company has been expanding its line-up of higher-margin chips used in data centers to counter slowing demand from the PC industry and agreed to buy Altera Corp (ALTR.O) for $16.7 billion in April as part of these efforts. Revenue from the data center business, Intel’s second-largest, grew 9.7 percent to $3.85 billion in the second quarter from a year earlier, helped by continued adoption of cloud services and demand for data analytics. “We continue to forecast robust growth rates of the data center group, Internet of Things group and NAND businesses, which we expect to mostly offset the PC decline,” Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said on a post-earnings call. Revenue from the PC business, Intel’s largest, fell 13.5 percent to $7.54 billion in the quarter ended June 27. “Our expectations are that the PC market is going to be weaker than previously expected,” Smith said. Research firm Gartner forecast global PC shipments to fall 4.5 percent to 300 million units in 2015, with no respite until at least 2016. Intel forecast current-quarter revenue of $14.3 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $14.08 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company also cut its 2015 capex forecast to $7.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million. It had cut its full-year capex forecast to $8.7 billion from $10 billion in April.

Brent settled down $1.46 at $57.05 while U.S. crude settled down $1.63 at $51.41 a barrel. “We were positive the whole day and we sort of lost our gains right at the tail end,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York. “If crude were to be going down, that would mean there is an assumption this deal may get through Congress or the President’s veto won’t get overturned by Congress such that this Iranian flood of crude comes onto the market.” Financials, up 0.7 percent, helped curb declines. The group was buoyed by a 3.2 percent rise in Bank of America  to $17.68 and a 3.8 percent gain in U.S. Bancorp  to $45.53 after their quarterly results. The S&P; snapped a four-session winning streak, its longest run of gains since January. Celgene climbed 7 percent to $131.39 after touching a record high of $135.98. The company said it would buy Receptos  to get a potential multibillion-dollar drug. Yellen said she expects the economy to grow steadily for the rest of the year, allowing the Fed to hike rates, but gave no direct hint on the timing or pace of a hike. The Fed is broadly expected to hike rates in September or December. The Fed’s Beige Book showed U.S. economic activity continued to expand from mid-May through June, with lower energy prices helping boost consumer spending but remaining a drag on manufacturing. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 3.41 points, or 0.02 percent, to 18,050.17, the S&P; 500 lost 1.55 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,107.4 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 5.95 points, or 0.12 percent, to 5,098.94. Corporate America is expected to report its worst sales decline in nearly six years in the second quarter, while profit is expected to have fallen 2.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters estimates. The effect of uncertainty in Chinese markets and the strong dollar will also be in focus. Yum Brands fell 2.9 percent to $88.88. The owner of Pizza Hut and KFC reported its fourth straight quarter of falling sales, indicating it is still struggling to regain lost ground in China after a food safety scandal last year. The Nasdaq is likely to get a lift on Thursday on the heels of results from Intel and Netflix after the market close. Intel jumped 5.4 percent to $31.30 while Netflix surged 10.4 percent to $108.20 in extended trade, sending Nasdaq e-mini futures up nearly 20 points. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,841 to 1,223, for a 1.51-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,826 issues fell and 998 advanced for a 1.83-to-1 ratio favoring decliners. The benchmark S&P; 500 index posted 30 new 52-week highs and 16 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 140 new highs and 64 new lows. Volume was light, with about 6.09 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.66 billion average so far this month, according to BATS Global Markets.

960,INTC,"Wall St. rises; eBay, Netflix push Nasdaq to record high","(Reuters) - Wall Street ended stronger on Thursday, with the Nasdaq up more than 1 percent at a record high after earnings reports from eBay (EBAY.O) and Netflix (NFLX.O) boosted optimism. Google’s shares jumped more than 13 percent after the bell following a better-than-expected profit report. Sentiment was also bolstered after the Greek parliament voted in favor of austerity measures.     Uninspiring quarterly reports from Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and UnitedHealth (UNH.N), however, capped gains on the Dow.  The S&P; has surged almost 4 percent from eight days ago, when widespread fears about Greece and a Chinese stock selloff pushed the index to its lowest level since March. “It just proves the U.S. market continues to be resilient in the face of what seems like an endless list of global worries,” said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 70.08 points, or 0.39 percent, to 18,120.25. The S&P; 500 .SPX gained 16.89 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,124.29. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 64.24 points, or 1.26 percent, to end at 5,163.18, just beating its previous record-high close of 5,160.095 on June 23. The S&P; was also near a record high. Google’s Class A shares (GOOGL.O) jumped 13.5 percent to $683 after the web search leader posted a better-than-expected profit for the first time in six quarters. That helped extend Thursday’s gains in Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures NQc1 to 1.7 percent from 1.1 percent just before Google reported, suggesting the Nasdaq Composite may open stronger on Friday and potentially extend its record. Nine of the 10 major S&P; 500 sectors were higher, with the utilities index’s .SPLRCU 1.54 percent advance leading the gainers. The materials index .SPLRCM was the lone laggard, down 0.24 percent. The S&P; 500 has recently traded at 16.8 times forward 12-months’ earnings, above the 10-year average of 14.7 times, according to StarMine data. Despite early, upbeat results this week, U.S. companies are expected to post their worst sales decline in nearly six years in the second quarter, while profit is expected to have fallen 2.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters estimates.  “What this season confirms is that we are in a modest growth and modest inflation environment,” said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis. Netflix surged 18.02 percent to a record high of $115.81 a day after reporting strong subscribers numbers.  Citigroup reported its highest quarterly profit in eight years. Its shares rose 3.77 percent to a six-and-a-half year high of $58.59. EBay (EBAY.O) rose 3.39 percent to a record high of $65.59 after reporting better-than-expected quarterly profit and announcing the sale of its enterprise business. But Goldman fell 0.84 percent after posting its smallest quarterly profit in nearly four years, while UnitedHealth fell 0.74 percent after missing analysts’ cost estimates. Advancing issues outnumbered declines on the NYSE by 2,159 to 942; on the Nasdaq, 1,852 issues rose and 945 fell. The S&P; 500 posted 46 new 52-week highs and 13 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 182 new highs and 63 new lows.

961,INTC,Intel's cost cuts could give rivals higher ground: analysts,"(Reuters) - Intel Corp’s move to delay the launch of its next generation chip technology to 2017 may see the company lose ground to rivals Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co  and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. Intel’s shares opened 2.7 percent higher on Thursday it lowered its 2015 capex forecast for a second time, and at least five analysts raised their share price targets by $1-$2. But analysts looked past the short-term benefits for the world’s largest chipmaker. “(The delay) will force investors to question INTC’s (Intel’s) hitherto unassailable manufacturing dominance,” Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer wrote in a note. Intel has now twice delayed the launch of 10 nm technology and its smaller and faster chips. The technology had been set for launch this year. “The other foundries have thus far maintained aggressive plans for future process nodes and INTC will likely face serious questions if these schedules aren’t pushed,” Barclays Capital analysts wrote in a note. Rivals, TSMC and Samsung Electronics plan to launch their 10 nm chip nodes in late 2016 and early 2017, respectively. At least two brokerages raised their ratings on Intel. The median price target is $35. ",7162015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-intel-research/intels-cost-cuts-could-give-rivals-higher-ground-analysts-idUSKCN0PQ1JO20150716

The European Central Bank will meet later in the day and is expected to ease its funding squeeze on shuttered Greek banks. “Now that Greece has been taken care of for the time being, the focus has shifted to what’s happening on the ground in the U.S.,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. “While U.S. equities are fully valued at the moment, if companies are not able to fulfill heightened expectations of stronger earnings in the second half of the year, we will see some more sideways action.” A majority of U.S. companies that have reported so far have posted strong results for the second quarter. Citigroup’s shares rose 2.6 percent to $57.93 premarket, and were set to open at a more than six year high, after the bank reporting its highest quarterly profit in eight years. But Goldman Sachs slipped 0.8 percent to $127.78 after reporting its smallest quarterly profit in nearly four years. Financial companies are expected to get a boost when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates this year. Fed Chair Janet Yellen said on Wednesday that rates will be raised this year, but did not give clues about the timing or pace of a hike. She continues her congressional testimony on Thursday.

965,INTC,$5.7 billion wiped off European tech shares after Apple outlook disappoints,"LONDON (Reuters) - Top European technology stocks shed nearly $6 billion of market value on Wednesday, with suppliers for Apple the top fallers after the tech giant’s revenue forecasts fell short of expectations. While the worst hit were the handful with 20-70 percent direct exposure, the whole sector suffered as investors cautioned against frothy valuations, with the STOXX Europe 600 tech index .SX8P trading well above its historical average. The European technology index lost 5.7 billion dollars of market capitalization, led lower by a 6.5 percent slump in Germany’s Dialog Semiconductors and a 5.1 percent fall in British-listed ARM Holdings ARM.L.  Apple orders accounted for around 70-75 percent of Dialog’s total revenue, industry experts said, while Apple accounted for 20-25 percent of ARM’s processor royalties last year. While Apple’s biggest suppliers, such as Intel (INTC.O) and Qualcomm (QCOM.O), are American, Apple is a large customer of many smaller European companies. Dialog, which makes chips for Apple, lost $287 million, while ARM, which licenses chip designs for use in Apple products, saw $1.7 billion knocked off its value. Dialog remains up 67 percent so far this year, and trades at valuations over 15 percent higher than its historical averages. “We have nothing against Apple, but expectations on that side of the market are a little bit too high and that the reason we now don’t have any Apple-related stocks,” said Anko Beldsnijder, managing director of MainFirst Asset Management. Austria’s Ams AG fell 2.9 percent. Its technology is used in the Apple watch, though in June a Swiss newspaper reported it would miss out on a valuable new Apple contract.  Shares in European companies with smaller direct exposure to Apple such as Infineon (IFXGn.DE) and STMicro (STM.PA) also fell by around 5 percent, with investors saying sentiment around technology stocks in general had turned negative. The STOXX Europe tech index trades at a price of 18.7 times its 12-month forward earnings, against a 10-year average of 16.2 times, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. It trades at a premium to every other sector apart from telecoms and healthcare stocks. Tech consultancy Gartner said in April it forecast a 4 percent rise in semiconductor sales worldwide in 2015 but warned that stronger dollar, excess inventories and end of PC upgrade cycle were seeing “mounting concerns”. ARM’s drop came as the chip-designer’s reported results that were broadly in line with expectations, saying that Apple’s outlook would not change its view of second half trading. Veronika Pechlaner, fund manager at Ashburton, said the resilience of royalties from Apple last quarter was a good sign, and that ARM had enough other diverse streams of revenue to withstand a slight Apple slowdown. “Looking at the share price now, we could be nearing a buying opportunity. We still like ARM in the longer term, even in the context of weaker Apple earnings, as there are lots of opportunities outside handheld devices,” Pechlaner said. She added that Dialog would be more sensitive to Apple sales, and that after today’s fall investors would reconsider their position in the stock in the coming days. “We still own it, it’s a question of whether we still want to continue to own it, whether we add to it here, or if the Apple concentration is a problem in the longer term. It’s definitely a stock to revisit after this.” ",7222015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-markets-europe-tech/5-7-billion-wiped-off-european-tech-shares-after-apple-outlook-disappoints-idUSKCN0PW1P120150722

967,INTC,Qualcomm's potential break-up could lead to courtship with Intel,"(Reuters) - It could be a match made in heaven. Wall Street says Intel Corp is the best suitor for Qualcomm Inc’s chip unit, if the maker of Snapdragon mobile processors decides to break itself up. “The chip deal to end all chip deals,” says Cowen and Co analyst Timothy Arcuri, would give Intel’s smartphone chip making business a much-needed boost. It would also allow Intel to expand its footprint in the key Chinese market. Other suitors for Qualcomm’s chip business, valued at $30 billion-$40 billion, could include a consortium backed by the Chinese government and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. Qualcomm said on Wednesday that it was weighing a possible separation of its two businesses, a move prompted by activist shareholder Jana Partners, which had a 1.7 percent stake in the company as of March 31. The maker of computing and communication chips for mobile devices has been losing ground to Asian rivals such as MediaTek Inc, whose cheaper versions have given them an edge in the price-conscious Asian market. Longtime customer Samsung’s decision to use its own chips in its flagship Galaxy S6 smartphone instead of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon has added to the company’s woes. A deal with Intel, which has its own foundries, will help Qualcomm cut costs and price its chips more competitively. “... This would catapult Intel into the leadership position and give it diversity away from PCs that it very much needs,” Ascendiant Capital Markets analyst Cody Acree said. Intel and Qualcomm declined to comment. Cowen’s Timothy Arcuri said the business could be worth about $20 per share — less than a third of Qualcomm’s current share price — and Intel could offer $25 per share.     But Arcuri and several other analysts are not sure a split makes sense in the first place. Qualcomm funnels licensing profits into the chip business and a possible split raises questions about the unit’s ability to sustain itself as an independent entity. “... We worry that the loss of its golden goose would seriously harm (the chip unit’s) ability to dramatically out-spend competitors on research and development,” Arcuri said. Drexel Hamilton analyst Richard Whittington said Qualcomm was unlikely to go through with the split, but if it did, Intel would be a good fit. “I can’t see how they can possibly segregate the two. Whatever short term gain is derived, would be more than made up with permanent loss of market share in ... two to three years,” he said, adding that Qualcomm could instead look to partner with Intel or smaller Chinese and Korean companies.

971,INTC,UPDATE 2-Nvidia's gaming chips drive surprise rise in revenue,"* Q2 rev up 4.5 pct vs estimates of 8 pct fall * Forecasts Q3 rev to fall less than analysts expect * Q2 gaming revenue up 59 pct on strong chip demand * Automotive rev soars 76 pct, enterprise rev down 14 pct * Shares rise more than 9 pct after-market   (Adds analyst comment, details from conference call, updates shares) By Kshitiz Goliya Aug 6 (Reuters) - Nvidia Corp reported a surprise rise in second-quarter revenue and gave a better-than-expected revenue forecast for the current quarter, helped by strong demand for its graphic chips used in gaming and cars. The company’s shares rose nearly 10 percent in extended trading on Thursday. Nvidia’s revenue increased 4.5 percent in the quarter ended July 26, while analysts on average were expecting revenue to decrease about 8 percent. The company forecast sales would fall in the third quarter, but the decline was again less than analysts’ expectations. Nvidia gets a majority of its revenue from its graphic chips made for personal computers, and there were fears that the fall in PC sales would hurt Nvidia just like it has Intel Corp  and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. But, Nvidia said gaming revenue rose 59 percent, helped by strong sales of its popular GeForce series of gaming chips. “The near term story continues to be PC gaming,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Betsy Van Hees. “That is the key driver for them and they continue to dominate in that area.” Nvidia has also been increasing its focus on making chips that allows people to play graphics-heavy games over the internet and chips used in a car’s dashboard display and in self-driving cars. Automotive revenue rose 76 percent in the quarter and accounted for only 6.2 percent of total revenue. The company said 8 million cars on the road were using its chips and that it was working with more than 50 companies for its DRIVE chip for self-driving cars. Van Hees said car chips would be a very important long-term story. However, revenue in Nvidia’s enterprise business fell 14 percent. The business, which makes chips used for software such as AutoCAD, accounted for 16.2 percent of total revenue. The company’s total revenue rose 4.5 percent to $1.15 billion in the second quarter. Analysts had expected $1.01 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income slumped nearly 80 percent to $26 million in the quarter due to higher costs and a bigger tax bill. Nvidia forecast revenue to fall to $1.16-$1.20 billion in the current quarter from $1.23 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected a fall to $1.10 billion. Nvidia’s shares rose 9.7 percent to $22.43 in extended trading. They had risen nearly 2 percent this year through Thursday, compared with a 11.6 percent fall in the Dow Jones US chip index.

975,INTC,CORRECTED-US STOCKS-Wall St flat as commodities' rise offsets weak factory data,"(Corrects Reuters Instrument Code for materials sector in paragraph 8) * China factory data at 6-1/2-yr low, U.S. at 2-yr low * Copper prices rebound, Brent rises toward $50 a barrel * Intel up after Bernstein rating upgrade * Indexes: Dow up 0.14 pct, S&P; flat, Nasdaq up 0.08 pct By Abhiram Nandakumar and Tanya Agrawal Sept 23 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were little changed in light trading on Wednesday morning as a rebound in commodity prices helped soften the impact of weak factory data out of China and the United States. Copper bounced from near four-week lows as short sellers took profits. Brent crude oil prices inched toward $50 per barrel after data showed a decline in U.S. stockpiles last week. Growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector showed no month-over-month change in September, staying at its weakest in almost two years, according to an industry report. Data showed Chinese factory activity shrank to a 6-1/2 year low in September, falling for the seventh month in a row in the world’s second-biggest economy. “There is unbridled fear that China is slipping into a recession and will take the rest of the world with it,” said Scott Schermerhorn, chief investment officer at Granite Investment Advisors. “I don’t think it is true but investors are operating in pure fear-driven mode.” At 10:17 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones industrial average  was down 23.47 points, or 0.14 percent, at 16,307. The S&P; 500  was up 0.01 points, at 1,942.75 and the Nasdaq Composite  was up 3.77 points, or 0.08 percent, at 4,760.49. Six of the 10 major S&P; sectors were lower with the material sector’s 0.4 percent loss leading the decliner. Health stocks continued their decline, with the Nasdaq biotech index  down 1 percent. Schermerhorn said volatility was likely to continue until the third-quarter corporate earnings season, and that valuations remained reasonable and represented a good buying opportunity. The CBOE Volatility index <.VIX >, popularly known as the “fear gauge”, was up 0.5 percent at 22.54, above its long-term average of 20. The volatility in the U.S. stock market has increased since Aug. 20 as investors fret over a China-led global economic slowdown and the timing of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike. But, the Fed’s decision last week to hold interest rates steady at near-zero levels has only increased uncertainty. Intel was up 0.5 percent at $28.80 after Bernstein upgraded the stock to “marketperform” from “underperform”. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,443 to 1,318. On the Nasdaq, 1,316 issues rose and 1,119 fell. The S&P; 500 index showed no new 52-week highs and 13 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 14 new highs and 46 new lows.

981,INTC,Intel says data center business to grow less than expected,"(Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) cut revenue growth forecast for its highly profitable business of making chips for data centers as businesses reduce spending due to weak macroeconomic growth. The world’s biggest chipmaker’s shares reversed course to trade down as much as 3.8 percent after the bell on Tuesday following the forecast. Intel has been counting on the data center business to help offset declining demand for its chips used in personal computers, its biggest revenue generator. The company agreed in June to acquire Altera Corp (ALTR.O) for $16.7 billion to expand its line-up of the higher-margin chips used in data centers. Intel said on Tuesday it expected the data center business to grow in “low double digits” in 2015, compared with its earlier forecast of about 15 percent growth. The business, the company’s second biggest, had grown 19.2 percent in the first quarter, 9.7 percent in the second and 12 percent in the latest quarter.  The company was not “rethinking the long-term growth” of the business, Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on a post-earnings conference call. “It’s a combination of two things — data center weakness and units — it looks like their units are still pretty weak, they are seeing upside from pricing,” analyst Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein said. The weak data center forecast took the shine away from the company’s better-than-expected profit and revenue in the third quarter. The company also trimmed its 2015 capital expenditure for the third time to $7.3 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Intel had previously forecast capital expenditure of $7.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million. The company said it expected fourth-quarter revenue of $14.8 billion, plus or minus $500 million. The midpoint of the range is a marginal increase from a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $14.83 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

985,INTC,Intel's data center business seen rebounding in 2016,"(Reuters) - Intel Corp’s move to cut growth forecast for its highly profitable business that makes chips used in data centers may have disappointed investors, but analysts see the unit rebounding next year as more users take to cloud services. Expanding the business is critical to Intel’s efforts to reducing its dependence on the PC market, which has been shrinking for almost four years. Buying Altera Corp earlier this year was a step in this direction. Intel said on Tuesday it expected the data center unit to grow in “low double digits” on a percentage basis in 2015, compared with its earlier forecast of about 15 percent, as businesses cut spending. Worldwide IT spending on data center systems is expected to fall 3.8 percent in $142 billion this year, research firm Gartner said in June, citing a strong dollar. “Perhaps the revelation of low double-digit was a little worse than people had expected, but this is a long-term phenomenon for them whereby this group has finally gained critical mass,” FBR Capital Markets analyst Christopher Rolland told Reuters. The data center group comprised about 29 percent of the company’s total revenue in the third quarter ended Sept. 26. Analysts expect the business to account for about 40 percent of the total by 2017. Rolland said investors should not over-react to what was just a trimming of the growth outlook for the business. Analysts said Intel’s data center business was strong enough to withstand the concerns of weakness in the broader economy. Deutsche Bank Markets Research analysts noted that while the data center group has slowed due to enterprise weakness, it is still growing at double-digits on a percentage basis. Some analysts, however, said the forecast cut could be indicative of weak growth going ahead into 2016. “Data center expectations were stepped down meaningfully exiting the year, and we believe the trajectory in 2016 carries meaningful risk,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a note. Some expect growth to remain in the low double-digit range. “(DCG) is still a very good business, but we think growth will be more in the 10-12 percent range, leaving overall corporate revenue growth in the low single digits,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note. Up to Tuesday’s close of $32.04, Intel’s stock had fallen 11.7 percent this year, compared with a 9.4 percent fall in the broader semiconductor index.

990,INTC,UPDATE 1-Chipmaker TSMC cuts 2015 capex by over 20 pct on weak global demand,"* Cuts annual capex to four-year low * Says continuing inventory adjustments to weigh on Q4 revenue * Move comes after Intel slices capex   (Adds context, quotes) By J.R. Wu TAIPEI, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) on Thursday slashed its annual capital expenditure by over a fifth to a four-year low as weak demand, particularly from China, prompted it to reschedule investment plans. TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker which counts Apple Inc as a client, also cut its 2015 outlook for the global semiconductor industry growth to zero from a previously forecast 4 percent, days after rival Intel Corp  also cut its capex and revenue growth forecast, citing weakness in the global economy. TSMC said its capex for this year would total about $8 billion, down from the $10.5 billion to $11 billion estimate it made in April. The capex forecast would be the lowest since 2011, TSMC said. “This year’s $8 billion is kind of low, but next year is expected to be higher,” Chief Financial Officer Lora Ho told an earnings briefing, adding that it was too soon to give estimates for 2016. Ho said TSMC had lowered its estimate partly due to the sluggish demand outlook from China, where the economy is growing at its slowest pace in nearly a quarter of a century, and not because of a loss in client orders. Cost savings, and forex-related gains, also helped the company reduce its capex, she added. China’s smartphone market, the world’s largest, shrank in early 2015 for the first time in six years. TSMC, which posted a 5.1 percent quarter-on-quarter drop in third quarter net profit, said it expects revenue for the fourth quarter to range between T$201 billion ($6.3 billion) and T$204 billion, lower than the previous three-month period. Inventory reduction will continue to weigh on revenue growth in the fourth quarter, said Mark Liu, TSMC’s co-chief executive officer.

991,INTC,Intel says may invest up to $5.5 billion in China memory chip plant,"(Reuters) - Intel Corp said it may invest up to $5.5 billion in manufacturing semiconductors in China, stepping up efforts to improve ties with Beijing as it seeks new revenue streams while demand for its core computer processing chips falters. The U.S. firm said it would convert a facility in Dalian, its first plant in China, for memory chip production. It didn’t disclose a time period for the investment, but said it will start making advanced memory chips that can store data without using up power, called 3D NAND chips, in second-half 2016. The move follows a flurry of deals in the global semiconductor industry, highlighting growing importance of the memory chips used to store data in increasingly popular mobile devices. Researcher TrendForce predicts China will consume $6.67 billion worth of NAND chips this year, or 29 percent of global NAND industry revenue.      Building a chip industry of its own has been deemed of strategic importance by China in its drive to modernize its economy. Intel’s new investment follows a deal last year to buy 20 percent stake of two mobile chipmakers owned by state-backed Tsinghua Holdings Co Ltd [TSHUAA.UL]. For its part Tsinghua recently announced a plan to buy a 15 percent stake in U.S. data storage company Western Digital Corp for $3.8 billion. In separate deals, Western Digital is also in advanced talks to acquire U.S. memory chipmaker SanDisk Corp, while Tsinghua is also trying to acquire Micron, though this deal is facing regulatory scrutiny. Intel’s latest move raises concerns that new memory supply from the chipmaker could undercut margins for leading industry players like South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and SK Hynix Inx, and Japan’s Toshiba Corp.    Analysts have said that healthy profits for the industry in recent quarters come partly due to careful capacity management among the dominant players. Shares of SK Hynix fell 5.7 percent on Wednesday on concerns about the firm’s outlook. The South Korean firm is due to report third-quarter earnings on Thursday. “SK Hynix needs to boost competitiveness for its NAND business but these issues are creating problems for the company,” said Hana Financial Investment analyst Rokho Kim.

998,INTC,Intel to follow Apple in crucial test of Kangaroo market,"SYDNEY, Nov 17 (IFR) - Intel Corporation, rated A1/A+ (Moody’s/S&P;), has sparked plenty of excitement in Australia ahead of tomorrow’s fixed-income investor call for a potential debut offering of Kangaroo bonds. The US technology giant has only issued bonds in US dollars previously, so to make Australia its first offshore port of call would represent another coup for the Kangaroo market following on from Apple’s A$2.25 billion ($1.58 billion) blowout three-tranche trade in August. Given that all of Intel’s US dollar bond issues have been for $1 billion or more, expectations are centring on an inaugural Kangaroo trade of at least A$1 billion to make it worthwhile, according to a DCM banker not involved in the transaction. Apple’s sale dwarfed all previous Australian dollar offerings from non-financial companies, raising hopes for a decisive broadening of Australia’s underutilised fixed-income market. The previous largest corporate Australian dollar bond offerings were two A$1 billion trades from local mining giant BHP Billiton. Prior to Apple the biggest pure corporate Kangaroo issuance was for A$500 million, although SABMiller, the London-based global brewer, raised A$700 million from what was technically a domestic five-year trade on July 31 this year, issued through FBG Treasury (Aust). Intel, which is a major Apple supplier, returned to its domestic bond market for the first time since 2012 in the third quarter of this year when it raised $8 billion to help fund its $16.7 billion acquisition of Altera Corp agreed earlier in 2015. On the buy side, the Australian dollar bond market is dominated by banks and mining companies in the corporate space, making investors very keen, as Apple confirmed, to get their hands on rare, blue-chip technology paper, although pricing is still all important. Crucially, Apple priced in line with its US dollar curve and just inside its euro curve while offering healthy pick-ups over Australian comparables which persuaded domestic fund managers to lap up 60% of its bonds. Pricing is unlikely to be so compelling for Intel Kangaroo bonds, however, given that the company’s $1.75 billion 2.45 percent July 29 2020 bond swaps back below the current 108bp BBSW/asset swaps clearing rate for new five-year senior unsecured bonds issued by Australia’s four higher-rated (Aa2/AA-/AA-) major banks. A leading Australian fund manager stressed that major banks do not represent the lowest acceptable limit for new corporate issuers, especially if they provide additional value in terms of portfolio diversification. “An Intel bond may not be a screaming buy in purely pricing terms but it offers other portfolio advantages while we still have to find out from the company why it is interested in issuing Kangaroos as well as the level of any new issue premium it may provide,” he said. A syndication manager pointed out that the market has become more challenging since Apple visited Down Under. “Several investors have become risk-averse in recent months and are now only interested in the five-year segment and/or issues that offer decent new issue concession to help contain downside risk,” he said. Deutsche Bank, a joint lead manager with CBA and Goldman Sachs for the Apple Kangaroo, is arranging tomorrow’s investor call with Westpac. The group call will be held at 11:30 Sydney time (00:30 GMT) to be followed by one-on-one discussions.

1001,INTC,Fitch Rates Intel's AUD4B Kangaroo Bonds Offering 'A+',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 23 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+' rating to Intel  Corp.'s (Intel) 4-year and 7-year senior notes issuance in Australia. Fitch  currently rates Intel's long- and short-term Issuer Default Ratings 'A+/F1'. The  Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch rates $22.2 billion of debt, prior to the  issuance. A full list of current ratings follows at the end of this release.  With the AUD senior notes sale, Intel will complete the debt component funding  for the company's $16.7 billion acquisition of Altera Corp. (Altera), which is  expected to close by the end of 2015. The AUD notes sale follows Intel's $8  billion of notes issuance in July 2015.  This amount is well below Fitch's original expectation of nearly $15 billion and  has been driven by stronger than anticipated domestic free cash flow (FCF) since  the acquisition announcement. Fitch estimates total leverage (total debt to  operating EBITDA) of 0.9x at closing versus prior expectations for just over 1x.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings and Outlook reflect Fitch's belief that Intel's operating profile  will remain strong and credit protection measures solid for the rating, despite  incremental debt issuance to fund the Altera acquisition. Longer-term, Altera  should strengthen Intel's offerings in data center and internet of things (IoT)  markets. Altera is a leading provider of field programmable logic devices (PLD) with 39%  share in the $5 billion PLD market. By combining Intel's processors and Altera's  PLDs on a lower-cost and better-performing single die, Intel hopes to accelerate  growth in data center and take share from application-specific solutions  providers in rapidly growing IoT markets.  Altera adds nearly $2 billion of revenues with gross profit margins in the  mid-60s, slightly higher than those of Intel, with meaningfully lower capital  intensity as a fabless semiconductor marker. In addition, Intel and Altera's  existing foundry relationship and design collaboration with Altera may reduce  integration risk.  With Fitch's expectations for more than $5 billion of annual free cash flow  (FCF), domestic FCF over the next two to three quarters prior to the  acquisition's close could reduce the amount of new debt to fund the purchase  price. Fitch also expects the company will moderate share repurchases to  maintain conservative total leverage. The ratings are supported by:  --Intel microprocessor's dominance and clear and significant technology  leadership, particularly in manufacturing. Intel's x86 processor architecture is  also the premiere platform for data center/servers, providing the company a  significant advantage in the enterprise and cloud-computing space.  --Broad geographic and business diversification. Although the majority of the  company's revenue is derived from PC and server demand, these markets are driven  by different secular growth trends which Fitch expects to contribute to  longer-term stability.  --Continued long-term secular growth in digitalization and computer adoption  worldwide as well as greater penetration of microprocessors in areas outside of  traditional computing.  Rating concerns include:  --Intel's exposure to the cyclical demand for semiconductors which is typically  exacerbated at the beginning of cyclical downturns due to channel inventory  contraction.  --Significant and fixed investment intensity, including research and development  (R&D;) and capital spending. Intel's leading profit margins largely compensate  for this risk although capital spending has at times approached 50% of operating  EBITDA.  --Intel has significant customer concentration with its largest customers  accounting for 40% of total revenues. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Slightly down organic revenue growth in fiscal 2015, driven by weaker than  expected personal computer (PC) demand that will be partially offset by  continued strength in data center server chips.  --Beyond the near term, organic revenue growth in the low-single digits, driven  by solid data center-related demand and, to a lesser extent, Intel's strategy to  combine both processers and PLDs on a single die. --Consistent profitability through the forecast period, due to a more stable  pricing environment and Intel's manufacturing cost leadership.  --Annual capital spending of $9 billion to $10 billion and more than $11 billion  of annual R&D; investments through the intermediate term to support the  continuation of Moore's Law. RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative rating actions could result from: --Fitch's expectation that total leverage will remain above 1.25x, driven by a  more aggressive share repurchases and/or greater acquisition activity to build  Intel's mobility segment;  --Fitch's expectation for normalized FCF to adjusted debt approaching 20%, as a  result of continued tablet cannibalization of PC sales, and lack of penetration  into the mobile market.  Positive rating action is unlikely, given the cyclicality and volatility  inherent in the semiconductor business, as well as the need for flexibility in  managing technological changes and challenges. A positive rating action would  likely require:  --Profitability improvement across mobility businesses in line with competitors,  signifying improved competitiveness and increased market share within the space.  --An explicit commitment to a leverage ratio of 1x or below. LIQUIDITY Liquidity as of Sept. 26, 2015 was solid and consisted of: --$20.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, $10.1  billion of which was located outside the U.S.;  --$5 billion commercial paper (CP) program with no outstanding balance.  Fitch's expectation for more than $5 billion of annual FCF also supports  liquidity. The company does not have a revolving credit facility to support its  CP program, but Fitch views Intel's strong liquidity as providing ample support  for the program.  Total debt as of Sept. 26, 2015 was $21.2 billion and primarily consisted of:  --$1.5 billion of 1.95% senior notes due October 2016;  --$3 billion of 1.35% senior notes due December 2017;  --$1.7 billion of 2.45% senior notes due Juley 2020; --$2 billion in 3.3% senior notes due October 2021;  --$1 billion of 3.1% senior notes due July 2022; --$1.5 billion of 2.7% senior notes due December 2022;  --$2.2 billion of 3.7% senior notes due July 2025; --$750 million of 4% senior notes due December 2032;  --$975 million principal value of 2.95% junior subordinated debentures due  December 2035;  --$1.1 billion principal value of 3.25% junior subordinated debentures due  August 2039;  --$1.5 billion of 4.8% senior notes due October 2041;  --$924 million of 4.25% senior notes due December 2042; --$2 billion of 4.9% senior notes due July 2045; --$1 billion of 4.9% senior notes due August 2045.  FULL LIST OF RATINGS  Fitch currently rates Intel Corp. as follows: --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A+';  --Short-term IDR 'F1';  --$5 billion CP program 'F1';  --Senior unsecured notes 'A+';  --Junior subordinated notes 'A'.

1003,INTC,Slowing data center revenue growth dims Intel's profit beat,"(Reuters) - Intel Corp’s (INTC.O) strong quarterly profit beat was overshadowed by concerns about slowing revenue growth in its highly profitable data center business, sending its shares down about 5.6 percent in after-market trading. Chief Executive Brian Krzanich has looked to weather a slump in demand for chips used in personal computers by focusing on the business of supplying chips for high-end servers. The world’s largest chipmaker reported data center revenue of $4.31 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 26, missing consensus estimate of $4.42 billion, according to Jefferies & Co.  Revenue in the business rose only 4 percent from the preceding quarter, compared with the 8 percent growth in the third quarter. “I think companies are probably not upgrading their own data center as they know they are eventually going to convert to the cloud,” said Kevin Cassidy, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus and Co Inc. “So they are going to put Band-Aids on their current servers and not upgrade them,” Cassidy said. In October, Intel had cut its 2015 revenue growth forecast for the data center business, as companies slash spending due to weak macroeconomic growth. Excluding items, Intel forecast revenue of $14.1 billion, plus or minus $500 million for the first quarter ending March. The midpoint of this range is down 6 percent from the fourth quarter, the company said.   “While the outlook for the first quarter reflects some caution for overall demand, particularly in China, we continue to expect solid growth in the business in 2016,” Krzanich said on a post-earnings call. Revenue in the personal computer business fell about 1 percent to $8.76 billion from a year earlier.  Global personal computer shipments fell 10.6 percent in the quarter ended in December from a year earlier, IDC said on Tuesday, the largest decline since the research firm started tracking PC shipments.    The fourth quarter of 2015 marked the fifth consecutive quarter of worldwide PC shipments decline, according to rival research firm Gartner.  Intel completed its $16.7 billion purchase of programmable-chip maker Altera Corp in December, a deal that adds a new class of products to Intel’s portfolio.  The company's net income fell to $3.61 billion from $3.66 billion in the fourth quarter. (bit.ly/1mYZC4o) On a per share basis, earnings were flat at 74 cents. Net revenue rose to $14.91 billion from $14.72 billion. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 63 cents per share and revenue of $14.80 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Pain was dealt widely, with the day’s trading volume unusually high and more than a fifth of S&P; 500 stocks touching 52-week lows. The major S&P; sectors all ended sharply lower. The Russell 2000 small-cap index dropped as much as 3.5 percent to its lowest level since July 2013. The energy sector dropped 2.87 percent as oil prices fell 6.5 percent, in part due to fears of slow economic growth in China, where major stock indexes also slumped overnight. The energy sector has lost nearly half of its value after hitting record highs in late 2014. “Initially when oil was down, the convenient line was ‘Well, it’s good for the other nine sectors,” said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. “That tune has changed. Now, it’s a contagion to the other nine sectors. It’s a contagion to Main Street and Wall Street.” The technology sector was the day’s biggest loser, sliding 3.15 percent as weak quarterly results from chipmaker Intel weighed heavily on chip stocks. The S&P; 500 has fallen about 12 percent from its high in May, pushing it into what is generally considered “correction territory.” China’s major stock indexes shed over 3 percent, raising questions about Beijing’s ability to halt a sell-off that has now reached 18 percent since the beginning of the year. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 2.39 percent to end at 15,988.08 points and the S&P; 500 fell 2.16 percent to 1,880.29. The Nasdaq Composite lost 2.74 percent to 4,488.42. For the week, the Dow fell 2.2 percent, the S&P; 500 lost 2.2 percent and the Nasdaq dropped 3.3 percent. During Friday’s session, the CBOE volatility index, Wall Street’s fear gauge, jumped as much as 29.2 percent to 30.95, its highest level since September. “Investors are scared to death, and the fact that it’s happening at the beginning of the year has some historical significance,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York. U.S. economic data on Friday was not very encouraging either, with an unexpected drop in retail sales and industrial output declining again in December, underscoring a worsening outlook for fourth-quarter economic growth. Dow components Exxon and Chevron were down more than 1 percent, while Caterpillar dropped 2.65 percent. Intel tumbled 9.1 percent, its steepest drop in seven years, after the chipmaker’s results and forecast raised concerns about its growth. Citigroup fell 6.41 percent, while Wells Fargo  dropped 3.59 percent after both reported largely in-line quarterly earnings. Wynn Resorts was the among the few bright spots, surging 13.34 percent after reporting in-line quarterly revenue. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,591 to 529. On the Nasdaq, 2,377 issues fell and 502 rose. The S&P; 500 index showed no new 52-week highs and 135 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded five new highs and 511 lows. About 10.8 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, well above the 7.6 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

1009,INTC,Coca-Cola hopes to refresh corporate Kangaroo market,"SYDNEY, Feb 16 (IFR) - The Coca-Cola Company  (Aa3/AA/A+) looks set to provide the first real test of the year for the corporate Kangaroo market, having mandated Deutsche Bank to arrange investor meetings from March 7 for a potential debut trade. The stellar A$2.25 billion ($1.59 billion) triple-tranche issue last August from Apple, rated Aa1/AA+ (Moody’s/S&P;), raised hopes that Australia would become a key second-tier destination for overseas credits, alongside the sterling, Swiss franc and Canadian dollar markets. Intel, rated A1/A+ (Moody’s/S&P;), followed three months later with a slightly underwhelming inaugural A$800 million dual-tranche sale, which, despite being the second-largest corporate Kangaroo, failed to match hopes for a A$1 billion-plus issue. Intel’s average order sizes were back at the typical A$20 million-A$50 million levels rather than the bumper Apple tickets of up to A$150 million, as the world’s biggest chip-maker struggled amid a more difficult market backdrop than the one Apple had faced. Limited credit analyst coverage among Australian fund managers also weighed on the Intel trade, while several Asian investors felt the pick-up offered over Intel’s US dollar curve was insufficient to compensate for the lower liquidity in the Australian market. The latter is a particularly important consideration during times of global market stress. Local funds are more familiar with Coca Cola, especially with regional bottler Coca-Cola Amatil, rated A3/A- (Moody’s/S&P;), having previously issued Australian dollar bonds, including a A$150 million seven-year MTN in November 2012. With the Aussie dollar, a proxy for China risk, now trading at around 70 US cents after being near parity between October 2010 and October 2014, a Kangaroo issue must now exceed A$700 million to reach the equivalent US dollar benchmark size of $500 million. It will be a very impressive result if Coca-Cola matches the size of its first Matterhorn transaction in September 2015, a SFr1.325 billion ($1.345 billion) three-trancher. Coca-Cola debuted in the euro market 12 months earlier with a 2 billion euro ($2.23 billion) dual-trancher and followed up with a whopping 8.5 billion euro five-note issue last February. The company, historically a large issuer, printed its last US dollar transaction in October 2015 with a $4 billion SEC-registered three-part senior unsecured offering. Deutsche Bank’s role as arranger for the Coca-Cola roadshow underlines its position as the go-to international bank for US corporate blue chips looking to visit Down Under. Deutsche was joint lead manager for the Apple Kangaroo with CBA and Goldman Sachs and also led the Intel debut alongside Westpac. Although the Korea National Oil Corporation A$325 million three-year floating-rate-note sale on February 2 was technically 2016’s first corporate Kangaroo, the state-owned company is seen as sovereign rather than corporate risk, while only 2 percent of the bonds were allocated to Australasian investors.

1013,INTC,UPDATE 6-U.S. curbs China's ZTE exports over Iran business allegations,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A new U.S. export restriction against China’s ZTE Corp (000063.SZ) for alleged Iran sanctions violations is likely to disrupt the telecom manufacturer’s sprawling global supply chain and could create substantial parts shortages, according to sanctions experts. Under the measure announced by the Commerce Department on Monday, U.S. manufacturers will be banned from selling components to ZTE, which is a major global supplier of telecom-networking equipment. In addition, foreign manufacturers will be prohibited from selling products containing a significant amount of U.S.-made parts to the Chinese company. The Commerce Department, confirming the decision that was first reported by Reuters on Saturday, said ZTE planned to use a series of shell companies “to illicitly reexport controlled items to Iran in violation of U.S. export control laws.” It said ZTE acted “contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.” While ZTE suppliers can apply for an export license to ship any American-made equipment or parts, the Commerce Department said such license applications generally will be denied.    The export restriction, which does not stop ZTE from selling handsets in the United States, is expected to have a global impact. “It is going to have a large ripple effect. It’s very significant to many companies both in the U.S. and (outside the) U.S.,” said Doug Jacobson, an export attorney at law firm Jacobson Burton Kelley PLLC, who said he has been fielding calls from clients who supply ZTE since Reuters broke news of the impending export restrictions. For example, a Taiwanese chipmaker that uses American-made components to make processors for ZTE handsets would likely have to cut off those sales. If the Taiwanese supplier only procures components from outside the United States it can continue to sell to ZTE, experts said. “I am telling all my clients today that anything (for ZTE)not already on board an airplane going to China, you cannot ship it starting tonight. They have to scrub and screen their customers lists – pending orders and future orders – to make sure that any transactions with ZTE are flagged and stopped.” ZTE, which has annual sales of more than $15 billion and is the only Chinese smartphone maker with a meaningful presence in the U.S. market, can appeal the decision. ZTE is among the largest companies that the Commerce Department has hit with a near-total export ban, according to public records. In 2014, the department restricted exports to Russian energy companies Lukoil OAO and Gazprom OAO, but those restrictions only stopped American companies from supplying certain types of oil-production projects, such as Arctic offshore and deepwater drilling.   ZTE is the No. 4 smartphone vendor in the United States, with a 7 percent market share, behind Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Samsung Electronics Co (005930.KS) and LG Electronics Inc (066570.KS), according to research firm IDC. It sells handset devices to three of the four largest U.S. mobile carriers - AT&T; (T.N), T-Mobile US (TMUS.O) and Sprint Corp (S.N). Although ZTE is not being banned from selling handsets in the United States, the restriction could disrupt handset production if ZTE sources U.S.-made parts to manufacture its handsets, experts said. AT&T; declined to comment, and T-Mobile and Sprint did not respond to requests for comment. A ZTE website states that several leading U.S. technology companies, including Microsoft (MSFT.O), Intel Corp (INTC.O), IBM (IBM.N) and Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), are “key strategic partners.”  Intel and Qualcomm confirmed they were ZTE suppliers, but did not elaborate on specific products sold to the Chinese company or how sanctions would affect their businesses. Texas Instruments (TXN.O), which has also said it provides processors for the Chinese company, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The impact of the new restrictions on these three companies was not immediately clear as most of them produce components both in the United States and overseas. Microsoft, in an emailed statement, said, “We follow U.S. law and will review new U.S. restrictions.” A spokeswoman for Microsoft said the company had a licensing agreement with ZTE but could not confirm if ZTE purchases other products, such as software. The other U.S. companies did not respond to requests for comment. The U.S. decision could even prompt suppliers to halt sales of non-U.S. components that are still allowed, said Kay Georgi, an export attorney at law firm Arent Fox LLP. “When you get placed on one of these lists nobody wants to do business with you at all,” Georgi said.  The United States has long banned the sale of U.S.-made technology products to Iran as part of its sanctions, even as China maintains close diplomatic, economic, trade and energy ties with Tehran. Last year, the United States and major world powers reached a deal with Iran to loosen economic sanctions in exchange for Tehran curbing its nuclear program. “We hope this sends a strong message to ZTE, to China, and to other Chinese telecommunications companies who present serious national security risks not only by evading export controls, but by purposefully compromising supply chain security,” said Representative Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee.

1018,INTC,"Intel mastermind, Silicon Valley statesman Andy Grove dead at 79","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Andy Grove, the Silicon Valley elder statesman who made Intel into the world’s top chipmaker and helped usher in the personal computer age, died on Tuesday at age 79, Intel said. The company did not describe the circumstances of his death but Grove, who endured the Nazi occupation of Hungary during World War Two, living under a fake name, and came to the United States to escape the chaos of Soviet rule, had suffered from Parkinson’s. Grove was Intel’s first hire after it was founded in 1968 and became the practical-minded member of a triumvirate that eventually led “Intel Inside” processors to be used in more than 80 percent of the world’s personal computers. With his motto “only the paranoid survive,” which became the title of his best-selling management book, Grove championed an innovative environment within Intel that became a blueprint for successful California startups. Grove, who was named man of the year by Time magazine in 1997, encouraged disagreement and insisted employees be vigilant of disruptions in industry and technology that could be major dangers - or opportunities - for Intel. In doing so, he could be mercurial and demanding with employees who he thought were not doing enough and in 1981 required the staff to work two extra hours a day with no extra pay. Grove’s overhaul of Intel’s business - switching from digital memory to processors - was an early example of his obsession with detecting major shifts in business and technology and staying flexible enough to move quickly and make the most of them. “It’s not that you shouldn’t plan but you should not regard your plans to be anything more than a baseline model of what might happen,” Grove said. While Intel founders Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore proposed much of the chip technology that helped created the semiconductor industry, Grove was the stickler for detail who turned their ideas into actual products. He was responsible for driving growth in Intel’s profits and stock price through the 1980s and 1990s.     Grove, who was Jewish, was born Andras Grof in Budapest in 1936. Nazi Germany occupied Hungary in his youth, and after the Soviets followed, Grove sneaked into Austria in 1956 and then emigrated to the United States, where he learned English and earned a Ph.D. in chemical engineering from the University of California at Berkeley. Grove went to work in 1963 at Fairchild Semiconductor, where he researched technology that would eventually be used to make microchips. At Fairchild, he also met chip visionaries Noyce and Moore, who left to found Intel in 1968. Grove quickly joined them, running research and manufacturing. He became Intel’s president in 1979, CEO in 1987 and chairman and CEO in 1997. He gave up his CEO title in 1998 and stayed on as chairman until 2004.  In its early years, Intel focused on making DRAM memory chips. When Japanese competition soared, Grove made the fateful decision to reinvent Intel as a manufacturer of microprocessors – the brains at the center of personal computers and other electronic devices. As the personal computer industry took off in the 1980s, Intel supplied its processors to IBM and then to Compaq and other manufacturers making “IBM clone” PCs.  Intel’s chips, along with Microsoft’s Windows operating system, quickly became an industry standard in the exploding PC industry, with Grove funneling profits into research and development to create faster and faster processors. Under his stewardship, the Pentium brand and “Intel Inside” logo became widely recognized by consumers. Intel remains one of the world’s leading semiconductor companies but the PC chipmaker is wrestling to adapt to trends toward smaller gadgets like smartphones and tablets. Grove also was a champion of keeping manufacturing within the United States, arguing outsourcing the manufacturing of electronics products - like batteries or televisions - meant U.S. companies missed out on gaining experience necessary to make technology breakthroughs. Intel still makes most of its chips in U.S. plants. During his time at Intel in the 1990s Grove was treated for prostate cancer and later wrote an influential cover story in Fortune magazine, criticizing the medical establishment’s treatment of the disease as inefficient compared to scientific standards applied in semiconductor research. In later life, Grove donated tens of millions of dollars for research on Parkinson’s disease, a condition he suffered from. He also regularly criticized government and medical researchers for making slow and inefficient progress beating that disease compared to accomplishments made in the chip industry. Grove and his wife, Eva, who married a year after meeting while working at a resort in New Hampshire in 1957, had two daughters.

1023,INTC,"Verizon bets on Armstrong, M&A; savvy in Yahoo bid","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) is the clear favorite in the upcoming bidding for Yahoo Inc’s YHOO.O core Internet business, according to Wall Street analysts, in large part because the telecommunications company’s efforts to become a force in Internet content have gone relatively well under the leadership of AOL Inc Chief Executive Tim Armstrong. Verizon acquired AOL last June for $4.4 billion - its first big foray into the advertising-supported Internet business - and it is not yet clear how well the unit is performing financially. Subsequent moves, including the takeover of much of Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT.O) advertising technology business, a deal to buy Millennial Media for about $250 million and the recent launch of the mobile video service go90, are also too recent to assess. Yet analysts have given the big phone company high marks for allowing AOL to operate independently and folding in other recent acquisitions without much drama. And they said Armstrong seems to be driving Verizon’s recent moves in go90 and recent acquisitions.  “The management puts a lot of faith in Armstrong,” BTIG analyst Walt Piecyk said.  That faith derives in part from the belief that Armstrong did a good job at left-for-dead AOL, especially in assembling a strong set of products to deliver targeted digital ads to customers. Combining AOL and Yahoo, an idea that has come up many times over the years, could instantly make Yahoo a major player in Internet advertising, with Armstrong - one of the world’s top ad executives - at the helm, analysts said.  Armstrong “has good M&A; experience, and a pretty solid ad tech stack,” B. Riley & Co analyst Sameet Sinha said.  Verizon’s hands-off approach that has worked with AOL, though, might not be suitable if the far-bigger Yahoo were taken over. With Yahoo’s struggling business, “the luxury of autonomy is simply not there,” Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner said.   Verizon, AOL and Yahoo declined to comment. Verizon showed interest in Yahoo’s core business as early as December, when Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said the company would “see if there is a strategic fit” for Yahoo’s holdings, which include mail, news, sports and advertising technology. Yahoo, under pressure from activist investors, launched an auction of its core business in February after it shelved plans to spin off its stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N).  The first round of bidding is slated for next week, and Verizon plans to make a bid, sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters. Verizon is already working on increasing revenue through its ad-supported mobile video service go90, targeted at millennials and built on video streaming technology acquired from Intel Corp (INTC.O) in 2014. The app, which launched in October, offers videos from Comedy Central and Vice, among others, as well as basketball and football games.  However, analysts cautioned that even a combined Yahoo-AOL would lack the unique data, such as user interests and tastes, that powers its rivals in online ads, chiefly Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google and Facebook Inc (FB.O). Armstrong, who made his name leading sales at Google, is highly regarded in the advertising community - in contrast to Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, another former Google high-flyer, who has been struggling to revive Yahoo. Mayer would likely leave after a Verizon-Yahoo deal, analysts said.  Verizon is not especially interested in Yahoo’s massive stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan Corp (4689.T), which are worth far more than its core internet business, the sources said.  That could leave an opening for a bidder such as Softbank Group (9984.T), Yahoo’s partner in Yahoo Japan, which might be able to devise a way to minimize the tax bill that would come with any sale of the Asia investments. “(Yahoo) is ultimately Verizon’s to lose,” said Robert Peck, Internet analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. “They’re the leading candidate in this effort and can afford to pay the most because of cost synergies and scale.” Other players weighing joint or solo bids are media company Time Inc TIME.N and several private equity firms including Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) and KKR & Co LP (KKR.N), according to sources. The owner of Britain’s Daily Mail newspaper also said this week it is in talks with potential partners to mount a joint bid.

Tech companies including the former Hewlett Packard Co and  Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) have reorganized in the face of the PC industry decline. Many new tech users around the world turn to mobile phones for their computing needs, and corporations increasingly rely on big machines rather than desktop models to run their businesses. Global personal computer shipments fell 11.5 percent in the first quarter, tech research company IDC said on Monday. Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, lowered its revenue forecast for the year. It now expects revenue to rise in mid-single digits, down from its previous forecast of mid- to high-single digits. Intel’s shares were down 2.2 percent at $30.90 in extended trading. Most of Intel's factories are in the United States, although it did not identify where cuts would be focused geographically. It said it would record a pretax restructuring charge of $1.2 billion in the second quarter and expected annual savings of $1.4 billion per year starting mid-2017. (bit.ly/1WDPfBm) The company also said Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith will move to a new role leading sales, manufacturing and operations. Intel said it would begin a formal search process for a new CFO. Smith said that Intel now expects the PC market to decline by a percentage in the high single digits in 2016 versus a prior forecast of a mid single-digit decline. Declines in China and other emerging markets are also leading to greater than anticipated reductions in worldwide PC supply chain inventory, Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on a conference call. “PC demand, at least in the eyes of Intel, is expected to be weaker than the industry originally anticipated,” said Angelo Zino, an equity analyst at S&P; Capital Global Market Intelligence. He added that although the industry has already seen some of the weakness experienced by Intel, the company’s comments dashed any hope of recovery. The Santa Clara, California-based company has been focusing on its higher-margin data center business as it looks to reduce its dependence on the slowing PC market. Intel has also made inroads into the mobile devices market, although competitors Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) and Samsung Electronics Co(005930.KS) dominate there. Intel said in a statement the job cuts would be carried out by mid-2017 and the restructuring would “accelerate its evolution from a PC company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices.” Sales of products for the data center and the Internet of things accounted for 40 percent of revenue and the majority of operating profit, it added. Raymond James analyst Hans Mosesmann, who rates Intel “under perform” said the problems leading to the job cuts were likely more about Intel than the broader tech industry.  “The bigger issue is the restructuring and will it be enough for the company to properly adapt to a changing environment where cloud and IoT competitive dynamics are quite different,” Mosesmann added. On a per share basis, the company earned 42 cents per share, in the first quarter, up from 41 cents a year earlier. Net revenue rose to $13.70 billion from $12.78 billion. Non-GAAP net revenue came in at $13.80 billion, compared with analysts’ average estimate of $13.83 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

1036,INTC,"As Microsoft soars on cloud, PC partner Intel seeks lift off","SAN FRANCISCO, April 21 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp  and Intel Corp’s financial results this week brought into sharp relief the onetime PC partners’ attempts to gear up for cloud computing, where Microsoft is soaring and Intel has not quite taken off. Chipmaker Intel has seen its share price drop 2 percent over the last year, as software maker Microsoft’s stock has risen 30 percent. Microsoft’s market capitalization of around $439.68 billion is almost three times Intel’s at $150.96 billion, compared to about double five years ago. “Wintel” computers running Windows on Intel chips dominated the personal-computing era, which is slowly ending as more people turn to mobile phones for computing needs and corporations deemphasize desktops. Both Intel and Microsoft, run by relatively new CEOs Brian Krzanich and Satya Nadella, are betting their businesses on the cloud. Microsoft’s cloud business, a combination of services and software catering to corporations moving computing functions to remote data centers run by outside providers, is growing strongly, although analysts want more clarity. A category it calls “intelligent cloud,” which includes traditional server software, grew 3 percent over the last year to $9.46 billion. At Intel, in a quarter where the company announced plans to cut 12,000 jobs as it shifts away from the PC, data-center business revenue rose 9 percent to $4 billion. That segment includes the chips powering cloud data centers, where the company says it is doing well. “There’s this perception that Microsoft is more on the cusp and benefiting from this (cloud) trend,” said Dan Morgan, a fund manager at Synovus Trust Co who holds both companies in his portfolio. “Intel is still more drowned out,” meaning not as high-profile. Microsoft’s best-known play in the cloud is Azure, a set of services for computing and storage as well as tools for software developers. Azure is gaining ground on Amazon’s AWS unit, the industry heavyweight in cloud computing services. Azure commands about 10 percent of the $23 billion market, estimates Synergy Research, compared with AWS’s 31 percent. Intel has done well in its category, dominating the market for processor chips that are the brains of data center computers, but the business faces major pressures. Much of the difference in the companies’ fortunes boils down to Microsoft’s fundamental business as a software company versus Intel’s as a hardware company, argues Nick Sturiale, a venture capitalist at Ignition Partners. Clients are spending an ever-larger part of their technology budget on software, according to research firm Gartner. And Intel’s customer base for data-center chips is consolidating into a few big companies, including Facebook, Google, Amazon and Microsoft itself, from a much wider group. “The cloud vendors are brutal price negotiators and have more power over Intel,” said Sturiale. Average prices of data center chips fell 3 percent in the last quarter, although Intel said that reflected the fact that cheaper chips were gaining ground the fastest. Intel could suffer as big data-center builders like Facebook increasingly design their own data-center hardware. So far, Intel has held its own, but one day its customers could extend their cost-cutting to chips. In a call this week with analysts, Krzanich said Intel’s “top to bottom” understanding of the cloud-based data center and keen eye on competitors would help it stay ahead. “Always paranoid about the competition, always driving,” he said. “And you know that we live or die by the performance of our product.” Intel makes other promising products, including chips for Internet-connected devices known as the Internet of Things. If a blockbuster consumer or business product in that market comes along, those chips could take off. And Microsoft may be overemphasizing how far it has come.  Much of its “intelligent cloud” business comprises software for traditional on-premises servers and other businesses with little to do with the cloud. A spokeswoman said the segment’s name “is to align to the ambition” of  building the cloud. Microsoft also is good at playing up its cloud business. In its January earnings call with investors, the term “cloud” came up 59 times. In Intel’s call this week, it came up 11 times.

Clients are spending an ever-larger part of their technology budget on software, according to research firm Gartner. And Intel’s customer base for data-center chips is consolidating into a few big companies, including Facebook, Google, Amazon and Microsoft itself, from a much wider group.  “The cloud vendors are brutal price negotiators and have more power over Intel,” said Sturiale. Average prices of data center chips fell 3 percent in the last quarter, although Intel said that reflected the fact that cheaper chips were gaining ground the fastest. Intel could suffer as big data-center builders like Facebook increasingly design their own data-center hardware. So far, Intel has held its own, but one day its customers could extend their cost-cutting to chips. In a call this week with analysts, Krzanich said Intel’s “top to bottom” understanding of the cloud-based data center and keen eye on competitors would help it stay ahead.  “Always paranoid about the competition, always driving,” he said.  “And you know that we live or die by the performance of our product.”	  Intel makes other promising products, including chips for Internet-connected devices known as the Internet of Things. If a blockbuster consumer or business product in that market comes along, those chips could take off.   And Microsoft may be overemphasizing how far it has come.  Much of its “intelligent cloud” business comprises software for traditional on-premises servers and other businesses with little to do with the cloud. A spokeswoman said the segment’s name “is to align to the ambition” of  building the cloud. Microsoft also is good at playing up its cloud business. In its January earnings call with investors, the term “cloud” came up 59 times. In Intel’s call this week, it came up 11 times.

1040,INTC,UPDATE 6-Warren Buffett's Berkshire takes $1 bln bite of Apple,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) revealed a more than $1 billion stake in Apple Inc (AAPL.O) in a rare foray into the technology sector, which Buffett has largely shunned apart from a poorly performing investment in IBM (IBM.N).  Shares of Apple rose 3.7 percent on the news, closing up $3.36 at $93.88. Berkshire made its investment in the first quarter, before the iPhone maker in April reported its first quarterly revenue decline in 13 years. The investment was announced amid an increasing view among investors that Apple may deserve a lower valuation because its heady growth days may be over. However, Apple has a strong balance sheet and management, attributes long favored by Berkshire. “It makes sense because it’s a consumer company disguised as a technology company with a great business model, strong cash flow and a cheap valuation,” said Jeff Matthews, author of books about Buffett and a principal at the Ram Partners LP hedge fund. “It’s not a leap of faith.” In a regulatory filing detailing most of its stock holdings, Berkshire said it held 9.81 million Apple shares worth $1.07 billion as of March 31. The value of the stake has since fallen to about $921 million, even with Monday’s gain. Berkshire’s largest technology bet has been Buffett’s roughly $12.1 billion stake in International Business Machines Corp, an investment now more than $1.6 billion in the red.   Apple stock “is stunningly cheap, and it has a massive pile of cash,” said Steve Wallman, founder of Wallman Investment Counsel in Middleton, Wisconsin, who has owned shares of Berkshire since 1982 and Apple since 2003. “Apple is not getting credit for research and development it is doing behind the scenes.” An Apple spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment. The Apple investment was made by one of Buffett’s two stockpicking deputies, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, his assistant said in an email to The Wall Street Journal. Combs and Weschler, who ran hedge funds before joining Berkshire, each invest about $9 billion and usually make smaller wagers, while Buffett, known as the Oracle of Omaha, makes bigger investments such as IBM. Investors said Combs may have been the Apple buyer. He  invested in chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) for Berkshire in 2011. Buffett’s assistant did not respond to a request for comment. In April, Apple said revenue for the quarter ended March 26 declined as an increasingly saturated smartphone market hurt iPhone sales, which fell for the first time.  Chief Executive Tim Cook is looking to develop other technologies for the Cupertino, California-based company, and last week unveiled a $1 billion investment in Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing. Apple’s market value last week dipped below that of Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), even though Apple generates roughly triple the revenue and profit. Before Monday, shares of Apple were down by a third from their April 2015 peak. Synovus Trust Company portfolio manager Daniel Morgan, noting that Buffett is known as a value buyer, said; “That kind of puts the icing on the cake that Apple now is probably considered more of a mature technology company, like we would think of Microsoft, Intel or Cisco. “I don’t think we can put them in the same bracket right now as Google, Amazon (AMZN.O) or Netflix (NFLX.O),” said Morgan said, who owns Apple because of its low price-earnings ratio and high dividend yield. “It’s a value stock that has the potential for a big growth,” said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors in New York who also holds Apple stock. Hedge fund manager David Einhorn is also a fan, and his firm Greenlight Capital on Monday said it boosted its Apple stake by 31 percent in the first quarter. Other prominent investors have retrenched. Last month, billionaire Carl Icahn said he sold his Apple stake on concern about the company’s relationship with China. David Tepper’s Appaloosa LP sold its stake in the first quarter, while Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates and Chase Coleman’s Tiger Global Management slashed their stakes. Leon Cooperman’s Omega Advisors also shed its Apple stake, a person familiar with the matter said. Despite his traditional aversion to technology sector, Buffett told CNBC on Monday that he offered to help Dan Gilbert, the chairman of Quicken Loans and owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team, finance a bid for internet company Yahoo Inc YHOO.O. Reuters first reported Buffett’s involvement on Friday.  While Buffett told CNBC he would not be an equity partner, he could collect dividends or interest on the financing, and perhaps take an equity stake later. “Buffett has always restricted himself from investing in things he doesn’t know or understand, and staying within his circle of confidence,” said Richard Cook, co-founder of Cook & Bynum Capital Management LLC in Birmingham, Alabama, which invests 8 percent of the $350 million it manages in Berkshire. The Apple investment may have been made with proceeds from the sale of AT&T; Inc (T.N) stock, as Berkshire exited what had been a $1.6 billion stake. In Monday’s filing, Berkshire also reported higher stakes in IBM, Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N), Deere & Co (DE.N) and Visa Inc (V.N), and lower stakes in MasterCard Inc (MA.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N).

1045,INTC,Biotech Regeneron replaces Intel as sponsor of Science Talent Search,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Biotechnology company Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc on Thursday became the title sponsor of the most prestigious U.S. science competition for high school students, taking the baton from chipmaker Intel Corp. Regeneron pledged $100 million to support the Science Talent Search and related programs through 2026, and doubled awards for the top 300 scientists and their schools, to $2,000 each. Regeneron’s two top executives competed in the annual event during the 1970s and went on to build one of the world’s biggest biotech companies, with cutting-edge drugs for fighting macular degeneration, cancer and cholesterol. The fast-growing biotech company will take over as named sponsor from Intel, whose chips were helping build the personal computer industry in 1998 when it took over as sponsor from Westinghouse. That storied electronics and industrial giant had sponsored the talent search from 1942 to 1997. The competition, overseen by the nonprofit Society for Science & the Public, receives applications annually from more than 1,800 high school seniors, along with their original research in all areas of science, including mathematics.  The field is winnowed to 300 young scientists, among whom 40 become finalists for a competition in Washington, D.C. Regeneron Chief Executive Len Schleifer competed in the Westinghouse Science Talent Search in 1970 with a project on Euclidian geometry. Company research chief George Yancopoulos was a top winner in 1976 for research that involved cutting protozoans in half to see what factors enabled the tiny organisms to regenerate. The young scholars stuck to the regeneration theme when Schleifer started Regeneron in 1988, with Yancopoulos its founding scientist. The company focused on discovering nerve-growth proteins that could regenerate neurons. They hoped to find cures for Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease. Those lofty efforts failed, but the company kept the Regeneron name as it changed course and focused on other diseases. A teacher at Forest Hills High School, in Queens, New York, encouraged Schleifer to enter the Westinghouse competition and gave him inspiration that has lasted a lifetime. “It taught me the value of having a teacher who really cared and served as my mentor,” said Schleifer. He expressed concern that many fine young scientific minds have been lost over recent decades to more-glamorous fields like investment banking, but said the Regeneron Science Talent Search will hopefully keep many others on track. Intel in March said its sponsorship would be ending but provided no details. Company executives declined further comment on Wednesday, including whether the discontinued sponsorship was related to austerity moves as Intel moves forward with 12,000 planned job cuts globally.

Ahead of Britain’s referendum on June 23, a poll showed those in favor of Britain exiting the EU, or “Brexit,” were well ahead of those who favor remaining. The British pound fell against the dollar. “The inability of the S&P; to even hold key resistance tells you the market is not ready to break out to new record highs,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York. “The global economy is weak and it can’t handle any major shocks. If Brexit occurs, that’s a major shock.” The S&P; energy index was down 2.2 percent, leading sector losses. At 3:14 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average was down 165.18 points, or 0.92 percent, to 17,820.01, the S&P; 500  lost 25.36 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,090.12 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 77.64 points, or 1.57 percent, to 4,880.98. Investors around the world swapped equities for less risky assets such as U.S. Treasury bonds and the Japanese yen. Yields on government bonds fell globally, to record lows in some cases, while the S&P; financial index was down 1.5 percent. Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of DoubleLine Capital, said Friday investors are dropping risky assets because of falling global GDP expectations, fueled by China’s slowing growth and the intensifying U.S. presidential race. Some stock investors are betting on a return of the volatility that marked the first two months of the year. The bounce-back in commodity prices that fueled much of the 13.3-percent rally in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index since its February lows is leveling off.

After three days of gains, losses in the past two sessions have pushed the Nasdaq into the red for the week, while the S&P; 500 and the Dow are roughly flat. Oil prices fell 2.5 percent as traders booked profits after a rally earlier this week pushed prices to their highest in 2016, and as the dollar regained lost ground. Financial stocks came under pressure again as global issues, including uncertainty over interest rate hikes and the impending vote on Britain’s membership in the European Union, sent investors flocking to safe haven assets. The yield on government bonds fell globally, to record lows in some cases. Gold, another safe haven, hit a fresh three-week high. “The U.S. indexes are trailing what is happening overseas this morning. We’ve seen a decline in crude prices and strength in U.S. treasuries and that combination adds ups to a red day,” said Paul Springmeyer, investment management director at U.S. Bank Wealth Managing in Minneapolis. “There still remains quite a bit of uncertainty out there ... and returns will be fairly muted until those question marks are resolved.” At 12:49 a.m. ET (1649 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was down 100.67 points, or 0.56 percent, at 17,884.52. The S&P; 500 was down 16.78 points, or 0.79 percent, at 2,098.7. The index has not closed below 2,100, a key technical level, so far this week. The Nasdaq Composite was down 50.35 points, or 1.02 percent, at 4,908.27. The CBOE Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, jumped 11.5 percent, its steepest rise in two months. Nine of the 10 S&P; sectors were lower, with the energy index’s 1.1 percent fall. Financials are now down 3.1 percent for the year, with healthcare the only other index in the red year-to-date. The telecom services index, which comprises of five stocks, was the only gainer, led by Verizon’s 1.5 percent rise. Among the other of the few bright spots was Intel, which eked out a 0.2 percent gain. Intel reversed course after Bloomberg reported the chipmaker would replace Qualcomm as an Apple supplier for some iPhones. Qualcomm was down 1.9 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,323 to 620. On the Nasdaq, 2,111 issues fell and 598 advanced.

1058,INTC,"UPDATE 2-BMW to develop driverless car technology with Intel, Mobileye","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BMW (BMWG.DE) is teaming up with Intel (INTC.O) and Mobileye MBLY.N to develop new technology for the auto industry that could put self-driving cars on the road by around 2021. The alliance highlights a shift in the dynamics of research and development in the car industry, which until recently saw automakers largely dictating terms for suppliers to manufacture their proprietary technologies at specified volumes and prices.   Now carmakers are increasingly striking up partnerships with technology firms using open technology standards, seeking to harness their expertise in areas including machine learning and mapping as they race against Silicon Valley companies such as Google (GOOGL.O), Tesla (TSLA.O) and Apple (AAPL.O) to develop driverless vehicles.  “Highly autonomous cars and everything they connect to will require powerful and reliable electronic brains to make them smart enough to navigate traffic and avoid accidents,” Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on Friday at a joint news conference announcing the alliance. The three companies said their new platform would be made available to multiple carmakers and they expected vehicles with highly and fully-automated driving would be brought into mass production by 2021. It is too early to say which other carmakers would join the alliance, BMW Chief Executive Harald Krueger said at a news conference on the outskirts of Munich on Friday. Sophisticated cruise control systems already enable “hands off” driving as cameras and computers allow cars to automatically brake, steer and accelerate in traffic at low speeds. But drivers are required to stay in control.  Now BMW, Intel and Mobileye will develop cars with even higher levels of automation described as “eyes off,” “mind off,” and “driver off”. This requires much more computing power and software know-how, forcing traditional carmakers to collaborate more closely with technology specialists. Both industries see huge revenue opportunities in the market for autonomous vehicles, although it is unclear how many drivers will be prepared to relinquish control and how quickly laws will be put in place to allow fully autonomous vehicles on the roads. But creating common technology standards would help all manufacturers update their vehicles faster, Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said. “That will be critical for advancing the safety aspects of this.”  A common approach to standards will also make it easier for regulators to understand and approve the roadworthiness of a vehicle while still leaving enough scope for individual car manufacturers to customize their cars, Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua said. Beyond technological hurdles there are legal questions over who is responsible when a crash occurs. On Thursday, the driver of a Tesla Model S car, operating in Autopilot mode, was killed in a collision with a truck in the United States, prompting an investigation by federal highway safety regulators.  When asked about the crash, BMW CEO Harald Krueger said: “The accident is very sad .... We believe today the technologies are not ready for series production,” he added, explaining the alliance had not forecast that until 2021. “For the BMW group, safety comes first,” he said.  As part of the new alliance, Intel, the world’s largest computer chip maker which has been looking to expand into the automotive electronics market, will supply the microprocessors - or central processing units - to control an array of sensors. Auto camera and software maker Mobileye will supply its Road Experience Management (REM) technology and make its latest EyeQ5 chip available to be deployed on Intel computing platforms. The three companies said they would demonstrate their technology in a prototype in the near future.

1063,INTC,Intel's slowing data center growth overshadows strong profit,"(Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) on Wednesday reported slower revenue growth at its data center business, which makes semiconductors used in high-end servers, overshadowing a better-than-expected quarterly profit. Shares of the world’s largest chipmaker fell 3 percent in after-hours trading. Hurt by weak demand from enterprises, revenue at the highly-profitable unit rose 5 percent to $4 billion, but lagged the previous quarter’s 9 percent increase and remained below Intel’s annual target of low double-digit growth. “As we enter the second half, we expect the enterprise segment of the business to stabilize and the cloud segment growth rate to accelerate,” Intel’s finance chief Stacy Smith said on a call with analysts. Intel has been focusing on the unit and its operation that makes chips for Internet-connected devices, as it seeks to lower dependence on the slowing PC market that it once helped create.     Sales from the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker’s traditional PC business, which also includes chips for mobile phones and tablets, declined 3 percent to $7.3 billion in the second quarter ended July 2. In contrast, global PC shipments fell less than expected in the quarter, helped by strength in the United States, according to research firm IDC.    Intel reported a better-than-expected profit as its cost-cutting begin to pay off. In April it announced plans to slash 12,000 jobs, or 11 percent of its global workforce, of which it said about half was already complete. Intel’s forecast for $14.9 billion in current-quarter revenue topped the average analyst expectation of $14.63 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The broader macro context hasn’t changed.” The S&P; is up more than 6 percent for the year, while the Dow’s nine-day winning streak is its best run since March 2013.

1075,INTC,ASML shares fall on fears Intel could delay use of its newest tool,"AMSTERDAM, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Shares in Dutch semiconductor equipment supplier ASML Holding fell after remarks by an Intel official suggested the company may hold off on using ASML’s newest tools in commercial production. Analysts said the comments by Mark Bohr, Intel’s Director of Process Architecture and a familiar figure in the industry, were no cause for alarm, but shares fell 4.5 percent to 93.54 euros by 1130 GMT in Amsterdam on Wednesday. Intel holds a 15 percent stake in ASML and is a key customer for its lithography machines which use focused light beams to map out the circuitry of computer chips. Speaking at an event in San Francisco, Bohr said Intel would initially rely on older ASML tools at Intel’s 7 nm fabrication plants, switching only to ASML’s newest EUV tools when they are deemed ready. EUV stands for “extreme ultraviolet”-range light waves. ASML dominates the market for lithography machines, but it is counting on adoption of the EUV machines — which can cost up to 100 million euros ($113 million) each — to increase sales to a target of 10 billion euros by 2020. Bernstein analysts said Bohr’s comments did not appear to mark a major change. “Intel would never bet unequivocally on an unproven technology,” Stacy Ragson wrote in a note on Intel’s presentation. “Dr. Bohr’s comments, while perhaps a bit more direct than what might have been perceived before, should not have been surprising.” Bernstein rates ASML shares “Outperform”. ASML still expects EUV machines to enter production in 2018 and be running at full volume by 2019, company spokesman Lucas van Grinsven said. Analyst Jos Versteeg from Dutch private bank Theodoor Gilissen, said Wednesday’s share decline presented investors with a “nice purchasing moment.” “Even if EUV were delayed, that wouldn’t be bad for ASML’s results, given that many more (current generation) systems would have to be sold” to compensate, he said. ASML is on Gilissen’s  list of “Recommended” stocks.

1084,INTC,"UPDATE 2-Teva, Intel to develop wearable tech for Huntington's disease","(Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA) said on Thursday it was collaborating with Intel Corp (INTC.O) to develop a wearable technology platform to track the progression of disease in patients with Huntington’s, a fatal degenerative disorder. The inherited condition causes the progressive breakdown of nerve cells in the brain, resulting in a gradual decline in motor control, cognition and mental stability. There are no approved drugs to alter the course of Huntington’s, although there are medicines that help with symptoms. Patients typically succumb to the disease within 15‐25 years of diagnosis. Teva (TEVA.N), with Intel, will deploy the technology as part of an ongoing mid-stage Huntington’s study, the Israeli company said on Thursday. Patients will use a smartphone and wear a smartwatch equipped with sensing technology that will continuously measure functioning and movement. The data from the devices will then be wirelessly streamed to a cloud-based platform, developed by Intel, that will translate it, in near real-time, into scores to assess motor symptom severity. The line between pharmaceuticals and technology is blurring as companies join forces to tackle chronic diseases using high-tech devices that combine biology, software and hardware. Accurate monitoring using wearables is expected to dovetail with a drive to offer so-called value-based healthcare. The aim is to prove that medicines can keep large groups of patients healthy, thereby improving their appeal to cost-conscious insurers. That gives drugmakers a major incentive to offer services that go beyond routine drug prescriptions. Businesses such as Apple (AAPL.O), Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and Alphabet, are all trying to find health-related applications for a new wave of wearable products. Earlier this month, Sanofi (SASY.PA) and Verily, the life sciences unit of Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), announced a joint venture combining devices with services to improve diabetes care. In August, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Verily created a new company focused on fighting diseases by targeting electrical signals in the body, a novel field of medicine called bioelectronics. Verily is also working on development of a smart contact lens in partnership with Swiss drugmaker Novartis (NOVN.S) that has an embedded glucose sensor to help monitor diabetes. Sanofi (SASY.PA) also has a diabetes deal with Alphabet, while Biogen (BIIB.O) is working with the tech giant to study the progression of multiple sclerosis. Teva, last year, announced it would partner with IBM’s (IBM.N) Watson Health.

The world’s largest chipmaker’s shares were down 5.3 percent at $35.75 in after-hours trading on Tuesday. Intel said it expects fourth-quarter revenue of $15.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts on average were expecting $15.86 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “This is below the average seasonal increase for the fourth quarter as we expect the worldwide PC supply chain to reduce their inventory,” Executive Vice President Stacy Smith said on a conference call with analysts. Last month, Intel raised its third-quarter revenue forecast for the first time in more than two years, citing improving PC demand. The company’s decision to raise third-quarter forecast moved investors’ expectations to a higher level, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy said. Revenue from the data center business, which offers storage and cloud-based software services, rose 9.7 percent to $4.54 billion in the third quarter, from a year earlier. Revenue growth from this unit for the full year will likely be in the high single digits, Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on the call.

1100,INTC,GLOBAL MARKETS-U.S. oil rises after surprise inventory drop; stocks up,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude oil prices rose to a 15-month high on Wednesday after a surprise U.S. inventory drawdown, boosting energy shares. WTI crude CLc1 hit its highest since July 2015 after the Energy Information Administration said U.S. stockpiles fell by 5.2 million barrels in the week ended Friday, dashing analysts’ expectations for a build. Stocks in the financial sector were boosted by Morgan Stanley’s (MS.N) better-than-expected quarterly profit, which rounds out a string of solid results from the largest U.S. banks. “We’re up because the (earnings) numbers are so great, the forward guidance is great and the banks just knocked it out of the park,” said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York. Energy stocks were boosted by the higher oil prices and helped offset a near 6-percent decline in shares of Intel after a disappointing revenue forecast. “The severe weakness in energy prices really took a toll. We’ve had a few starts up only to see prices fall, but this time it seems different, the price holding for longer and investors are warming to the sector,” said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. “Better energy prices are seen as a statement that maybe the economy is a little bit stronger,” he said. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 40.68 points, or 0.22 percent, to 18,202.62, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 4.69 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,144.29 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 2.58 points, or 0.05 percent, to 5,246.41. The pan-European STOXX 600  index rose 0.3 percent, following a 1.5 percent rise in the previous session. MSCI’s gauge of stocks world wide .MIWD00000PUS rose 0.4 percent.

1101,INTC,"US STOCKS-Oil, earnings lift Wall St but Intel drags","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks notched a second straight day of gains on Wednesday, as climbing oil prices lifted the energy sector and earnings from Morgan Stanley provided a boost to financials. Brent crude settled up 1.9 percent and U.S. crude settled up 2.6 percent after touching a 15-month high following a government report that showed a sharp drop in domestic inventories for the sixth week in seven. The energy sector .SPNY rose 1.4 percent, its biggest gain in seven sessions. A 4.2-percent rise in Halliburton (HAL.N) also provided a boost after the world’s No.2 oilfield services provider posted third-quarter results. Morgan Stanley (MS.N) gained 1.9 percent after posting a better-than-expected quarterly profit to round out a string of solid results from big U.S. banks. The financial sector .SPSY has risen in three of the past four sessions for a 1.7 percent advance.  “We’re up because the (earnings) numbers are so great, the forward guidance is great and the banks just knocked it out of the park,” said Ken Polcari, Director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York. “In the end, this quarter of earnings will not be negative, they will be slightly positive after it is all said and done.”   A disappointing revenue forecast from Intel (INTC.O) capped the advance on Wall Street, however. The chipmaker tumbled 5.9 percent as the biggest drag on each of the three major indexes. The PHLX semiconductor index .SOX shed 0.45 percent. With 70 companies in the S&P; 500 having reported earnings through Wednesday morning, 80 percent have topped earnings’ expectations. Third quarter earnings are now expected to increase 0.5 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, which would be the first quarter of growth in five.     The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 40.68 points, or 0.22 percent, to 18,202.62, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 4.69 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,144.29 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 2.58 points, or 0.05 percent, to 5,246.41.

WTI crude hit its highest since July 2015 after the Energy Information Administration said U.S. stockpiles fell by 5.2 million barrels in the week ended Friday, dashing analysts’ expectations for a build. Stocks in the financial sector were boosted by Morgan Stanley’s better-than-expected quarterly profit, which rounds out a string of solid results from the largest U.S. banks. “We do expect better earnings and we are encouraged by good financial earnings recently with strong fixed income trading,” said Jeff Kravetz, regional investment director at the Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank in Phoenix, Arizona. “Overall it’s looking to shape up to be a pretty good earnings season.” Energy stocks were boosted by the higher oil prices and helped offset a near 6-percent decline in shares of Intel after a disappointing revenue forecast. “The severe weakness in energy prices really took a toll. We’ve had a few starts up only to see prices fall, but this time it seems different, the price holding for longer and investors are warming to the sector,” said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. “Better energy prices are seen as a statement that maybe the economy is a little bit stronger,” he said.

The energy sector jumped 2 percent, the most in three weeks, with a 5.2 percent rise in Halliburton also providing a boost after the world’s No.2 oilfield services provider posted third-quarter results. Morgan Stanley gained 1.8 percent after posting a better-than-expected quarterly profit to round out a string of solid results from big U.S. banks.

However, gains, especially on the Nasdaq, were limited by Intel. The chipmaker tumbled 6 percent, weighing the most on major indexes, after its disappointing revenue forecast. The chip index dipped 0.54 percent. U.S. crude prices surged 3 percent to a 15-month high after a report showed an unexpected drop in U.S. crude stockpiles. The energy sector jumped 1.74 percent, the most in three weeks, also boosted by a 4.8 percent rise in Halliburton  following its surprise quarterly profit.

Net profit reached 396 million euros ($434.65 million) for July-September from 322 million euros in the same period a year prior. The result compared with the 410 million euro average of 17 analyst estimates in a Reuters poll. However, sales of 1.82 billion euros beat analysts expectations of 1.72 billion euros on the back of higher sales of ASML’s newest machines. ASML forecast fourth-quarter revenue of 1.7 billion to 1.8 billion euros. Perhaps of greatest interest to company watchers, ASML reported three orders for the new machine, the NXE:3400 EUV system. CEO Peter Wennink said in a statement that six customers were “now actively engaged in the EUV introduction in both memory and logic.” As a result, the company booked 1.42 billion euros worth of new orders in the quarter, besting analyst estimates of 1.24 billion euros. ASML’s fortunes are seen as relying on how quickly the industry adopts the machines, which cost around 100 million euros apiece and are currently being tested by several of the world’s biggest chipmakers ahead of entering into scale production. A misunderstanding over remarks by Intel in August about its time-frame for adopting the EUV systems led to a selloff in ASML shares. ASML is dominant in its segment, lithography systems, which use focused rays of energy to help semiconductor makers lay out the circuitry of computer chips.

The French defence firm hiked its target for new orders after a long-awaited Indian fighter deal revived its hopes of boosting its order book this year. The world number-two retailer said sales growth accelerated in the third quarter, reflecting robust sales in Brazil and an improving performance in its core French market despite a difficult environment there. Europe’s top hotels group cut back the upper end of its 2016 profit target range on Tuesday after French and Belgian operations were hit by security fears in the third quarter. The world’s fifth-largest hotel group said these two countries remained a major point of vigilance for the group even though it achieved robust growth in most of its other key markets - including Britain, where the weak post-Brexit pound induced people to stay in the country for their holidays and attracted foreign visitors. The Dutch chip-making equipment manufacturer a supplier to Intel Corp and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, on Wednesday reported a 23 percent rise in third-quarter profit, missing analysts estimates. France’s nuclear watchdog on Tuesday told the state utility to conduct safety tests on five nuclear reactors before their scheduled maintenance period, adding potential further pressure to the country’s already tight supply situation. French forward power prices hit fresh highson Tuesday on persistent worries over further nuclear power reactor downtime in coming months at five plants, which could tighten European electricity supplies in winter. The Dutch coatings and paint maker reported third-quarter earnings and sales in line with market expectations. French bank BNP Paribas BNPP.PA is in exclusive talks to create a damage insurance joint venture with mutual insurer Matmut, Les Echos newspaper reported.

1110,INTC,EU court adviser backs Intel fight against record EU fine,"LUXEMBOURG/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Intel’s (INTC.O) fight against a record 1.06 billion euro  ($1.16 billion) EU antitrust fine received a boost on Thursday when a top Europe court adviser questioned whether the U.S. chipmaker’s actions had really harmed competition. The opinion from Advocate General Nils Wahl at the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) amounted to a rare setback for the European Commission, underlining the tough battle ahead as it takes on Apple (AAPL.O), Qualcomm (QCOM.O), Google (GOOGL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) in various competition cases. “Intel’s appeal against the imposition of a 1.06 billion euro fine for abuse of its dominant position should be upheld. The case should be referred back to the General Court for a fresh review,” Wahl said in a non-binding recommendation. He said the General Court failed to establish that the rebates and payments offered by Intel were anti-competitive and that certain deals between the firm and Lenovo harmed European consumers. These were key elements of the Commission’s 2009 decision. The General Court rejected Intel’s challenge two years ago, saying that the European Commission had not acted too harshly in handing down the record sanction amounting to 4.15 percent of Intel’s 2008 turnover against a possible maximum of 10 percent. The ECJ, which usually follows the adviser’s opinion in the majority of cases, is expected to rule in the coming months. The Commission declined to comment. Wahl’s opinion is a good sign for companies looking for guidance on what kind of rebates should be considered harmful, said Ian Giles, a partner at London-based Norton Rose Fulbright. “The extent to which the advocate general disagrees with the Commission is significant. The advocate general’s opinion says - on the Intel facts - the Commission got it wrong,” he said. “Assuming the court follows this opinion, this is a good outcome from the perspective of competition policy, and may lead to the Commission revising its approach in ongoing cases.” U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm is fighting EU charges of using anti-competitive methods, including giving rebates, to squeeze a rival. It will lay out its arguments at a hearing on Nov. 10. Intel’s fine remains the largest for a single company for an EU antitrust infringement.  The EU antitrust enforcer penalized Intel over what it called tactics aimed at stifling rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), including giving rebates to PC makers Dell [DI.UL], Hewlett-Packard Co (HPE.N), NEC (6701.T) and Lenovo (0992.HK) for buying most of their computer chips from Intel.($1 = 0.9115 euros) ",10202016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-intel-antitrust-court/eu-court-adviser-backs-intel-fight-against-record-eu-fine-idUSKCN12K0QN

It will lay out its arguments at a hearing on Nov. 10. Intel’s fine remains the largest for a single company for an EU antitrust infringement.  The EU antitrust enforcer penalized Intel over what it called tactics aimed at stifling rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), including giving rebates to PC makers Dell [DI.UL], Hewlett-Packard Co (HPE.N), NEC (6701.T) and Lenovo (0992.HK) for buying most of their computer chips from Intel.($1 = 0.9115 euros) ",10202016,http://www.reuters.com/article/eu-intel-antitrust-court/update-2-eu-court-adviser-backs-intel-fight-against-record-eu-fine-idUSL8N1CQ23V

1114,INTC,UPDATE 1-Samsung Elec to invest more than $1 bln in U.S. chip production,"SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) said on Tuesday it planned to invest more than $1 billion by the end of June 2017 to boost production of system chips at its Austin, Texas, facilities in the United States to meet growing demand.  The South Korean firm, the world’s second-largest chipmaker behind Intel Corp (INTC.O), said in a statement its investment would boost output of chips for mobile and other electronics devices from its existing facilities in the city.  The investment comes after Samsung said last week its capital expenditure for 2016 would rise to a record 27 trillion won ($24 billion), with 13.2 trillion won earmarked for its semiconductor business.  While most of Samsung’s semiconductor profits come from memory chip sales, it has been trying to boost earnings from other products including its own Exynos mobile processors and contract manufacturing deals with clients such as Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O).Samsung did not give further details for its investment plans in Austin, such as how much production capacity would be added.

1121,INTC,"Delphi, Mobileye to use Intel chip for self-driving car system","(Reuters) - Auto parts maker Delphi Automotive Plc and Israeli technology firm Mobileye NV will put an Intel Corp chip at the heart of their joint effort to produce self-driving vehicles by 2019, the companies said on Tuesday. The move is a boost for the world’s largest semiconductor maker, which is also working with German luxury car maker BMW AG and Mobileye on self-driving technology, but has not been able to extend its broader chip dominance into the fast-emerging autonomous vehicle market. Companies from Alphabet Inc’s Google to Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and Tesla Motors Inc are vying to put autonomous vehicles on U.S. roads, which could radically reshape transportation across the country.  Intel will provide a “system on chip” for autonomous vehicle systems that Delphi and Mobileye are developing together, Glen De Vos, Delphi’s vice president of engineering, told Reuters.  UK-based Delphi is talking with established automakers and new or niche vehicle companies, such as manufacturers of commercial vehicles, interested in automating vehicles, De Vos said.  The system Delphi and Mobileye are developing would likely come to market first in a commercial vehicle operating in a limited area, such as an airport shuttle or a ride-hailing service, DeVos said. Delphi is testing autonomous driving technology in vehicles in Singapore. By the end of this year, Delphi hopes to choose a city in the United States to launch a test fleet of self-driving cars during 2017, De Vos said. The company is also looking for test site in a European city. “We are looking at Pittsburgh and Boston and a couple of others,” De Vos said. Pittsburgh is where ride services company Uber is testing its own self-driving vehicles. Delphi and Mobileye will stage a demonstration of their self-driving vehicle system at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January, De Vos said. That system will use current, electromechanical laser imaging technology, or LIDAR, that is too expensive for use in consumer vehicles, he said. Delphi is also working with Quanergy Systems, a maker of solid-state LIDAR systems, De Vos said.

1122,INTC,Intel agencies at odds over Russian hacking,"Intel agencies disagree over Moscow's motive for hacking The overseers of the U.S. intelligence community have not embraced a CIA assessment that Russian cyber attacks were aimed at helping Republican President-elect Donald Trump win the 2016 election.Three American officials told Reuters that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) did not endorse the CIA analysis because of a lack of conclusive evidence that Moscow was trying to assist Trump at the expense of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Trump has called the CIA finding “ridiculous” - the latest in a string of disputes between the president-elect and the intelligence community he will soon command.  Exclusive: Bank hacking isn’t over yet Increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks targeting the global bank transfer system have succeeded in stealing additional funds since February’s heist of $81 million from the Bangladesh central bank. The attacks underscore the continuing vulnerability of the SWIFT messaging network, which handles trillions of dollars in fund transfers daily, report Tom Bergin and Jim Finkle.  ‘Trump is totally disruptive’ Donald Trump’s challenges to China on trade and Taiwan are rattling American companies who fear retaliation by Beijing if the incoming administration drops Washington’s long-standing position that Taiwan is part of “one China.” One source told Reuters that the business community had begun “quiet outreach” to Trump’s advisers, but was wary of discussing its concerns publicly for fear of becoming a target for the president-elect, who has singled out companies such as Carrier and Boeing.  Qatar to Trump: We’ll help rebuild U.S. roads The head of Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund has told U.S. officials it will invest $10 billion in infrastructure projects inside the United States, reports Tom Finn. The investment could help to cement ties with the Trump administration at a time of uncertainty in the Gulf, where Arab states fear any retreat of U.S. power could benefit regional foe Iran.

1123,INTC,Intel to take stake in German mapping firm HERE in automated driving push,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - U.S. chip maker Intel (INTC.O) will take a 15 percent stake in German digital mapping firm HERE, it said on Tuesday, as it seeks to build its presence in automated driving technology. A filing to the German cartel office on Tuesday showed Intel has sought approval to buy a stake in the company, which is controlled by German carmakers Daimler DAIGN.DE, BMW (BMWG.DE) and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE). Intel and HERE said in a statement that they had also signed an agreement to collaborate on the research and development of real-time updates of high definition (HD) maps for highly- and fully-automated driving.  Intel did not disclose how much it would pay for the stake but said the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter. The deal highlights a shift in the dynamics of research and development in the car industry, which until recently saw automakers largely dictating terms for suppliers to manufacture their proprietary technologies at specified volumes and prices. Now carmakers are increasingly striking partnerships with technology firms using open technology standards, seeking to harness their expertise in areas including machine learning and mapping as they race against Silicon Valley companies such as Google (GOOGL.O), Tesla (TSLA.O) and Apple (AAPL.O) to develop driverless vehicles. Last month two Chinese companies and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC agreed to buy a 10 percent stake in HERE and in July, BMW teamed up with Intel and Mobileye MBLY.N to develop self-driving cars by 2021. BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen bought HERE for 2.8 billion euros ($2.9 billion) in 2015 from mobile equipment maker Nokia NOK1V.HE of Finland. Last September, HERE said it would introduce a new set of traffic services allowing drivers to see for themselves what live road conditions are like miles ahead using data from competing automakers, an industry first.

1125,INTC,Apple files $1 billion lawsuit against chip supplier Qualcomm,"(Reuters) - Apple Inc filed a $1 billion lawsuit against supplier Qualcomm Inc on Friday, days after the U.S. government accused the chip maker of resorting to anticompetitive tactics to maintain a monopoly over key semiconductors in mobile phones. Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for “modem” chips that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40 percent of Qualcomm’s $23.5 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. In the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Apple said in its complaint that Qualcomm withheld the rebates because of Apple’s discussions with South Korea’s antitrust regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission. “If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm’s release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused,” Apple said in its lawsuit. In a statement, Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg called Apple’s claims “baseless.” “Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information,” Rosenberg said in the statement. “We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple’s practices and a robust examination of the merits.” Qualcomm’s stock closed 2.4 percent lower at $62.88 on the news. Qualcomm has patents for chips which include standard essential patents, a term used to describe technology that is required to be licensed broadly and on “reasonable” terms. In its lawsuit, Apple accused Qualcomm of refusing to license the technology to other manufacturers to prevent them from making the chips. It also accused Qualcomm of selling chips while requiring Apple to pay a separate licensing fee for the same chips, in a “no license, no chip” policy. In addition, Qualcomm pressured network carriers to not sell or support Apple devices made with Intel chipsets Apple said. The KFTC fined Qualcomm $854 million in December for what it called unfair patent licensing practices. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975 million fine in China, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. On Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm, saying the San Diego-based company used its dominant position as a supplier of certain phone chips to impose “onerous” supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers. Qualcomm said it would contest the FTC complaint. Qualcomm was the sole supplier of modem chips for Apple’s phones until the release of the iPhone 7 in September.  Intel Corp supplied about half of the modem chips for the newest models, said Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research. Intel’s shares closed up 1 percent at $36.94 after the Qualcomm suit was announced. Apple made the move around the same time that Samsung, which had switched to using its own internal chips for its Galaxy S6 phones, returned to Qualcomm for the Galaxy S7. Qualcomm “has been able to manage through (the Apple contract loss) pretty well because they got back Samsung at the same time,” Rasgon said.

Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich told reporters about the investment while standing behind President Donald Trump. Trump told reporters Krzanich called him a few weeks ago to say he wanted to meet to make a big announcement. Krzanich said he made the announcement at the White House as a sign of support for the “tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward.” Trump, a Republican who took office on Jan. 20, promised during his campaign to push companies to keep or create jobs in the United States rather than sending them abroad.

The issue did not come up during the Oval Office meeting, said Reed Cordish, a White House official in charge of technology initiatives. The company said in a statement that the plant would be completed in three or four years. The chip factory was started in 2011 as a $5 billion project that was targeted to open in late 2013. Intel shelved its plans in 2014 when smartphones and tablets cut into demand for chips for personal computers. Krzanich said in an email to Intel employees that was posted on the company’s website that the factory would build chips for data centers and smart devices.

1148,INTC,U.S. tech sanctions will rattle China's firewall,"HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - China has been giving fair warning. Telecoms equipment maker ZTE has agreed to plead guilty for violating U.S. export controls. The charges could have been more severe and the $892 million fine is manageable for the $9 billion company. More powerful is the message: the new U.S. administration is prepared to take action against corporate giants to rein in troublesome nations. The plea caps a five-year probe into the Shenzhen-based group over its business dealings with Iran and North Korea. Following a 2012 Reuters report, U.S. agencies have been investigating ZTE for selling telecommunications equipment with American technology to countries under U.S. economic sanctions. One year ago, the Commerce Department briefly banned all stateside firms from selling to the Chinese company, which relies on U.S. suppliers like Qualcomm and Intel for up to 30 percent of its components. ZTE will now plead guilty to unlawful export - shipping goods to countries without proper licenses - as well as lying about it. And it will be placed on an embarrassingly tight leash. It will agree to a three-year probation period and a seven-year suspended “denial of export privileges”. That means if ZTE does not meet certain conditions over this period, or further violates U.S. export laws, regulators could remove the suspension and deal a potentially lethal blow to ZTE’s supply chain.  The financial hit is not so bad. On Wednesday, ZTE estimated a full-year net loss of 2.4 billion yuan ($342 million) for 2016 after taking into account the fines. But it is already forecasting nearly a 32 percent year-on-year jump in net profit for the three months to March. The company’s Hong Kong shares rose as much as 8 percent on the news of the fine and its earnings. Relief is justified because the outcome could have been worse: French bank BNP Paribas was slapped with a mega $8.9 billion fine in 2014 for breaching similar U.S. sanctions. Still, after North Korea’s recent provocations, including firing four ballistic missiles toward Japan this week, now is opportune time for the United States to remind distant neighbours just how far its reach can go.

1149,INTC,"UPDATE 5-China's ZTE pleads guilty, settles U.S. sanctions case for nearly $900 mln","NEW YORK/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp has agreed to plead guilty and pay nearly $900 million in a U.S. sanctions case, drawing a line under a damaging scandal that had threatened its cut off its supply chain. While the fine was larger than expected, ZTE, also a major smartphone maker, reported robust underlying earnings for 2016 and was upbeat in estimates for the first quarter. That and the resolution of the case helped its Hong Kong-listed shares surge 6 percent. A five-year investigation found ZTE conspired to evade U.S. embargoes by buying U.S. components, incorporating them into ZTE equipment and illegally shipping them to Iran. In addition, it was charged in connection with 283 shipments of telecommunications equipment to North Korea.  “ZTE Corporation not only violated export controls that keep sensitive American technology out of the hands of hostile regimes like Iran’s, they lied ... about their illegal acts,” U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. ZTE relies on U.S. suppliers for 25 percent to 30 percent of its components, many of which are key to its goods. It purchases about $2.6 billion worth of components a year from U.S. firms, according to a company spokesman. Qualcomm, Microsoft and Intel are among its suppliers. “ZTE acknowledges the mistakes it made, takes responsibility for them, and remains committed to positive change in the company,” ZTE Chief Executive Zhao Xianming said in a statement. The company agreed to a seven-year suspended denial of export privileges, which could be activated if there are further violations, as well as three years of probation, a compliance and ethics program, and a corporate monitor. It also agreed to an additional penalty of $300 million that will be suspended during the seven-year term on the condition the company complies with requirements in the agreement.  When asked about the ZTE case, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said relevant departments of the government would continue to pay attention as to whether Chinese firms were receiving fair treatment. “The Chinese government consistently opposes foreign governments putting unilateral sanctions on Chinese companies. At the same time, we have always asked our companies to operate legally abroad,” he told a news conference without elaborating. Tim O’Toole, a Washington D.C.-based lawyer with Miller & Chevalier specializing in sanction cases, said U.S. court documents suggest ZTE’s attempts to obstruct the investigation were the main reason for a penalty significantly higher than in similar cases. “What seems really important to U.S. regulators is whether a company or individual after the investigation starts is seen to continue to evade the sanctions and also obstruct the investigation,” he said. The investigation, spearheaded by the U.S. Department of Commerce, followed reports by Reuters in 2012 that ZTE had signed contracts to ship millions of dollars worth of hardware and software from some of the best-known U.S. technology companies to Iran’s largest telecoms carrier. Last year, the Commerce Department released internal documents showing senior ZTE executives instructing the company to carry out a project for dodging export controls in Iran, North Korea, Syria, Sudan and Cuba. ZTE has replaced executives allegedly involved, including naming a new president.    The company said on Wednesday it slid to a preliminary net loss of 2.36 billion yuan ($342 million) in 2016, its first loss in four years, due to the settlement.  But without the fine, it would have logged 3.8 billion yuan in profit, 18 percent higher than a year earlier. That was better than expected, as was a preliminary estimate for the first-quarter net profit rising between 21 and 31 percent, said Cindy Lam, an analyst with UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong. The settlement includes a $661 million penalty to Commerce; $430 million in combined criminal fines and forfeiture; and $101 million paid to the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The action marks OFAC’s largest-ever settlement with a non-financial entity.    The Commerce Department will recommend ZTE be removed from a  list of entities that U.S. firms cannot supply without a license if it lives up to its deal and a court approves its agreement with the Justice Department. First placed on the list in March 2016, it has continued to do business with U.S. suppliers under a temporary general license that has been extended several times, with the latest reprieve expiring March 29. The company’s guilty pleas, which must be approved by a judge, will take place in U.S. District Court in Texas.

1150,INTC,Intel's $15 billion purchase of Mobileye shakes up driverless car sector,"JERUSALEM/DETROIT (Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) agreed to buy Israeli autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye MBLY.N for $15.3 billion on Monday in a deal that could thrust the U.S. chipmaker into direct competition with rivals Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) and Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) to develop driverless systems for global automakers.  The pricey acquisition of Mobileye could propel the world’s largest computer chipmaker into the front ranks of automotive suppliers at a time when Intel has been reaching for market beyond its core computer semiconductor business. It also promises to escalate the arms race among the world’s carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous vehicle technology, and could fuel already-overheated valuations of self-driving start-ups. The stakes are enormous. Last year, Goldman Sachs projected the market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles would grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion in 2025 and $290 billion in 2035. Skeptics have questioned whether auto companies and suppliers will be able to deploy fully self-driving cars safely in the next four years, as several have promised. Investment analysts on Monday raised concerns about the potential synergies between Intel and Mobileye, as well as the acquisition’s price. Intel has not been a significant player in the sector, although it has invested in at least half a dozen start-up companies developing different components for self-driving systems, from robotics to sensors.  Mobileye brings a broad portfolio that includes cameras, sensor chips, in-car networking, roadway mapping, machine learning, cloud software and data fusion and management. “This is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities,” said Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets. “Mobileye’s technology is very critical... The price seems fair,” she added. Still, the industry newsletter Semiconductor Advisors on Monday wrote that Intel’s acquisition of Mobileye indicates a strategic move “very far outside its core business franchise.”  The price is about 21 times expected 2017 revenue, making it more than six times more expensive than the semiconductor industry’s three-year deal average, said B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis. He said the “very expensive transaction” improved Intel’s position in the automated driver assistance market, but left Nvidia the leader on the highest end. Intel is paying a premium of 60 times Mobileye’s earnings, about four times the premium that Qualcomm is paying to acquire the Netherlands’ NXP.  The $63.54-per-share cash deal represents a premium of about 33 percent to Mobileye’s closing price of $47 on Friday, but below its all-time high closing price of $64.14 in August 2015. Mobileye’s shares rose 28.2 percent to close at $60.62, while Intel’s shares were down 2.1 percent.  The market for self-driving technology is becoming crowded, including mapping company Here, as well as technology companies ranging from Alphabet Inc’s Waymo (GOOGL.O) to Chinese Internet giant Baidu Inc (BIDU.O). Shares of systems integrator Delphi Automotive PLC (DLPH.N), which has partnerships with Intel and Mobileye, rose 4.0 percent. Delphi said in a statement that it expected the deal would let it accelerate adoption of new technologies. Intel has a mixed record of capitalizing on technology outside computer chips. Last year it spun out its cyber security division, formerly known as McAfee, in a deal valuing it at $4.2 billion including debt, five years after having bought McAfee for $7.7 billion. Intel will give Mobileye unusual autonomy, integrating its own automated driving group with Mobileye’s operations under Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua, who will lead the unit from Israel. Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said the acquisition was akin to merging the “eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car.” Mobileye supplies integrated cameras, chips and software for driver-assist systems - the building blocks for self-driving cars - to more than two dozen vehicle manufacturers. In an interview in January, Shashua told Reuters: “If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player... The idea is to have a number of partners to share resources and data.” Mobileye was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public break-up last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating the vehicle using Tesla’s Autopilot system. Mobileye, founded in 1999, accounts for 70 percent of the global market for driver-assistance and anti-collision systems. It employs 660 people and had adjusted net income of $173.3 million last year. Shashua and two other senior Mobileye executives stand to do well by the deal: together they own nearly 7 percent of the company. Shmuel Harlap, Israel’s biggest car importer and one of Mobileye’s earliest investors, also holds a 7 percent stake. BATTLE FOR SELF-CONTROL Mobileye and Intel are already collaborating with German automaker BMW (BMWG.DE) on a project to put a fleet of around 40 self-driving test vehicles on the road in the second half of this year. At the same time, Mobileye has teamed up with Intel for its fifth-generation of chips that will be used in fully autonomous vehicles that are scheduled for delivery around 2021. Mobileye also has partnered with Delphi on a self-driving platform that is being shopped to smaller car companies that may not have the resources to develop their own systems. Last October, Qualcomm announced a $47 billion deal to acquire NXP, the largest automotive chip supplier, putting pressure on other chipmakers seeking to make inroads in the market, including Intel, Mobileye and Nvidia. The Qualcomm-NXP deal, which will create the industry’s largest portfolio of sensors, networking and other elements vital to autonomous driving, is expected to close later in 2017.

1151,INTC,Intel banking on Mobileye deal for a drive in the right direction,"(Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) has had a tough time squeezing value out of recent mega-deals, putting some pressure on the success of its proposed $15 billion acquisition of Israeli car-technology firm Mobileye NV MBLY.N. Self-driving cars are widely seen as the future of transportation and a growth area, but the Intel deal depends on more than technology as it looks to expand revenue in an increasingly competitive nascent sector.     The company’s largest-ever deal, the $16.7 billion acquisition of programmable chipmaker Altera, has so far failed to meet its objective of helping to offset the continued decline in Intel’s larger PC business.      Intel also spun out its cyber security division, formerly known as McAfee, last year in a deal valuing it at $4.2 billion including debt, about five years after having bought the anitvirus software maker for $7.7 billion.     “We can recall few cases where so much has been spent(habitually) to buy so little,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.     Rasgon, who rates the stock “underperform”, notes Intel has spent over $30 billion in the last few years, while only adding about $2 to $3 billion in revenue.

1152,INTC,Intel banking on Mobileye deal for a drive in the right direction,"March 13 (Reuters) - Intel Corp has had a tough time squeezing value out of recent mega-deals, putting some pressure on the success of its proposed $15 billion acquisition of Israeli car-technology firm Mobileye NV. Self-driving cars are widely seen as the future of transportation and a growth area, but the Intel deal depends on more than technology as it looks to expand revenue in an increasingly competitive nascent sector. The company’s largest-ever deal, the $16.7 billion acquisition of programmable chipmaker Altera, has so far failed to meet its objective of helping to offset the continued decline in Intel’s larger PC business. Intel also spun out its cyber security division, formerly known as McAfee, last year in a deal valuing it at $4.2 billion including debt, about five years after having bought the anitvirus software maker for $7.7 billion. “We can recall few cases where so much has been spent (habitually) to buy so little,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. Rasgon, who rates the stock “underperform”, notes Intel has spent over $30 billion in the last few years, while only adding about $2 to $3 billion in revenue. Perhaps learning from those missteps, Intel’s Mobileye deal is uniquely structured. The Santa Clara-based company’s Automated Driving Group (ADG) will combine with Mobileye and will be led by Mobileye Chief Executive Amnon Shashua.

1153,INTC,UPDATE 8-Intel's $15 bln purchase of Mobileye shakes up driverless car sector,"* Intel offers $63.54 per share in cash * Mobileye shares up 28.2 percent to $60.62   (Adds analysts’ comments, skepticism about self-driving cars) By Tova Cohen, Ari Rabinovitch and Paul Lienert JERUSALEM/DETROIT, March 13 (Reuters) - Intel Corp agreed to buy Israeli autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye for $15.3 billion on Monday in a deal that could thrust the U.S. chipmaker into direct competition with rivals Nvidia Corp and Qualcomm Inc to develop driverless systems for global automakers. The pricey acquisition of Mobileye could propel the world’s largest computer chipmaker into the front ranks of automotive suppliers at a time when Intel has been reaching for market beyond its core computer semiconductor business. It also promises to escalate the arms race among the world’s carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous vehicle technology, and could fuel already-overheated valuations of self-driving start-ups. The stakes are enormous. Last year, Goldman Sachs projected the market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles would grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion in 2025 and $290 billion in 2035. Skeptics have questioned whether auto companies and suppliers will be able to deploy fully self-driving cars safely in the next four years, as several have promised. Investment analysts on Monday raised concerns about the potential synergies between Intel and Mobileye, as well as the acquisition’s price. Intel has not been a significant player in the sector, although it has invested in at least half a dozen start-up companies developing different components for self-driving systems, from robotics to sensors. Mobileye brings a broad portfolio that includes cameras, sensor chips, in-car networking, roadway mapping, machine learning, cloud software and data fusion and management. “This is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities,” said Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets. “Mobileye’s technology is very critical... The price seems fair,” she added. Still, the industry newsletter Semiconductor Advisors on Monday wrote that Intel’s acquisition of Mobileye indicates a strategic move “very far outside its core business franchise.” The price is about 21 times expected 2017 revenue, making it more than six times more expensive than the semiconductor industry’s three-year deal average, said B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis. He said the “very expensive transaction” improved Intel’s position in the automated driver assistance market, but left Nvidia the leader on the highest end. Intel is paying a premium of 60 times Mobileye’s earnings, about four times the premium that Qualcomm is paying to acquire the Netherlands’ NXP. The $63.54-per-share cash deal represents a premium of about 33 percent to Mobileye’s closing price of $47 on Friday, but below its all-time high closing price of $64.14 in August 2015. Mobileye’s shares rose 28.2 percent to close at $60.62, while Intel’s shares were down 2.1 percent. The market for self-driving technology is becoming crowded, including mapping company Here, as well as technology companies ranging from Alphabet Inc’s Waymo to Chinese Internet giant Baidu Inc. Shares of systems integrator Delphi Automotive PLC, which has partnerships with Intel and Mobileye, rose 4.0 percent. Delphi said in a statement that it expected the deal would let it accelerate adoption of new technologies. Intel has a mixed record of capitalizing on technology outside computer chips. Last year it spun out its cyber security division, formerly known as McAfee, in a deal valuing it at $4.2 billion including debt, five years after having bought McAfee for $7.7 billion. Intel will give Mobileye unusual autonomy, integrating its own automated driving group with Mobileye’s operations under Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua, who will lead the unit from Israel. Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said the acquisition was akin to merging the “eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car.” Mobileye supplies integrated cameras, chips and software for driver-assist systems - the building blocks for self-driving cars - to more than two dozen vehicle manufacturers. In an interview in January, Shashua told Reuters: “If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player... The idea is to have a number of partners to share resources and data.” Mobileye was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public break-up last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating the vehicle using Tesla’s Autopilot system. Mobileye, founded in 1999, accounts for 70 percent of the global market for driver-assistance and anti-collision systems. It employs 660 people and had adjusted net income of $173.3 million last year. Shashua and two other senior Mobileye executives stand to do well by the deal: together they own nearly 7 percent of the company. Shmuel Harlap, Israel’s biggest car importer and one of Mobileye’s earliest investors, also holds a 7 percent stake. BATTLE FOR SELF-CONTROL Mobileye and Intel are already collaborating with German automaker BMW on a project to put a fleet of around 40 self-driving test vehicles on the road in the second half of this year. At the same time, Mobileye has teamed up with Intel for its fifth-generation of chips that will be used in fully autonomous vehicles that are scheduled for delivery around 2021. Mobileye also has partnered with Delphi on a self-driving platform that is being shopped to smaller car companies that may not have the resources to develop their own systems. Last October, Qualcomm announced a $47 billion deal to acquire NXP, the largest automotive chip supplier, putting pressure on other chipmakers seeking to make inroads in the market, including Intel, Mobileye and Nvidia. The Qualcomm-NXP deal, which will create the industry’s largest portfolio of sensors, networking and other elements vital to autonomous driving, is expected to close later in 2017.

The S&P; 500 traded in its tightest range of the year, in and out of slight losses, while the CBOE Volatility index was on track to close at its lowest in more than a week. Shares of Mobileye jumped nearly 30 percent to a high of $61.51 after chipmaker Intel agreed to buy the driverless technology maker for $15.3 billion. Mobileye closed up 28.2 percent at $60.62 and Intel fell 2.1 percent to $35.16. Investors looked ahead to the Fed’s two-day meeting that starts on Tuesday. Traders saw a 94 percent chance that the U.S. central bank will lift interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday. “Other than the Fed on Wednesday I don’t see anything going on to make any (investment) decisions on,” said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte, Vermont. “Intel buying Mobileye is the story of the day, moving into that market sector,” he said, adding they advised some clients to “fade in” into Intel stocks. “We think this is a very good support point,” said Mendelsohn. Nvidia rose 2.8 percent to $101.85 while Delphi Automotive added 4.0 percent to $80.20. Both are involved in developing technology for cars. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 21.5 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,881.48, the S&P; 500 gained 0.87 points, or 0.04 percent, to 2,373.47 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 14.06 points, or 0.24 percent, to 5,875.78. Citrix Systems jumped 6.8 percent to $84.93 after Bloomberg reported that the cloud-services company is working with advisers to seek potential suitors. Wynn Resorts gained 4.8 percent to $104.30 after Morgan Stanley reiterated its “buy” rating and said the company could gain a meaningful market share in Macau.

1158,INTC,Intel puts self-driving pedal to financial metal,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Intel has put the self-driving pedal to the financial metal. Buying Mobileye for $15.3 billion values the autonomous-car parts supplier at 30 times this year’s estimated revenue, according to Thomson Reuters data. Justifying such a racy price tag will take some doing. Mobileye specializes in helping cars see what’s around them. Intel makes high-performance chips and runs data centers. Combining the two should mean better design systems that are aware of their surroundings, crunch massive amounts of data and react on the fly.  Intel estimates the market for vehicle systems, data and services will be about $70 billion in 2030. While that’s an absurdly long time frame for a financial prediction, the eventual amount could easily be far higher. The fast-expanding ability of computers to make sense of the world by sight will probably create undreamed-of markets.   Combining the entrepreneurial Israeli outfit and the blue-chip Intel may be awkward. It has struggled to integrate acquisitions before. Having paid $7.7 billion for McAfee in 2010, for example, Intel sold a majority of the unit six years later in a deal valuing it at just $4.2 billion. Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich is, at least, leaving Mobileye’s Ziv Aviram in charge, parking the $167 billion chipmaker’s self-driving unit in its new acquisition’s garage.  The financial justification for the deal, though, is a stretch. The $175 million of expected cost cuts carry a present value of around $1 billion once taxed, discounted and capitalized. That’s a country mile from the roughly $4 billion premium Intel is paying. That leaves Krzanich and his shareholders relying on Mobileye’s stunning growth continuing. Revenue is speeding ahead at a 45 percent annual clip while its operating margin of around 35 percent in recent quarters could hit 60 percent in the coming years, according to the consensus estimate of sell-side analysts.  Intel will need to sustain these for five years before the deal starts earning close to Intel’s cost of capital. Meanwhile, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Google-parent Alphabet and a slew of other firms are gunning for the market. That leaves plenty of chances for spanners to end up in the gears.",3132017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-intel-mobileye-breakingviews/intel-puts-self-driving-pedal-to-financial-metal-idUSKBN16K29S

1161,INTC,UPDATE 1-Connected or mechanical? TAG Heuer tries to bridge gap with module watch,"BRUNNEN, Switzerland (Reuters) - Swiss watchmaker TAG Heuer, owned by LVMH (LVMH.PA), sought to appeal to tech geeks and traditionalists alike on Tuesday by launching a connected watch that lets wearers switch between a smart watch head and a traditional mechanical movement. Watch exports fell some 10 percent last year as sales of traditional Swiss timepieces slowed. But Jean-Claude Biver, head of LVMH’s watch business, said:  “We’re seeing a really spectacular rebound in mainland China, and this, thanks to tourism, is helping other markets as well.”  TAG Heuer’s connected watch looks traditional. But the round watch case, containing the module that displays the time and information from the applications installed, can be unfastened from the watch strap and replaced with a separately sold watch case which looks almost identical, but has a traditional dial instead of a screen and contains a traditional mechanical watch movement.  TAG Heuer is trying to overcome the apparent contradiction between Swiss mechanical watches — powered by gearworks invented centuries ago and designed to last decades — and the latest technology to win new customers. Biver, launching TAG Heuer’s second-generation connected watch in Brunnen, was echoing comments by Swatch Group (UHR.S) Chief Executive Nick Hayek in a newspaper interview. Biver said TAG Heuer aimed to sell 150,000 pieces in 2017 and would launch a smaller unisex version in October. Despite an investment of over 10 million Swiss francs ($10 million), the connected watch was profitable, he said, adding TAG Heuer had sold 56,000 pieces of the first-generation connected watch. Thanks to a technology transfer from partner Intel Corp (INTC.O), the watch can be assembled in Switzerland, thus qualifying for the traditionally coveted “Swiss Made” label. The basic TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 will cost $1,650 for a watch module based on Google’s (GOOGL.O) Android Wear 2.0, with a built-in GPS and NFC contactless payment chip. An extra $4,000 can buy a mechanical watch module and a more expensive version is also available.  Market research firm Strategy Analytics estimates that 21 million smartwatches were sold in 2016. During the fourth quarter, Apple Watch took 63 percent of the smartwatch market, or 5 million devices. Samsung was second with 10 percent, down from 16 percent in the year-ago quarter.

1162,INTC,Israel eyes tax cuts as Intel-Mobileye deal to boost coffers by $1 billion,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel’s government will receive about 4 billion shekels ($1.1 billion) after Intel’s (INTC.O) planned $15.3 billion purchase of self-driving car tech firm Mobileye MBLY.N, helping the government cut more taxes, Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon said on Tuesday. Kahlon said that the extra revenue was small compared with the total annual tax take of almost 300 billion shekels but that it would help the government cut other taxes. The funds from the Mobileye deal will come from capital gains taxes of as much as 30 percent that top shareholders will pay when they sell their stakes in the company. Kahlon said even without the Mobileye deal, the largest technology takeover in Israel’s history, he was planning tax cuts. “I am in favor of lowering taxes. I have lowered taxes in the past. It’s my policy,” Kahlon said on Army Radio. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he and Kahlon had agreed to formulate a plan to reduce taxes to further stimulate economic activity. The Bank of Israel opposes tax cuts, believing excess revenue should go towards debt reduction.  Opposition leader Isaac Herzog said funds from the Mobileye deal should be diverted to bolstering the public health system. Israel’s economy grew 4 percent in 2016 but growth is expected to slow to around 3.5 percent this year.  In January, Kahlon said he would consider more tax cuts this year if tax revenue kept exceeding expectations. He lowered corporate tax by one point to 24 percent at the start of 2017, and the rate will drop to 23 percent at the start of 2018. Income taxes were also reduced. Kahlon declined to detail what taxes would be lowered in the next round but local media said value-added tax would fall from the current 17 percent while corporate taxes would be cut again.

1166,INTC,Correction: Fitch Affirms Intel at 'A+/F1' on Mobileye Acquisition; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 15 (Fitch) This release corrects the rating in the title of the  release that went out earlier today. Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings for Intel Corporation (Intel), including  the Long- and Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) at 'A+/F1', on news that  the company will acquire computer vision for advanced driver-assistance systems  (ADAS) provider, Mobileye NV (Mobileye), for $14.7 billion in cash. The Rating  Outlook is Stable. Fitch's actions affect $25.3 billion of total debt. A full  list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. Fitch believes the acquisition combines Mobileye's strong chip-based camera  systems with Intel's data center, artificial intelligence (AI) and connectivity  capabilities to create end-to-end autonomous driving (AD) system solutions. This  should enable Intel to accelerate time to market and customer adoption of  vehicle systems and services in a crowded field of competitors aggressively  positioning themselves within a nascent ADAS market, which is expected to reach  $70 billion by 2030. Fitch views the transaction as Intel's latest step in a move toward markets for  the internet of things (IoT) and away from the company's legacy personal  computing business, which still represented 55% of consolidated revenue and 58%  of allocated operating income in 2016.  The deal also hedges against the  company's dominant data center share, which Fitch believes will be increasingly  difficult to defend over time, given expectations for customer demand for  competing suppliers and architectures. The transaction adds approximately $450  million of higher profit margin revenue (Fitch's forecast for 2017) to Intel's  IoT segment, which still should represents roughly 5% of consolidated net  revenue for the year.  Intel's acquisition of Mobileye is expensive - even by recent deal standards -  with a more than 70x Fitch estimated forward operating EBITDA. Intel expects  $150 million of cost synergies exiting 2019 from the consolidation of  administrative functions and consolidation of overlapping development. Despite  its strategic rationale, Fitch believes the acquisition is credit-neutral solely  because Intel is able to use available offshore cash. Otherwise, Intel would  need to fund the transaction almost entirely with increment borrowing, likely  resulting in total leverage (total debt to operating EBITDA) at or above Fitch's  sensitivity of 1.5x, versus a Fitch estimated 1.1x for 2016.  Intel announced it reached a definitive agreement to acquire Mobileye via a  tender for $63.54 per ordinary share in cash, representing an equity value of  approximately $15.3 billion and enterprise value of $14.7 billion. Intel will  use off-shore cash, which was $13.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2016, and free cash flow  (FCF) to fund the transaction. Intel expects the deal to close within nine  months, subject to certain regulatory approvals and closing conditions, as well  as a successful tender. KEY RATING DRIVERS Leading Market Positions: Fitch expects Intel's very strong market positions in  the data center and personal computers (PC) to provide significant revenue  scale, with data center market growing in the mid-single digits offsetting  mid-single-digit unit shipment declines in PCs.  Technology Leadership: Intel's technology leadership, driven by significant  cumulative investments in research and development (R&D;) and capital spending  will support growth and strong profitability through at least the intermediate  term.  Solid FCF & Financial Flexibility: Fitch expects Intel's annual FCF to remain  robust, despite significant investment intensity. Fitch estimates more than $3  billion annually through the forecast period, providing adequate capacity for  organic investments, although the majority of FCF is outside the U.S.  High Investment Intensity: Fitch expects R&D; and capital spending to continue to  represent 35% - 40% of net revenues, driven by the continuation of Moore's Law  and non-volatile memory (3D NAND and X-Point) technologies.  Customer Concentration: Fitch expects customer concentration will remain  significant, given consolidated PC market. Intel's largest PC customers  continued to represent approximately 40% of total sales in aggregate.  Nonetheless, fast-growing acquisitions such as Mobileye, declining PC unit  shipments and Intel's increasing sale mix of data center and IoT customers  should diversify Intel's sales mix over time. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Client Computing Group (CCG) revenue declines by low-single digits, driven by  mid-single-digit unit declines offset by price increases from new product  introductions and strengthening PC mix; --Data Center Group (DCG) grows by mid-single digits in 2017 and low single  digits thereafter with lift from data center spending offset by customer demand  for competing architecture and alternate suppliers; --IoT grows by the mid-teens through 2018 and accelerates thereafter from  increased use cases, including ADAS; --Non-volatile memory cycles through the forecast with low-single-digit-growth  in 2017, followed by double-digit growth in 2018 and negative high-single-digit  growth in 2019 and flat growth in 2020; --Low-single-digit growth for security and programmable through the forecast  period; --Step-down in operating EBITDA margins from increased price concession in DCG  and higher mix of lower margin non-automotive IoT, offset by growing automotive  and pricing discipline and richer mix for CCG; --Capital spending remains volatile but in the mid-teens through the forecast  period; --Intel closes Mobileye at the beginning of fiscal 2018 growing 25% per year  with modestly accretive operating EBITDA margins; --$500 million of annual tuck-in acquisitions with no meaningful impact on  financial results; --Intel refinances debt maturities and uses domestic cash left after dividends  and acquisitions for share repurchases. RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative rating actions for Intel could result from: --Fitch's expectation for total leverage sustained above 1.5x from debt-financed  shareholder returns amid weak operating performance, given a meaningful portion  of pre-dividend FCF is outside the U.S.;  --Expectation for negative organic revenue growth from share losses in DCG and  slower than anticipated IoT adoption compounding negative growth in PCs; --Fitch's expectation for normalized FCF-to-adjusted debt sustained below 10%,  as a result of market pricing pressures from strengthened competitive offerings  in DCG. Positive rating action is unlikely in the intermediate term but likely would  require Fitch's expectations for: --Management's commitment to moderate shareholder returns to maintain total  leverage at or below 1x;  --Intel maintains significant share leadership and strong profitability in data  center, despite intensifying competition from alternative architectures. --Significant disruption from Intel's X-point technology and steady and solid  growth in IoT markets, resulting in further diversification of Intel's sales mix  and profit pools. LIQUIDITY Fitch believes Intel's liquidity was solid as of Dec. 31, 2016 and supported by  $17.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and trading  assets, $13.6 billion of which was located outside the U.S. Fitch's expectation  for more than $3 billion of annual FCF also supports the rating with a  meaningful portion of pre-dividend FCF generated outside the U.S. The company  does not have a revolving credit facility to support its up to $5 billion CP  program but Fitch views Intel's strong liquidity as providing ample support for  the program. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Intel Corporation --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A+';  --Short-Term IDR 'F1';  --$5 billion CP program 'F1';  --Senior unsecured notes 'A+';  --Junior subordinated notes 'A'. Altera Corporation --Long-Term IDR 'A+'; --Senior Unsecured Debt 'A+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

1167,INTC,Bosch sticks to own technology in face of Intel-Mobileye merger,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Bosch [ROBG.UL], the world’s biggest maker of automotive components, will continue to develop its own visual technology regardless of Intel’s $15 billion deal to buy Mobileye, an executive said on Wednesday. Germany’s Bosch competes with Israel’s Mobileye, which supplies integrated cameras, chips and software for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that are essential for autonomous driving, and owns about 70 percent of the market. “We are investing a lot of money in our own video technology and we want to stick with this strategy,” Bosch managing board member Dirk Hoheisel, who is in charge of mobility services, told a news conference at the Bosch Connected World exhibition. The acquisition of Mobileye by Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, promises to escalate the arms race among carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous vehicle technology. The deal was announced on Monday. Bosch Chief Executive Volkmar Denner said it was too early to say what effect the merger would have on the competitive landscape or Bosch’s own strategy. “I can only comment about the two companies as of today. Intel is a major chip supplier and therefore also partner of Bosch. Mobileye today is clearly a competitor,” he said. “What the future merger will bring, we will have to see. We will talk of course to Intel and Mobileye.” Bosch, along with rivals including Autoliv and Continental, have decided to stick to plans to develop their own technology for the current generation of ADAS, unlike for example Valeo, which stopped in-house development and decided to buy Mobileye’s products instead. Bosch also relies on an array of partnerships with software makers including SAP, Software AG, IBM, General Electric and Amazon. The co-founder of Mobileye as well as the chief executive of chipmaker Nvidia, with whom Bosch has a partnership in on-board computers, are also due to speak at the Bosch exhibition in Berlin. Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang is expected to give more details on Thursday of the partnership with Bosch, in which they will develop artificial intelligence to guide self-driving cars through complex traffic situations. The computers will be designed to learn how to use knowledge about the vehicle’s surroundings gathered with the help of cameras and sensors to make intelligent decisions about how to act, for example to avoid a pedestrian crossing the road. The on-board systems to enable fully automated driving are planned to come onto the market from 2020.  “Of course, we still have to prove that an autonomous car does better in driving and has less accidents than a human being... so it’s a promise,” Denner told the news conference.

1169,INTC,Fitch Affirms Intel at 'A-/F1' on Mobileye Acquisition; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings for Intel  Corporation (Intel), including the Long- and Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings  (IDR) at 'A+/F1', on news that the company will acquire computer vision for  advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) provider, Mobileye NV (Mobileye), for  $14.7 billion in cash. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch's actions affect  $25.3 billion of total debt. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of  this release. Fitch believes the acquisition combines Mobileye's strong chip-based camera  systems with Intel's data center, artificial intelligence (AI) and connectivity  capabilities to create end-to-end autonomous driving (AD) system solutions. This  should enable Intel to accelerate time to market and customer adoption of  vehicle systems and services in a crowded field of competitors aggressively  positioning themselves within a nascent ADAS market, which is expected to reach  $70 billion by 2030. Fitch views the transaction as Intel's latest step in a move toward markets for  the internet of things (IoT) and away from the company's legacy personal  computing business, which still represented 55% of consolidated revenue and 58%  of allocated operating income in 2016.  The deal also hedges against the  company's dominant data center share, which Fitch believes will be increasingly  difficult to defend over time, given expectations for customer demand for  competing suppliers and architectures. The transaction adds approximately $450  million of higher profit margin revenue (Fitch's forecast for 2017) to Intel's  IoT segment, which still should represents roughly 5% of consolidated net  revenue for the year.  Intel's acquisition of Mobileye is expensive - even by recent deal standards -  with a more than 70x Fitch estimated forward operating EBITDA. Intel expects  $150 million of cost synergies exiting 2019 from the consolidation of  administrative functions and consolidation of overlapping development. Despite  its strategic rationale, Fitch believes the acquisition is credit-neutral solely  because Intel is able to use available offshore cash. Otherwise, Intel would  need to fund the transaction almost entirely with increment borrowing, likely  resulting in total leverage (total debt to operating EBITDA) at or above Fitch's  sensitivity of 1.5x, versus a Fitch estimated 1.1x for 2016.  Intel announced it reached a definitive agreement to acquire Mobileye via a  tender for $63.54 per ordinary share in cash, representing an equity value of  approximately $15.3 billion and enterprise value of $14.7 billion. Intel will  use off-shore cash, which was $13.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2016, and free cash flow  (FCF) to fund the transaction. Intel expects the deal to close within nine  months, subject to certain regulatory approvals and closing conditions, as well  as a successful tender. KEY RATING DRIVERS Leading Market Positions: Fitch expects Intel's very strong market positions in  the data center and personal computers (PC) to provide significant revenue  scale, with data center market growing in the mid-single digits offsetting  mid-single-digit unit shipment declines in PCs.  Technology Leadership: Intel's technology leadership, driven by significant  cumulative investments in research and development (R&D;) and capital spending  will support growth and strong profitability through at least the intermediate  term.  Solid FCF & Financial Flexibility: Fitch expects Intel's annual FCF to remain  robust, despite significant investment intensity. Fitch estimates more than $3  billion annually through the forecast period, providing adequate capacity for  organic investments, although the majority of FCF is outside the U.S.  High Investment Intensity: Fitch expects R&D; and capital spending to continue to  represent 35% - 40% of net revenues, driven by the continuation of Moore's Law  and non-volatile memory (3D NAND and X-Point) technologies.  Customer Concentration: Fitch expects customer concentration will remain  significant, given consolidated PC market. Intel's largest PC customers  continued to represent approximately 40% of total sales in aggregate.  Nonetheless, fast-growing acquisitions such as Mobileye, declining PC unit  shipments and Intel's increasing sale mix of data center and IoT customers  should diversify Intel's sales mix over time. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Client Computing Group (CCG) revenue declines by low-single digits, driven by  mid-single-digit unit declines offset by price increases from new product  introductions and strengthening PC mix; --Data Center Group (DCG) grows by mid-single digits in 2017 and low single  digits thereafter with lift from data center spending offset by customer demand  for competing architecture and alternate suppliers; --IoT grows by the mid-teens through 2018 and accelerates thereafter from  increased use cases, including ADAS; --Non-volatile memory cycles through the forecast with low-single-digit-growth  in 2017, followed by double-digit growth in 2018 and negative high-single-digit  growth in 2019 and flat growth in 2020; --Low-single-digit growth for security and programmable through the forecast  period; --Step-down in operating EBITDA margins from increased price concession in DCG  and higher mix of lower margin non-automotive IoT, offset by growing automotive  and pricing discipline and richer mix for CCG; --Capital spending remains volatile but in the mid-teens through the forecast  period; --Intel closes Mobileye at the beginning of fiscal 2018 growing 25% per year  with modestly accretive operating EBITDA margins; --$500 million of annual tuck-in acquisitions with no meaningful impact on  financial results; --Intel refinances debt maturities and uses domestic cash left after dividends  and acquisitions for share repurchases. RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative rating actions for Intel could result from: --Fitch's expectation for total leverage sustained above 1.5x from debt-financed  shareholder returns amid weak operating performance, given a meaningful portion  of pre-dividend FCF is outside the U.S.;  --Expectation for negative organic revenue growth from share losses in DCG and  slower than anticipated IoT adoption compounding negative growth in PCs; --Fitch's expectation for normalized FCF-to-adjusted debt sustained below 10%,  as a result of market pricing pressures from strengthened competitive offerings  in DCG. Positive rating action is unlikely in the intermediate term but likely would  require Fitch's expectations for: --Management's commitment to moderate shareholder returns to maintain total  leverage at or below 1x;  --Intel maintains significant share leadership and strong profitability in data  center, despite intensifying competition from alternative architectures. --Significant disruption from Intel's X-point technology and steady and solid  growth in IoT markets, resulting in further diversification of Intel's sales mix  and profit pools. LIQUIDITY Fitch believes Intel's liquidity was solid as of Dec. 31, 2016 and supported by  $17.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and trading  assets, $13.6 billion of which was located outside the U.S. Fitch's expectation  for more than $3 billion of annual FCF also supports the rating with a  meaningful portion of pre-dividend FCF generated outside the U.S. The company  does not have a revolving credit facility to support its up to $5 billion CP  program but Fitch views Intel's strong liquidity as providing ample support for  the program.

The manner of Fitch’s  factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains  will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the  requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is  offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of  relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its  advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as  audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports,  engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties,  the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources  with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the  issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch’s ratings and reports  should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any  third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on  in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete.  Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the  information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and  other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the  work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial  statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings  and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking  and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature  cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current  facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that  were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.  The information in this report is provided “as is” without any representation or  warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or  any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the  report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security.  This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and  methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore,  ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual,  or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report. The  rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk,  unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or  sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals  identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible  for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes  only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute  for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer  and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be  changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch.  Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a  recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the  adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular  investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to  any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other  obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from  US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In  certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular  issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a  single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000  (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or  dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to  use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed  under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act  of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular  jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and  distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to  three days earlier than to print subscribers.

That data, says Intel Corp Chief Executive Brian Krzanich, is the key to the deal, and may see its first tangible revenue stream through mapping technology. Self-driving car data could bring in $450-$750 billion globally by 2030, according to McKinsey & Company, with such wide-reaching applications as shopping inside cars, vehicles as entertainment centers, or better city planning based on data. “Tech firms are hunting for ever more data. Miles = data,” wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas in a note on Monday to clients after Intel announced the deal.  To be sure, before self-driving cars dominate the road, unresolved debates over who owns the data, how it can be shared and whether drivers can opt out over privacy concerns need to be ironed out. It is also too early to gauge whether Mobileye will win a data race that has barely begun. Still, Mobileye says it has 80 percent of the market of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that can automatically apply brakes or keep a car in its lane, and Intel sees that as a start.  “That definitely helps fill the revenue opportunity for the next few years while the industry and carmakers move to full automation,” Kathy Winter, general manager of Intel’s automated driving unit, told Reuters. “When we look forward, everything we do together will be learning from the data coming off these vehicles.” Mobileye is working on its first commercial map application, Road Experience Management (REM), which feeds data about a vehicle’s surroundings into a system that updates existing maps in real time. Mobileye already has deals with BMW and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), which mean those carmakers’ vehicles can help source the data beginning in 2018, and share in the revenue. Intel already owns 15 percent of HERE, a digital map consortium made up of Germany’s automakers, which makes the high-definition maps that are updated by Mobileye’s REM. Given there are already 15 million cars with its cameras on the road, Mobileye has “significant early mover advantage” in the high definition mapping space, Jefferies analyst David Kelley wrote to investors last month. “This purchase validates that this data layer is valuable,” Stefan Heck, the CEO of Nauto, a Silicon Valley start-up also using a car vision system to collect and process data, told Reuters. Needham and Co, which sees a total ADAS market of $8.5 billion by 2022, surmised mapping data could be paid per mile by an autonomous car provider, while real-time data on traffic, hazards, or parking spots could be sold to mapping companies.

Tesla Inc, however, once a buyer of Mobileye’s camera system, has developed an in-house integrated vision-based system more reliant on radar than cameras, part of its push to be less reliant on suppliers.  Traditional suppliers like Germany’s Continental or Sweden’s AutoLiv, who have steered clear of the advanced navigation systems inside cars, may be too late to play “catch-up” to Intel, said Evercore’s Chris McNally in a note.

1175,INTC,UPDATE 1-China's ZTE Corp pleads guilty in U.S. court in sanctions case,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp (000063.SZ) (0763.HK) on Wednesday pleaded guilty in U.S. federal court in Texas for conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions by illegally shipping U.S. goods and technology to Iran. The guilty plea was part of an agreement the company reached earlier this month with U.S. authorities that also called for   nearly $900 million in fines and other penalties.  U.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade in Dallas accepted the company’s plea to three charges: conspiring to export American-made items to Iran without a license, obstructing justice, and making a material false statement. Shenzhen-based ZTE has a U.S. subsidiary in Richardson, Texas. A five-year investigation found ZTE conspired to evade U.S. embargoes by buying U.S. components, incorporating them into ZTE equipment and illegally shipping them to Iran. ZTE, which devised elaborate schemes to hide the illegal activity, agreed to the guilty plea after the U.S. Department of Commerce took actions that threatened to cut off the gear maker’s global supply chain. The investigation followed reports by Reuters in 2012 that ZTE had signed contracts to ship millions of dollars’ worth of hardware and software from some of the best-known U.S. technology companies to Iran’s largest telecoms carrier.  As part of the deal, ZTE will be under probation for three years and agreed to cooperate with authorities in any investigation of the company or third parties. The judge appointed a former Texas judge to monitor ZTE’s compliance. The company settled with the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Commerce Department in early March. In addition to $892 million it agreed to pay in fines and penalties, an additional penalty of $300 million could be imposed if it does not comply with its agreement with the Commerce Department over the next seven years. One of the world’s biggest telecommunications gear makers, ZTE purchases some $2.6 billion worth of components a year from U.S. firms, according to a company spokesman. Qualcomm (QCOM.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Intel (INTC.O) are among its suppliers. It also sells handset devices to U.S. mobile carriers AT&T; Inc (T.N), T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) and Sprint Corp (S.N).

1176,INTC,Mobileye deal to fuel investment in late-stage Israeli start-ups,"TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Intel’s $15.3 billion acquisition of Mobileye  has catapulted Israeli hi-tech into the global league, and is likely to stimulate investment in the sector’s other late-stage startups, where funds are most needed. Fundraising in late-stage startups - more mature firms that are already selling products rather than just the bright but unexploited ideas of entrepreneurs - has begun to increase. According to the Israel Venture Capital (IVC) Research Center, it rose to $2.9 billion in 2016 from $2.4 billion in 2015 as investors search for a higher yield on their investments. Venture capitalists believe the U.S. semiconductor giant’s purchase last week of Mobileye, which specializes in technology for driverless cars, should accelerate the trend. “A concern over the years has been that compared to the U.S., Israel cannot produce outsized returns,” said Adam Fisher, a partner who manages the Israel office for California-based venture capital fund Bessemer. “Mobileye is a perfect example of how a big business can be built in Israel and how a large corporate will not hesitate to pay a strategic premium for the business despite its location.” The price was about 21 times Mobileye’s expected 2017 revenue, or more than six times more expensive than the semiconductor industry’s three-year deal average. Until recently, many Israeli tech firms failed to grow enough to stay independent. Global companies, keen to tap into the skills of workers trained in the military and intelligence sectors, often bought them before they floated on the share market or when they were still small-cap stocks on the Nasdaq exchange. This was the case with Waze, the Israeli map app, which Google bought in 2013 for $1.15 billion. That same year, Wix, an Israeli startup which helps people build websites, made its market debut on New York’s Nasdaq, raising $127 million seven years after the company was founded.     Only a few, such as cyber security firm Check Point Software Technologies, which has a market valuation of almost $18 billion, have succeeded in remaining independent. Defense tech specialists such as Elbit Systems are largely off limits to foreign investors for Israeli national security reasons.     Michael Eisenberg, a partner at the Aleph VC, said the Mobileye sale signaled to late-stage financiers that they can expect much more significant returns on their investments. “It’s an accelerant and a belief that there is no glass ceiling for Israeli companies,” said Eisenberg, who also manages the portfolio of U.S. VC Benchmark in Israel. Autotalks, a provider of vehicle-to-vehicle communication for improving road safety, said on Wednesday it raised $30 million in late-stage funding from investors including Samsung’s Catalyst Fund, bringing to $70 million its total raised to date. Venture capitalists typically seek returns of 3-10 times their overall investment over time, with those investing at an early stage expecting a higher multiple than at the later stage.  Long known as the “startup nation”, Israel is maturing into  a “scale-up nation”, said Steven Schoenfeld, founder of BlueStar Indexes, which develops indexes and exchange traded-funds (ETF) that track Israeli stocks. However, Israelis are largely missing out on their own success as local institutions shy away from investing in technology companies, especially those listed abroad. Israeli institutions, which are typically conservative, tend to stick with indexes and benchmarks from the Tel Aviv exchange, he said.     Mobileye now accounts for 16 percent of BlueStar’s Israeli technology index. The ETF that tracks the index has gained 13.8 percent so far this year to an all-time high, while the Nasdaq is up 9.6 percent.     Schoenfeld pointed to software provider Amdocs and Wix as examples of other companies “going the distance” by staying independent for longer. Cyber security firm CyberArk, which is traded on Nasdaq, is another with strong growth potential.         Mobileye understood it could grow only so much on its own. The company has expanded rapidly in the two years since its New York share offering into mapping, systems building and intelligence of driving.  “All of these take time to build and time to get resources and Intel already has these resources,” said Mobileye co-founder Amnon Shasuha. “If we want to ... be the key player in autonomous driving, we need to think about it as an industry and not as a product.”     With more than 200 startups Israel is a growing center for automotive technology. Last year startups in the sector raised $681 million, nearly double the amount in 2015, according to the IVC.     Due to Mobileye, car manufacturers and their suppliers have been “making the pilgrimage” to Israel for the last several years and met with other startups, Fisher said.    The sector is already enjoying robust pricing for M&A; and the Mobileye deal will continue that, he said.     Potential acquirers “will more likely be the traditional tech companies that have a declared interest in the automotive sector rather than car companies themselves, but the latter wouldn’t surprise me either,” Fisher said.     Bessemer has invested in depth sensor technology company Oryx Vision as well as Otonomo, which developed a connected car data exchange, and Vayyar, a provider of 3D imaging sensors.     Argus Cyber Security, which has raised $30 million and collaborates with Qualcomm, is linking the automotive sector with another of Israel’s most vibrant sectors - cyber security - helping to prevent connected cars from being hacked.     The Mobileye deal, said Argus CEO Ofer Ben-Noon, could accelerate his company’s growth. “There is no doubt there will be more investments in Israel for automotive, and a lot more M&A;,” he said.    Car makers General Motors, Daimler, Volvo and Honda have all opened research and development centers in Israel.    Josh Kram, senior director for Middle East Affairs at theU.S. Chamber of Commerce, noted that about 300 American companies have R&D; centers in Israel, including Intel.     “Now they are moving into the autonomous space and purchasing Mobileye has catapulted them to the next level,” he said. “It’s a win-win for both companies.”  ",3222017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tech-israel/mobileye-deal-to-fuel-investment-in-late-stage-israeli-start-ups-idUSKBN16T29E

1178,INTC,UPDATE 2-SEC charges two Israeli residents with Mobileye insider trading,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two Israeli residents have been charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with insider trading in Mobileye NV before the maker of sensors and cameras for driverless vehicles agreed to be acquired by Intel Corp for $15.3 billion. According to a complaint filed on Thursday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Ariel Darvasi and Amir Waldman made “remarkably timed” purchases of Mobileye shares and call options prior to the March 13 merger announcement. The SEC said the purchases resulted in about $427,000 of profit for Darvasi and $4.5 million for Waldman, after the announcement caused shares of Jerusalem-based Mobileye to rise 28.2 percent in one day. According to the SEC, both defendants were connected to Mobileye insiders through the scientific academic community at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which developed Mobileye technology and produced at least 11 Mobileye directors and officers. Darvasi, of Mevasseret Zion, Israel, is a genetics professor at the university, while Waldman, of Yarqona, Israel, is a self-employed engineer, the SEC said. It was unclear whether Darvasi and Waldman have hired lawyers. Darvasi did not immediately respond to an email request for comment after normal business hours in Israel. Waldman could not immediately be reached for comment. Neither Mobileye nor Santa Clara, California-based Intel was accused of wrongdoing. Mobileye did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Intel declined to comment. Reuters obtained a filed copy of the complaint, which was not immediately available in online court records. U.S. District Judge Richard Berman in Manhattan on Thursday temporarily froze the defendants’ assets in two accounts at Interactive Brokers LLC, finding “a basis to infer” they violated U.S. insider trading laws, court records show. The SEC said Waldman conducted most of his Mobileye trading in the six weeks before the merger was announced, starting on the day Intel and Mobileye signed a non-disclosure agreement, and generated a 1,883 percent return. Darvasi began buying Mobileye stock on March 2 after selling 40,000 shares of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, the only securities in his account, the SEC said. The case is SEC v Darvasi et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-02088.

1179,INTC,China's ZTE Corp pleads guilty in U.S. court in sanctions case,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp  on Wednesday pleaded guilty in U.S. federal court in Texas for conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions by illegally shipping U.S. goods and technology to Iran. The guilty plea was part of an agreement the company reached earlier this month with U.S. authorities that also called for   nearly $900 million in fines and other penalties. U.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade in Dallas accepted the company’s plea to three charges: conspiring to export American-made items to Iran without a license, obstructing justice, and making a material false statement. Shenzhen-based ZTE has a U.S. subsidiary in Richardson, Texas. A five-year investigation found ZTE conspired to evade U.S. embargoes by buying U.S. components, incorporating them into ZTE equipment and illegally shipping them to Iran. ZTE, which devised elaborate schemes to hide the illegal activity, agreed to the guilty plea after the U.S. Department of Commerce took actions that threatened to cut off the gear maker’s global supply chain. The investigation followed reports by Reuters in 2012 that ZTE had signed contracts to ship millions of dollars’ worth of hardware and software from some of the best-known U.S. technology companies to Iran’s largest telecoms carrier. As part of the deal, ZTE will be under probation for three years and agreed to cooperate with authorities in any investigation of the company or third parties. The judge appointed a former Texas judge to monitor ZTE’s compliance. The company settled with the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Commerce Department in early March. In addition to $892 million it agreed to pay in fines and penalties, an additional penalty of $300 million could be imposed if it does not comply with its agreement with the Commerce Department over the next seven years. One of the world’s biggest telecommunications gear makers, ZTE purchases some $2.6 billion worth of components a year from U.S. firms, according to a company spokesman. Qualcomm, Microsoft and Intel are among its suppliers. It also sells handset devices to U.S. mobile carriers AT&T; Inc, T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp.",3232017,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-china-zte/chinas-zte-corp-pleads-guilty-in-u-s-court-in-sanctions-case-idUSL2N1H01ZO

1184,INTC,RPT-Mobileye deal to fuel investment in late-stage Israeli start-ups,"(Repeats Wednesday item) * Israeli start-ups raised nearly $5 billion in 2016, up 11 pct * Auto start-ups raised $681 mln in 2016, nearly doubled from 2015 * GM, Daimler, Volvo, Honda have opened R&D; centres in Israel * GRAPHIC: Israeli hi-tech raising tmsnrt.rs/2n3GCTY By Tova Cohen and Steven Scheer TEL AVIV, March 22 (Reuters) - Intel’s $15.3 billion acquisition of Mobileye  has catapulted Israeli hi-tech into the global league, and is likely to stimulate investment in the sector’s other late-stage startups, where funds are most needed. Fundraising in late-stage startups - more mature firms that are already selling products rather than just the bright but unexploited ideas of entrepreneurs - has begun to increase. According to the Israel Venture Capital (IVC) Research Center, it rose to $2.9 billion in 2016 from $2.4 billion in 2015 as investors search for a higher yield on their investments. Venture capitalists believe the U.S. semiconductor giant’s purchase last week of Mobileye, which specialises in technology for driverless cars, should accelerate the trend. “A concern over the years has been that compared to the U.S., Israel cannot produce outsized returns,” said Adam Fisher, a partner who manages the Israel office for California-based venture capital fund Bessemer. “Mobileye is a perfect example of how a big business can be built in Israel and how a large corporate will not hesitate to pay a strategic premium for the business despite its location.” The price was about 21 times Mobileye’s expected 2017 revenue, or more than six times more expensive than the semiconductor industry’s three-year deal average. Until recently, many Israeli tech firms failed to grow enough to stay independent. Global companies, keen to tap into the skills of workers trained in the military and intelligence sectors, often bought them before they floated on the share market or when they were still small-cap stocks on the Nasdaq exchange. This was the case with Waze, the Israeli map app, which Google bought in 2013 for $1.15 billion. That same year, Wix , an Israeli startup which helps people build websites, made its market debut on New York’s Nasdaq, raising $127 million seven years after the company was founded. Only a few, such as cyber security firm Check Point Software Technologies, which has a market valuation of almost $18 billion, have succeeded in remaining independent. Defence tech specialists such as Elbit Systems are largely off limits to foreign investors for Israeli national security reasons. Michael Eisenberg, a partner at the Aleph VC, said the Mobileye sale signalled to late-stage financiers that they can expect much more significant returns on their investments. “It’s an accelerant and a belief that there is no glass ceiling for Israeli companies,” said Eisenberg, who also manages the portfolio of U.S. VC Benchmark in Israel. Autotalks, a provider of vehicle-to-vehicle communication for improving road safety, said on Wednesday it raised $30 million in late-stage funding from investors including Samsung’s Catalyst Fund, bringing to $70 million its total raised to date. Venture capitalists typically seek returns of 3-10 times their overall investment over time, with those investing at an early stage expecting a higher multiple than at the later stage. Long known as the “startup nation”, Israel is maturing into  a “scale-up nation”, said Steven Schoenfeld, founder of BlueStar Indexes, which develops indexes and exchange traded-funds (ETF) that track Israeli stocks. However, Israelis are largely missing out on their own success as local institutions shy away from investing in technology companies, especially those listed abroad. Israeli institutions, which are typically conservative, tend to stick with indexes and benchmarks from the Tel Aviv exchange, he said. Mobileye now accounts for 16 percent of BlueStar’s Israeli technology index. The ETF that tracks the index has gained 13.8 percent so far this year to an all-time high, while the Nasdaq is up 9.6 percent. Schoenfeld pointed to software provider Amdocs and Wix as examples of other companies “going the distance” by staying independent for longer. Cyber security firm CyberArk, which is traded on Nasdaq, is another with strong growth potential. Mobileye understood it could grow only so much on its own. The company has expanded rapidly in the two years since its New York share offering into mapping, systems building and intelligence of driving. “All of these take time to build and time to get resources and Intel already has these resources,” said Mobileye co-founder Amnon Shasuha. “If we want to ... be the key player in autonomous driving, we need to think about it as an industry and not as a product.” With more than 200 startups Israel is a growing centre for automotive technology. Last year startups in the sector raised $681 million, nearly double the amount in 2015, according to the IVC. Due to Mobileye, car manufacturers and their suppliers have been “making the pilgrimage” to Israel for the last several years and met with other startups, Fisher said. The sector is already enjoying robust pricing for M&A; and the Mobileye deal will continue that, he said. Potential acquirers “will more likely be the traditional tech companies that have a declared interest in the automotive sector rather than car companies themselves, but the latter wouldn’t surprise me either,” Fisher said. Bessemer has invested in depth sensor technology company Oryx Vision as well as Otonomo, which developed a connected car data exchange, and Vayyar, a provider of 3D imaging sensors. Argus Cyber Security, which has raised $30 million and collaborates with Qualcomm, is linking the automotive sector with another of Israel’s most vibrant sectors - cyber security - helping to prevent connected cars from being hacked. The Mobileye deal, said Argus CEO Ofer Ben-Noon, could accelerate his company’s growth. “There is no doubt there will be more investments in Israel for automotive, and a lot more M&A;,” he said. Car makers General Motors, Daimler, Volvo  and Honda have all opened research and development centres in Israel. Josh Kram, senior director for Middle East Affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, noted that about 300 American companies have R&D; centres in Israel, including Intel. “Now they are moving into the autonomous space and purchasing Mobileye has catapulted them to the next level,” he said. “It’s a win-win for both companies.” ",3232017,http://www.reuters.com/article/tech-israel/rpt-mobileye-deal-to-fuel-investment-in-late-stage-israeli-start-ups-idUSL5N1GZ5CB

1186,INTC,"After sale to Intel, Mobileye's founder raises sights on IPO for OrCam","JERUSALEM (Reuters) - With the ink barely dry on the $15 billion sale of his autonomous driving technology firm Mobileye MBLY.N to Intel (INTC.O), inventive Israeli entrepreneur Amnon Shashua now has his sights set on taking another start-up public by the end of next year. Roughly a decade after founding Mobileye, whose camera-based sensor chips and software systems are helping to develop self-driving cars, Shashua set up OrCam, which uses a camera mounted on eyeglass frames to help the visually impaired interact with their surroundings. OrCam’s system can read newspapers, street signs and recognize common items, dictating words into the user’s ear. The company completed a $41 million investment funding round last month that values the company at $600 million. “Sales targets for 2017 are four times more than 2016,” Shashua told Reuters. “By the end of 2018 the revenue, the profit, of the company will be at such a level, together with the ability to forecast, that it’s good enough for an IPO.” The listing would either be on Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange, he said. The company would not provide further financial details. The Intel-Mobileye deal, announced on March 13, is expected to close within nine months and will result in Intel’s Automated Driving Group being integrated into Mobileye and based in Israel, with Shashua, Mobileye’s chairman and chief technology officer heading up the combined group. Though most of his time will be focused on Mobileye, Shashua doesn’t see that detracting from his efforts to prepare OrCam for a listing, although commentators have questioned how easy it will be able to divide up his time. “I’m going to get more responsibilities as folding in Intel’s assets in autonomous driving and leading the combined effort, but I believe that this is not going to change anything in terms of the time I spend at OrCam,” he said.

News of the transaction caused shares of Mobileye to rise 28.2 percent in one day.  The SEC filed civil charges against Cluff and Shaoul nearly two weeks after charging two Israeli residents, Ariel Darvasi and Amir Waldman, with insider trading in Mobileye, and generating more than $4.9 million of gains. It was unclear whether Cluff and Shaoul have hired lawyers. Cluff did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Shaoul could not immediately be reached for comment. Reuters obtained a filed copy of the complaint, which was not immediately available in online court records. According to the SEC, Cluff’s and Shaoul’s “highly suspicious” trading occurred after the adult children of two Mobileye founders told Shaoul’s adult children, with whom they were friends, about Intel’s interest in Mobileye. The SEC also said both defendants, like Darvasi and Waldman, were connected to Mobileye through the academic community at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which developed Mobileye technology and where Shaoul, an Israeli citizen, had studied. According to the complaint, the suspicious trading occurred in two accounts held in Cluff’s name, including one that had been dormant for six years and one opened on Jan. 29, 2017, around the time formal merger talks began.

1194,INTC,"Chinese automakers SAIC, Geely turn up heat on global rivals","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Global automakers face fresh threats to their profits in China from domestic automakers SAIC and Geely, which are launching new models and marketing strategies to challenge better-known foreign brands in the world’s largest car market. The country’s biggest automaker, Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp (SAIC), wants to double sales of its fully owned domestic brands this year - albeit from a low base - executives told a group of reporters on Monday. “China success is the base of overseas market success,” said Zhang Liang, product portfolio planning director for SAIC Motor’s passenger vehicles operation. Zhang said SAIC’s MG and Roewe - brands based on technology acquired from bankrupt British car maker MG Rover - plan a total of five car models and nine sport utility vehicles, and would aim to offer quality comparable to global brands such as Nissan, but at a lower price. A concept shown to reporters for an MG sports coupe it will exhibit at this week’s Shanghai auto show could pass for a Jaguar. “I worry for them,” Zhang said of the global brands. “You see local technology getting stronger and stronger.”  SAIC, controlled by Shanghai’s municipal government, has toiled for years in the shadow of its foreign partners, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and General Motors Co (GM.N), who are obliged by Beijing to form joint ventures with a local automaker for their China operations.  Those two joint ventures accounted for about 16.5 percent of the Chinese passenger car market last year, compared with just 1.3 percent share for SAIC’s own brands. However, those 50-50 alliances with GM and VW have generated floods of cash that SAIC has ploughed into hiring European designers to give its future MG vehicles more flair. It has spent 2.25 billion yuan ($327 million) on new research and engineering facilities in Shanghai, where company engineers are working with the same suppliers as their foreign rivals to improve the safety, quality and reliability of MG and Roewe models.  In one lab, Roewe and MG vehicles are shaken on machines that simulate rough roads. In another lab, cars are frozen, then subjected to broiling simulated desert heat, while engineers evaluate the performance of engines and climate control systems. With the help of suppliers such as Mobileye NV, an Israeli autonomous vehicle firm Intel (INTC.O) is buying for $15 billion, SAIC plans to offer advanced safety systems such as automatic emergency braking, as established rivals do. Rival Zhejiang Geely Holding Group [GEELY.UL], through its ownership of Swedish luxury automaker Volvo Cars, is pursuing a similar strategy of marrying European styling and developed market safety and quality engineering to Chinese production costs, primarily through its new Lynk & Co brand, company executives told Reuters.  Geely on Sunday evening staged an elaborate party at Shanghai’s West Bund Art Center to debut the production version of its forthcoming sport utility vehicle and a prototype for its “03” model, a sedan to go with a planned sporty coupe.  Geely president An Conghui told Reuters in an interview that Lynk & Co would allow Geely to compete head-on with global automakers both in China and overseas. Lynk & Co has said it plans to sell vehicles in the United States and Europe after launching in China. Geely brand models currently are priced up to about 150,000 yuan ($22,000). Lynk & Co cars should sell for up to 250,000 yuan - in the heart of the mainstream segment that accounts for about 45 percent of Chinese passenger vehicle sales and that is now dominated by foreign brands such as Volkswagen, GM, Ford Motor Co (F.N), Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and Honda Motor Co Ltd (7267.T).

1195,INTC,"Chinese automakers SAIC, Geely turn up heat on global rivals","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Global automakers face fresh threats to their profits in China from domestic automakers SAIC and Geely, which are launching new models and marketing strategies to challenge better-known foreign brands in the world’s largest car market. The country’s biggest automaker, Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp (SAIC), wants to double sales of its fully owned domestic brands this year - albeit from a low base - executives told a group of reporters on Monday. “China success is the base of overseas market success,” said Zhang Liang, product portfolio planning director for SAIC Motor’s passenger vehicles operation. Zhang said SAIC’s MG and Roewe - brands based on technology acquired from bankrupt British car maker MG Rover - plan a total of five car models and nine sport utility vehicles, and would aim to offer quality comparable to global brands such as Nissan, but at a lower price. A concept shown to reporters for an MG sports coupe it will exhibit at this week’s Shanghai auto show could pass for a Jaguar. “I worry for them,” Zhang said of the global brands. “You see local technology getting stronger and stronger.”  SAIC, controlled by Shanghai’s municipal government, has toiled for years in the shadow of its foreign partners, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and General Motors Co (GM.N), who are obliged by Beijing to form joint ventures with a local automaker for their China operations.  Those two joint ventures accounted for about 16.5 percent of the Chinese passenger car market last year, compared with just 1.3 percent share for SAIC’s own brands. However, those 50-50 alliances with GM and VW have generated floods of cash that SAIC has ploughed into hiring European designers to give its future MG vehicles more flair. It has spent 2.25 billion yuan ($327 million) on new research and engineering facilities in Shanghai, where company engineers are working with the same suppliers as their foreign rivals to improve the safety, quality and reliability of MG and Roewe models.  In one lab, Roewe and MG vehicles are shaken on machines that simulate rough roads. In another lab, cars are frozen, then subjected to broiling simulated desert heat, while engineers evaluate the performance of engines and climate control systems. With the help of suppliers such as Mobileye NV, an Israeli autonomous vehicle firm Intel (INTC.O) is buying for $15 billion, SAIC plans to offer advanced safety systems such as automatic emergency braking, as established rivals do. Rival Zhejiang Geely Holding Group [GEELY.UL], through its ownership of Swedish luxury automaker Volvo Cars, is pursuing a similar strategy of marrying European styling and developed market safety and quality engineering to Chinese production costs, primarily through its new Lynk & Co brand, company executives told Reuters.  Geely on Sunday evening staged an elaborate party at Shanghai’s West Bund Art Center to debut the production version of its forthcoming sport utility vehicle and a prototype for its “03” model, a sedan to go with a planned sporty coupe.  Geely president An Conghui told Reuters in an interview that Lynk & Co would allow Geely to compete head-on with global automakers both in China and overseas. Lynk & Co has said it plans to sell vehicles in the United States and Europe after launching in China. Geely brand models currently are priced up to about 150,000 yuan ($22,000).

1197,INTC,Intel's revenue misses estimates as data center growth slows,"(Reuters) - Intel Corp reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue due to an unexpected slowdown in growth at its data center business, on which the world’s largest chipmaker is banking to reduce its reliance on the personal computer market. The company’s shares fell nearly 4 percent to $35.97 in trading after the bell on Thursday. Revenue from Intel’s higher-margin data center business rose 6 percent to $4.2 billion in the first quarter. That was less than the 9 percent jump a year-ago and the 8 percent increase in the fourth quarter. “I think the Street was looking for slightly better than that,” Stifel analyst Kevin Cassidy said. Analysts were expecting revenue to increase 10 percent to about $4.4 billion, according to FactSet StreetAccount. The slowdown in revenue growth comes after Intel warned in February that business’s margins could be hit by higher costs. However, Intel still expects the business to grow in the high single-digit percentage rate this year, Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on a call. Intel marginally raised its full-year revenue forecast, which Krzanich said was due to average selling prices across its businesses trending ahead of expectations. The Santa Clara-based company expects 2017 revenue of about $60 billion. It had earlier forecast revenue would be flat compared with 2016 revenue of $59.4 billion. Intel increased its share buyback program by $10 billion to about $15 billion and also raised its 2017 adjusted profit forecast by 5 cents to $2.85 per share, plus or minus 5 percent. The company has previously said it expects its deal to buy autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye NV, announced last month, to boost adjusted profit. The acquisition thrusts Intel into the forefront of the market to develop driverless systems. The deal, along with a focus on cloud computing, will also help Intel reduce its dependence on the PC market. Intel gets most of its revenue from selling chips used in PCs. Its PC business returned to growth in 2016 as demand stabilized in the second half of the year. Demand also unexpectedly edged up in the first quarter, according to research firm IDC. That helped revenue from the client computing group, as Intel calls the business, increase 6 percent to $8 billion, matching estimates. Intel’s total revenue rose 8 percent to $14.80 billion, falling short of analysts’ estimate of $14.81 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income jumped 45 percent to $2.96 billion.

Intel agreed to buy Mobileye for $15.3 billion in March in a deal which, if completed, is expected to result in a capital gains tax payment of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. Israel had initially believed the money would fund tax cuts, but the central bank was worried converting such a large sum from dollars would further strengthen the shekel, which Bank of Israel officials have said is “over-valued”.

In a joint statement, Delphi and Transdev said they will test driverless vehicles in Normandy and outside Paris, in advance of building a commercial service, starting in 2019, that could be deployed in other markets, including North America. It would be the first such commercial application on public roads of fully automated vehicles, they said. The Delphi-Transdev partnership will provide “a clear path to commercializing automated mobility on demand,” said Glen De Vos, Delphi’s chief technology officer, in a media briefing. Delphi is contributing a self-driving system that it has been developing with Israeli mapping and vision expert Mobileye NV MBLY.N, which is being acquired by U.S. chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O). Transdev will manage the project and will provide ticketing, dispatch, routing and remote control-command services, the companies’ statement said. French automaker Renault SA (RENA.PA) will supply the venture with Zoe electric minicars, according to Yann Leriche, Transdev’s chief performance officer.    The test phase will start later this year with two Zoe minicars in Rouen in Normandy and a shuttle bus in the Paris suburb of Saclay, Leriche told the media briefing.    Initially, the vehicles will have “safety” drivers on board, but the plan is to move quickly next year to tests of fully driverless vehicles that are remotely controlled and monitored by human operators, he added.    Delphi has been building its expertise and capability in self-driving vehicles through partnerships, investments and acquisitions.  Several of its affiliates will participate in the project with Transdev, including Ottomatika (vehicle control software), Control-Tec (real-time data analytics) and Movimento (over-the-air software updates). Transdev, a mobility services provider, operates public and private transport services in 19 countries.  The company is controlled by Caisse des Depots, an investment arm of the French government. Veolia Environnement SA (VIE.PA), the French waste management company, holds a 30-percent stake. The Delphi-Transdev partnership is the latest in a growing web of global alliances aimed at putting self-driving vehicles on the road over the next four years.

12,INTC,Fitch Rates Intel's $600MM 7-Year Senior Notes Offering 'A+',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 14 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+' rating to Intel Corporation's (Intel) $600 million seven-year senior notes offering. Intel will use net proceeds for general corporate purposes, ahead of the company's pending acquisition of Mobileye N.V. (Mobileye). Intel just received U.S. regulatory approval for the acquisition and Fitch believes the transaction should close before the end of calendar year 2017. Pro forma for: i) the issuance, ii) $6.5 billion of senior notes issuance in May 2017, iii) repayment of $500 million of senior notes in May 2017 and iv) expected repayment of $3 billion of senior notes maturing Dec. 15, 2017, Fitch estimates total debt is just over $29 billion. A full list of current ratings follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Leading Market Positions: Fitch expects Intel's very strong market positions in the data center and personal computers (PC) to provide significant revenue scale, with data center market growing in the mid-single digits offsetting mid-single-digit unit shipment declines in PCs. Technology Leadership: Intel's technology leadership, driven by significant cumulative investments in research and development (R&D;) and capital spending will support growth and strong profitability through at least the intermediate term. Solid FCF & Financial Flexibility: Fitch expects Intel's annual FCF to remain robust, despite significant investment activity. Fitch estimates more than $3.5 billion annually through the forecast period with upside should Intel maintain operating EBITDA margins in the mid-40% range, versus the low-40% range in 2016. Nevertheless, cash flow will provide adequate capacity for organic investments, although the majority of FCF is outside the U.S. High Investment Intensity: Fitch expects R&D; and capital spending to continue to represent 35%-40% of net revenues, driven by the continuation of Moore's Law and non-volatile memory (3D NAND and X-Point) technologies. At the same time, Intel has committed to limiting operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to 30% by 2020, versus 35.6% on a GAAP basis in 2016. Customer Concentration: Fitch expects customer concentration will remain significant, given the consolidated PC market. Intel's largest PC customers continued to represent approximately 40% of total sales in aggregate. Nonetheless, fast-growing acquisitions such as Mobileye, declining PC unit shipments, and Intel's increasing sale mix of data center and IoT customers should diversify Intel's sales mix over time. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Flat Client Computing Group (CCG) revenue, driven by mid-single-digit unit declines offset by price increases from a strengthening PC mix and new product introductions; --Data Center Group (DCG) grows by mid-single digits in 2017 and low single digits thereafter with healthy spending from cloud and communications service providers offset by weaker enterprise spending; --IoT grows by high-single digits in 2017 and accelerates to the low-teens through the remainder of the forecast period; --Non-volatile memory remains uneven with solid growth for 2017 due to tight supply that should ease in 2018; --Low-single-digit growth for security and programmable through the forecast period; --Stable operating EBITDA margins due to a richer mix in CCG offset by lower operating income for DCG; --Operating EBITDA could exceed $27 billion for the year, resulting in total leverage (total debt/operating EBITDA) near 1x and FCF/debt of more than 15% exiting the year; --Capital spending remains volatile but in the mid-teens through the forecast period; --Intel closes Mobileye by the end of calendar 2017 and grows 25% per year with modestly accretive operating EBITDA margins; --$500 million of annual tuck-in acquisitions with no meaningful impact on financial results; --Intel refinances debt maturities and uses domestic cash left after dividends and acquisitions for share repurchases. RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative rating actions for Intel could result from the following: --Fitch's expectation for total leverage sustained above 1.5x from debt-financed shareholder returns amid weak operating performance, given that a meaningful portion of pre-dividend FCF is outside the U.S.; --Expectation for negative organic revenue growth from share losses in DCG and slower than anticipated IoT adoption compounding negative growth in PCs; --Fitch's expectation for normalized FCF/adjusted debt sustained below 10%, as a result of market pricing pressures from strengthened competitive offerings in DCG. Positive rating action is unlikely in the intermediate term but likely would require Fitch's expectations for the following: --Management's commitment to moderate shareholder returns to maintain total leverage at or below 1x; --Intel maintains significant share leadership and strong profitability in data center, despite intensifying competition from alternative architectures; --Significant disruption from Intel's X-point technology and steady and solid growth in IoT markets, resulting in further diversification of Intel's sales mix and profit pools. LIQUIDITY Liquidity was solid as of April 1, 2017 and consisted of: --$17.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and trading assets, of which $14.2 billion was outside the U.S. and $2.2 billion was available for use in the U.S. without incurring incremental tax liabilities. The company plans to use offshore cash to fund the $15.3 billion acquisition of Mobileye N.V. (Mobileye), which is scheduled to close before the end of calendar 2017; --An up to $5 billion commercial paper (CP) program, of which $431 million was outstanding. Intel does not have a revolving credit facility to support its CP program but Fitch views the company's cash flow profile as providing ample support for the program, particularly given Fitch's expectations for only moderate use. Fitch's expectations for more than $3 billion of annual FCF also support liquidity. FULL LIST OF CURRENT RATINGS Intel Corporation --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A+'; --Short-Term IDR 'F1'; --CP program 'F1'; --Senior unsecured notes 'A+'; --Junior subordinated notes 'A'. Altera Corporation --Long-Term IDR 'A+'; --Senior Unsecured Debt 'A+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch’s ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete.

14,INTC,"Continental joins BMW, Intel, Mobileye platform for self-driving cars","BERLIN (Reuters) - Continental (CONG.DE) said on Tuesday it would join a self-driving platform developed by BMW (BMWG.DE), Intel (INTC.O) and Mobileye MBLY.N with the German auto parts and tire maker handling integration of components and software. The costs to integrate hardware, software and data and the accelerating pace of development of self-driving vehicles has sparked a growing number of alliances between automakers and suppliers. Continental, the world’s second-biggest supplier to carmakers by sales, said it would play a key role in commercializing the new platform, which is to be sold to other auto manufacturers. “We can meet the steep demands in autonomous driving through an industry-wide collaboration more comprehensively, rapidly and at lower costs than by going alone,” Chief Executive Elmar Degenhart said in an emailed statement.    BMW already last year joined forces with U.S. chipmaker Intel and Mobileye, the Israeli vision system and mapping expert on the self-driving platform, which is targeted for production in 2021. U.S. parts maker Delphi Automotive (DLPH.N) has since joined the tie-up. In April, Germany’s Daimler (DAIGn.DE) formed a similar alliance with supplier Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL] to speed development of self-driving vehicles.

15,INTC,Intel signs Olympics sponsorship deal through 2024,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) said on Wednesday it would become a major sponsor of the International Olympic Committee, making the chipmaker the latest technology company to put marketing dollars behind the global sporting event. The new deal, which goes until 2024, comes a week after longtime Olympics sponsor McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) bowed out of its sponsorship deal three years early, citing a change in the company’s priorities as it tries to hold down costs. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed but IOC sources have previously told Reuters that major sponsors pay about $100 million per four-year cycle, which includes one summer and one winter games. The IOC has been looking to increase the cost of those deals, sources previously said. Intel joins about a dozen global Olympics sponsors such as Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), Samsung (005930.KS) and most recently, Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba (BABA.N) which signed on six months ago. The IOC has been trying to make the Olympics more technologically savvy and appeal to younger people through its internet-based TV network, the Olympic Channel. IOC President Thomas Bach and Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich said Intel’s sponsorship will open up new experiences for athletes, fans and spectators in emerging areas such as virtual reality. “We’ll allow people online to feel like they are there,” Krzanich said, speaking at a press conference in New York. Intel said it would provide 5G wireless technology, virtual reality, artificial intelligence platforms, and drones that could be used in aerial filming or light shows.  Intel’s business has undergone big changes in recent years. In March, it agreed to buy autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye MBLY.N for $15 billion in a bid to expand its reach beyond its core microprocessor business, which has faced declines along with the personal computer market. Intel may be seeking to expand its reach in Asia, which is preparing to host three consecutive Olympic Games. Pyeongchang in South Korea is staging the 2018 winter games, Tokyo the 2020 Summer Olympics and Beijing the 2022 Winter Olympics. The IOC is deciding between Paris and Los Angeles for the 2024 summer games. The IOC is looking to sign pricier deals while brands are trying to figure out whether exclusive Olympics sponsorship rights offer the marketing impact they once did. Some companies find it is much cheaper to work directly with athletes or specific countries than the IOC. Timo Lumme, managing director of IOC Television and Marketing Services, said in an interview that the IOC, with 13 top sponsors, has more partners than ever before, showing that brands see “tangible returns” from investing in the games. As for the tensions in the Korean Peninsula, Lumme said that the IOC is monitoring the situation daily to see if it could effect the 2018 games.  “We feel very sure and comfortable and that the Korean government will provide a safe environment for the world’s athletes to meet next February,” Lumme said.

(INTC.O) has joined Team8, an Israeli creator of cybersecurity start-ups, as a strategic partner and will help with the formation of companies that address the largest cybersecurity problems, Team8 said on Wednesday. Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, joins Team8’s syndicate members Microsoft (MSFT.O), Cisco (CSCO.O), Qualcomm (QCOM.O), AT&T; (T.N), Citigroup (C.N), Accenture (ACN.N), Nokia (NOKIA.HE), Bessemer Venture Partners and Eric Schmidt’s Innovation Endeavors. Israel has some 450 cyber start-ups, which receive 20 percent of global investment in the sector. Although the need for security is growing quickly, the proliferation of start-ups means that several companies compete in every subsector. Team8 has already launched two cyber companies, Claroty and Illusive Networks, and two others will follow suit soon. Team8 co-founder and CEO Nadav Zafrir told Reuters that one company will move out of stealth mode in a few weeks while another will do the same in early 2018 without elaborating. He noted that each of the syndicate members has a different perspective on cyber.  “Citi enables us to see the world from a financial standpoint. With Intel joining we will see the challenges going forward in cybersecurity like computing, automotive, cloud, mobile and IoT (Internet of Things),” Zafrir said. “Together we can address the (cyber) problems before they emerge.” Intel will also collaborate with Illusive, which catches attackers once they break into corporate networks using deception technologies, to help combat so-called advanced persistent threats (APTs). The alliance between Illusive and Intel extends deception-based cyber security from software to hardware, Illusive said. “Our collaboration with Illusive networks provides users with more effective defenses against sophisticated APTs, in the early stage of the attack, that otherwise go undetected and pose a great threat to enterprises and individuals,” said Jacob Mendel, general manager of Intel’s platform security division.

23,INTC,UPDATE 2-Imagination Tech up for sale after bruising Apple fight,"LONDON (Reuters) - Imagination Technologies, the British firm that lost 70 percent of its value after being ditched by its biggest customer Apple, put itself up for sale on Thursday in a disappointing end to a once-great European tech success story.  Founded in 1985 and listed in 1994, Imagination has been rocked by Apple’s announcement in April that it was developing its own graphics chips and would no longer use Imagination’s processing designs in 15 months to two years time. Apple’s decision, which analysts said posed an existential threat to the company, sent Imagination’s shares plummeting 70 percent on April 3 and they have barely recovered since. The stock jumped as much as 21 percent on Thursday, however, after the sale announcement to 149.5 pence, giving the company a market capitalization of 425 million pounds ($538 million).  Analysts said potential buyers could include Intel, Qualcomm, Mediatek, CEVA and various entities from China, while Apple itself could be interested. “Imagination Technologies announces that over the last few weeks it has received interest from a number of parties for a potential acquisition of the whole group,” the company said.  “The board of Imagination has therefore decided to initiate a formal sale process for the group and is engaged in preliminary discussions with potential bidders.” Imagination has said it doubted Apple, which accounts for about half of its sales, could go it alone without violating Imagination’s patents. Analysts said legal battles were likely and Imagination started a dispute resolution procedure in May with the U.S. giant, which is valued at $761 billion. The British company initially responded to Apple’s decision to walk away by putting two of its main divisions up for sale. “That was a pretty dire scenario, akin to selling off the family silver to keep the estate going a little longer,” said Neil Wilson, Senior Market Analyst, ETX Capital. “Now the shutters are up and a buyer sought. A pretty ignominious end to what was a great British tech success story.” Imagination has licensed its processing designs to Apple from the time of the first iPod and receives a small royalty on every device using its graphics. Imagination’s shares rose sharply between 2009 and 2012 as sales of smartphones boomed, prompting Apple and Intel to buy stakes and the company was valued at more than 2 billion pounds in April 2012. Apple owns 8 percent of the shares. Imagination struggled, however, to reduce its reliance on Apple, and has faced increased competition from the likes of chipmaker Qualcomm and British rival ARM, which developed its own graphics to complement its core processor blueprints. Imagination downplayed fears it could lose Apple contract for years. Facing reports that Apple was building a graphics operation and hiring Imagination staff, the British firm told investors that Apple was just improving its customization of the technology Imagination sold, rather than replacing it.     Analysts at Stifel said they thought interested parties could include those groups that want to develop their own processing technology across platforms such as mobile, wearable tech, vehicles and the so-called Internet of Things. “This could include a coordinated Chinese bid, a hyper-scale vendor from the cloud or some other IP player,” they said.  Imagination said on Thursday it had received indicative proposals for its embedded MIPS technology - processors used in vehicles and home appliances - and its mobile connectivity division Ensigma, the two businesses put up for sale in the wake of the slide in its shares. While Imagination has other clients for its technology, UBS analysts estimated in April that its non-Apple business was worth just 81 million pounds and the MIPS division, which it bought for $100 million in 2013, was worth 77 million pounds. UBS said the company could be worth 110 pence per share on a sum of the parts basis. In May, Jefferies said the wind up value was about 96 pence a share while Morgan Stanley said the company could be worth as little as 106 million pounds, or just 30 pence per share, though its base case was 95 pence. The U.S. investment bank said Imagination’s headquarters was worth 40 million pounds.

24,INTC,EU court seen ruling on Intel antitrust case next year - judge,"PARIS, June 26 (Reuters) - Europe’s top court is likely to rule on Intel’s appeal against a record 1.06 billion euro ($1.19 billion) EU antitrust fine next year, an EU judge said on Monday, a case that may affect companies such as Google and Qualcomm in the EU’s crosshairs. The European Commission hit Intel with the record penalty seven years ago, accusing it of trying to stifle rival Advanced Micro Devices by giving rebates to PC makers Dell , Hewlett-Packard Co, NEC and Lenovo for buying most of their computer chips from Intel. The U.S. chipmaker subsequently challenged the decision at the Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe’s second highest. Judges rejected its arguments in 2014, saying the Commission had not acted too harshly in handing down the sanction amounting to 4.15 percent of Intel’s 2008 turnover against a possible maximum of 10 percent. The company then appealed to the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ). “I expect a judgment sometime next year,” Marc van der Woude, vice-president at the General Court, told a competition conference organised by Concurrence. Intel got a boost last year when ECJ court adviser Nils Wahl questioned whether the company’s actions had really harmed competition. The court follows such recommendations in four out of five cases. Google has been charged with promoting its services versus rivals, among other charges, while U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm is fighting EU charges of using anti-competitive methods, including giving rebates, to squeeze a rival.

30,INTC,Samsung on track to take Intel's chip crown with record Q2 earnings,"SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) is expected to report its best-ever quarterly profit in the second quarter, with soaring memory chip sales pushing it past Intel Corp (INTC.O) as the biggest semiconductor maker by revenue for the first time.  The world’s largest memory chip maker is the among the biggest beneficiaries of soaring demand for processing firepower on smartphones and servers, which has fueled an industry super-cycle amid limited supply growth. Underscoring its dominant position, Samsung said on Tuesday it plans to invest some $18.6 billion in South Korea as it seeks to extend its lead in memory chips and next-generation displays for smartphones. The South Korean tech giant, Asia’s third-largest company by market capitalization, is now poised to knock Intel off the top of the global semiconductor market-share rankings for the first time since 1991.  “From the second quarter, Samsung will become No. 1 in market share due to the recent increase in data centers and demand for solid-state drives,” NH Investment & Securities analyst Peter Lee wrote in a note to clients.   Samsung’s April-June operating profit is expected to leap 67 percent from a year earlier to 13.1 trillion won ($11.4 billion), a new high, according to the average forecast from a Thomson Reuters survey of 18 analysts.  The same survey expects July-September profit to be even higher at 13.8 trillion won.  Solid sales of the Galaxy S8 smartphone launched in April likely provided an additional boost, keeping the firm ahead of rival Apple Inc (AAPL.O) as the world’s top smartphone maker. The S8’s performance has reassured investors whose nerves were shaken last year by the costly withdrawal of Samsung’s premium Galaxy Note 7 due to fire-prone batteries. Samsung shares are trading at a near-record high of 2.35 million won each as of Tuesday. They have gained 30 percent so far this year on top of a 43 percent surge in 2016.  “The Galaxy S8 series has been out for more than 2 months now and we see similar traction as the Galaxy S7 series,” Counterpoint analyst Tom Kang said.  Samsung would sell about 49 million S8s by the end of its first full-year release, in line with first-year sales of the Galaxy S7, he said.  Samsung is also preparing to unveil the Galaxy Note 8 in August, a source told Reuters, restoring the company’s schedule of market-moving gadget releases after the interruption of the Note 7 debacle.  The company will issue earnings guidance early on Friday but will not disclose details on its performance until late July.   Nomura has predicted DRAM chip prices will continue to rise in the second half of 2017 due to limited supply and strong demand driven by servers. Demand for solid-state drives (SSD) and smartphones would maintain profits for producers of NAND semiconductors, despite an easing of a production bottleneck, it said.

31,INTC,"Intel, John McAfee settle lawsuits over antivirus pioneer's name","NEW YORK (Reuters) - John McAfee, the creator of eponymous antivirus computer software, has settled a lawsuit against Intel Corp (INTC.O) over his right to use his name on other projects after the chipmaker bought his former company. U.S. District Judge Paul Oetken in Manhattan dismissed McAfee’s September 2016 lawsuit and a countersuit by Intel on Wednesday, five days after a settlement agreement was signed. McAfee said he sued after Intel warned him that using his name, including by renaming his digital gaming and cybersecurity company MGT Capital Investments Inc (MGTI.PK) as “John McAfee Global Technologies Inc,” would infringe its trademarks. Intel countered by accusing McAfee of trademark infringement and unfair competition, and sought unspecified damages. Under the settlement, McAfee agreed not to use his name, trademark his name or the phrase “John McAfee Privacy Phone,” or use “John McAfee Global Technologies” in connection with cybersecurity- and security-related products and services. He retained the right in other contexts to use his name in advertising, promotions and presentations, including with regard to his role at McAfee Associates, which he sold to Intel for $7.7 billion in 2010. Neither McAfee nor Intel admitted wrongdoing in agreeing to the settlement, which was amicable, according to court papers. McAfee’s lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Intel said the Santa Clara, California-based company was pleased to settle. Intel spun off its cybersecurity division, now called McAfee LLC, in April, after agreeing to sell a 51 percent stake to private investment firm TPG Capital.

37,INTC,"Qualcomm accuses Apple of infringing six patents in iPhone, iPad","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc will ask the U.S. International Trade Commission to bar Apple Inc from selling some iPhones and iPads in the United States that use chips made by competitor Intel Corp on the grounds that the devices infringe on six Qualcomm patents. In a request that would broaden its legal battle with Apple, San Diego-based Qualcomm said it will ask the U.S. ITC to ban imports of the infringing Apple devices. A related lawsuit was filed in federal court in California on Thursday to request monetary damages. Qualcomm, which also supplies chips to Apple, said the six patents help devices perform well without draining the battery. Apple referred reporters to its earlier comments on the dispute with Qualcomm, which accuse Qualcomm of unfairly imposing what Apple calls a “tax” on Apple devices using Qualcomm chips. In its complaint to the ITC, Qualcomm asked the body to ban “iPhones that use cellular baseband processors other than those supplied by Qualcomm’s affiliates.” Qualcomm did not name Intel, but Intel began supplying chips for some iPhones starting with the iPhone 7. Qualcomm has not alleged that Intel chips violate its patents but claims that the way Apple implements them in the iPhone does. Intel declined comment. Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein, said ITC cases typically take 16 months to conclude and the case was unlikely to affect Apple’s 10th anniversary iPhone launch expected this fall. “I doubt this puts a lot of immediate pressure on Apple,” Rasgon said. There has been long-running tension between Qualcomm and Apple over Qualcomm’s practice of taking a cut of the total price of the phone in exchange for “modem” chips that help phones use wireless networks data plans. The ITC is a popular venue for patent disputes because it handles cases relatively quickly and can more easily bar an infringing product from the U.S. market than federal courts. Animosity between the two companies burst into the open in January, when the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm and accused it of using “anticompetitive” tactics to maintain its monopoly on a key semiconductor used in mobile phones. The FTC, which enforces antitrust law along with the Justice Department, said that Qualcomm used its dominant position as a supplier of certain chips to impose “onerous” supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers and to weaken competitors. Days later, Apple sued Qualcomm for $1 billion, accusing it of overcharging for chips and withholding promised rebates because of Apple’s discussions with South Korea’s antitrust regulators in their probe of Qualcomm.

41,INTC,Intel rolls out new chips in battle for data center business,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Intel Corp on Tuesday announced a new line of microprocessors for data centers, setting up a battle with Advanced Micro Devices and others for the lucrative business of supplying the chips that power cloud computing. The new Xeon Scalable Processor chips provide far greater support for next-generation computing applications such as artificial intelligence and driverless cars, said Naveen Rao, vice president of Intel’s artificial intelligence products group, in an interview with Reuters. The chips are aimed at companies including Alphabet’s Google, Microsoft Corp, Amazon.com Inc  and others that operate data centers with thousands of computers, both to power their own services and to provide computing horsepower for customers who don’t want to own and maintain their own computer systems.  Google Cloud Platform was the first data center to adopt the new Intel processors. Paul Nash, project manager for Google Compute Engine, called the deal an “expansion and deepening of our partnership” with Intel. But Intel will face stiff competition from historic rival AMD, which recently launched its own next-generation data center processor. The big Internet companies are also doing more of their own hardware design and experimenting with chips based on technology from ARM Holdings and others, partly as a way of pushing Intel to keep prices in line. Martin Reynolds, an analyst at Gartner, said the new Intel processor is a step up from its previous generation with better power efficiency, improvement on artificial intelligence workload and more advanced storage. Reynolds noted that the biggest risk for Intel may be its dependence on a relatively small number of big data center operators. “The challenge now is so much of our their work is going to these big internet guys,” he said, and thus demand for chips is subject to how successful the companies are in the fierce battle for customers who are moving their computing to the cloud.

A lobbying group that represents Alphabet Inc’s Google , Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp and Facebook Inc filed comments with the U.S. International Trade Commission. They argued that barring Apple from importing foreign-assembled iPhones that use Intel Corp chips - as Qualcomm has requested - would cause “significant shocks to supply” for phones and would hurt consumers. Intel and Apple rival Samsung are members of the group, called the Computer & Communications Industry Association. Apple is not a member of the group. “If the ITC were to grant this exclusion order, it would help Qualcomm use its monopoly power for further leverage against Apple and allow them to drive up prices on consumer devices,” Ed Black, the CEO of the group, said in a statement. “What’s at stake here is certainly the availability of iPhones and other smartphones at better prices.” Qualcomm supplies so-called modem chips to Apple, which help iPhones and iPads connect to cellular data networks. The two have been locked in a sprawling legal battle in which Apple has objected to Qualcomm’s business model of requiring customers to sign patent license agreements before buying chips. In turn, Qualcomm has accused Apple of directing its contract manufacturers like Foxconn to withhold license payments in a bid to hurt Qualcomm. The conflict has taken a toll on Qualcomm’s profit outlook. Earlier this month, Qualcomm sued Apple on separate allegations that Apple infringed six patents around making iPhones work better without draining the battery.

51,INTC,Qualcomm accuses tech group of 'misdirecting' trade regulators,"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) fired back in its case against Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Monday, accusing its critics of waging a “coordinated effort aimed at misdirecting” trade regulators. Earlier this month, Qualcomm filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission seeking to ban iPhones that use chips “other than those supplied by Qualcomm affiliates.” Apple began using Intel chips in the iPhone 7. Last week, a lobbying group that represents Alphabet Inc’s Google (GOOGL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Facebook Inc (FB.O) argued that barring Apple from importing foreign-assembled iPhones that use Intel Corp (INTC.O) chips would cause “significant shocks to supply” for phones and would hurt consumers. Intel and Apple rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) are also members of the group, called the Computer & Communications Industry Association. Apple is not a member of the group. Qualcomm supplies so-called modem chips to Apple, which help iPhones and iPads connect to cellular data networks.

In turn, Qualcomm has accused Apple of directing its contract manufacturers like Foxconn (2317.TW) to withhold license payments in a bid to hurt Qualcomm. The conflict has taken a toll on Qualcomm’s profit outlook. In its filing on Monday, Qualcomm argued that its import ban is not actually about Intel’s chips, but instead concerns the patented technology that surrounds the Intel chips in current versions of the iPhone. Thus a ban on importing the phones would not hurt competition in the long term, Qualcomm argued. “Apple can purchase and utilize any LTE modem it chooses so long as it does not infringe Qualcomm’s asserted patents,” the company wrote. Qualcomm also said many other companies - including MediaTek Inc (2454.TW), Samsung, Marvell Technology Group (MRVL.O), Leadcore, Spreadtrum, and HiSilicon - also make modem chips and could supply the smartphone industry. Asked for comment, Apple reiterated its previous stance on Qualcomm’s business model, saying that Qualcomm supplies Apple “with a single connectivity component, but for years have been demanding a percentage of the total cost of our products - effectively taxing Apple’s innovation.” ",7242017,http://www.reuters.com/article/apple-qualcomm/qualcomm-accuses-tech-group-of-misdirecting-trade-regulators-idUSL1N1KF1FW
52,INTC,Samsung takes aim at TSMC with plans to triple chip foundry market share,"YONGIN, SOUTH KOREA (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) plans to triple the market share of its contract chip manufacturing business within the next five years by aggressively adding clients, a senior company executive said, as it targets new growth drivers for the chips business. The estimated 5.3 trillion won ($4.76 billion) business at Samsung was split off as a separate arm within its semiconductor division in May, in a clear statement that the technology giant was preparing to focus on the business and narrow the big market share gap with leader TSMC (2330.TW). E.S. Jung, executive vice president and head of the new Samsung foundry division, told Reuters on Monday at the South Korean company’s Giheung chip campus the firm wants a 25 percent market share within five years and will seek to attract smaller customers in addition to big-name clients to fuel the growth. “We want to become a strong No. 2 player in the market,” Jung said. Samsung is on track for record profits and is widely expected to pass Intel Corp (INTC.O) as the world’s top chipmaker by sales in 2017 on the back of a memory market boom. But the firm lags well behind Taiwan’s TSMC in contract manufacturing: TSMC held a market share of 50.6 percent last year compared with Samsung’s 7.9 percent, according to research firm IHS. It also trailed U.S.-based Global Foundries, which had a 9.6 percent share, and Taiwan-based UMC’s (2303.TW) 8.1 percent.   The memory industry is notoriously cyclical and unlikely to repeat the massive revenue gains seen this year. And as new applications such as cloud computing, autonomous driving and virtual reality emerge, analysts say Samsung needs to strengthen the rest of its chip portfolio to secure future growth. Jung declined to comment on revenue or investment targets, but said foundry and memory businesses will share the 6 trillion won next-generation chip production line that will be built in Hwaseong, South Korea. Samsung doesn’t reveal its chip contract manufacturing revenue, but analysts estimated it at 5.3 trillion won last year, with Daishin Securities forecasting it will see an increase of 10 percent or more this year.  While TSMC splurges around $10 billion of capital expenditure annually, Jung said Samsung will be able to keep production capacity flexible depending on market demand by relying on memory chip lines. Though Samsung already counts major firms such as Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI.O) as clients, it has a long way to go to catch up to TSMC. Analysts estimate Samsung lost Apple to TSMC in 2015 and the Taiwan firm has had 100 percent of Apple’s mobile processor business in 2016 and 2017. “You need a technology that can wow your clients. Without such advanced technology, it’ll be difficult to win back customers from your rivals,” Jung said, without specifying any clients’ names. He said Samsung was confident of producing chips using the latest manufacturing technology called EUV (extreme ultraviolet) lithography ahead of rivals. EUV is a next-generation technology that potentially lowers the cost and complexity of chip manufacturing. Samsung and TSMC are neck-and-neck in introducing EUV.  Samsung says it will start manufacturing chips with circuitry widths of 7 nano meters by using EUV tech in the second half of 2018. TSMC also said earlier this month that its chip manufacturing process using EUV technology will be the “most advanced technology in foundry industry” in 2018 in terms of density, performance and power.

53,INTC,Israeli professor settles Mobileye insider trading case in U.S.,"(Reuters) - An Israeli professor has agreed to pay more than $850,000 to settle U.S. claims he engaged in insider trading in Jerusalem-based Mobileye NV MBLY.N, a maker of sensors and cameras for self-driving vehicles, ahead of its $15.3 billion takeover by Intel Corp (INTC.O). According to an agreement filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday in Manhattan federal court, Ariel Darvasi, a genetics professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, will pay about $854,000. The agreement must be approved by U.S. District Judge Richard Berman. “I have now agreed to a settlement under which I do not admit anything, I do not deny anything, and obviously I was not convicted of any wrongdoing,” Darvasi said in a statement sent through a spokesman for the university. “I am currently fighting pancreatic cancer and a civil trial in a faraway foreign country is unfortunately beyond my strengths.” University spokesman Dov Smith said the university was not involved in the case had no comment. The SEC in March charged that Darvasi, of Mevaseret Zion, Israel, and another Israeli, Amir Waldman, made “remarkably timed” purchases of Mobileye shares and call options prior to Intel’s March 13 acquisition of Mobileye. The SEC said the purchases resulted in about $427,000 of profit for Darvasi and $4.5 million for Waldman, after the announcement caused shares of Mobileye to rise 28.2 percent in one day. Darvasi’s settlement represents the profit he was accused of making, plus a civil penalty of the same amount. According to the SEC, both defendants were connected to Mobileye insiders through the Hebrew University scientific community, which developed Mobileye technology and produced at least 11 Mobileye directors and officers. Waldman, of Yarqona, Israel, is a self-employed engineer, according to the SEC’s complaint. Gregory Bruch, a lawyer for Waldman, said the claims against his client were still pending and declined to comment further. According to the SEC, Darvasi began buying Mobileye stock on March 2 after selling 40,000 shares of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, the only securities in his account. The SEC said Waldman conducted most of his Mobileye trading in the six weeks before the Intel Corp deal was announced. The trading began the day Intel and Mobileye signed a non-disclosure agreement, and generated a 1,883 percent return. Neither Mobileye nor Santa Clara, California-based Intel was accused of wrongdoing.  The case is SEC v Darvasi et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-02088.

The SEC in March charged that Darvasi, of Mevaseret Zion, Israel, and another Israeli, Amir Waldman, made “remarkably timed” purchases of Mobileye shares and call options prior to Intel’s March 13 acquisition of Mobileye. The SEC said the purchases resulted in about $427,000 of profit for Darvasi and $4.5 million for Waldman, after the announcement caused shares of Mobileye to rise 28.2 percent in one day. Darvasi’s settlement represents the profit he was accused of making, plus a civil penalty of the same amount. According to the SEC, both defendants were connected to Mobileye insiders through the Hebrew University scientific community, which developed Mobileye technology and produced at least 11 Mobileye directors and officers. Waldman, of Yarqona, Israel, is a self-employed engineer, according to the SEC’s complaint. Gregory Bruch, a lawyer for Waldman, said the claims against his client were still pending and declined to comment further. According to the SEC, Darvasi began buying Mobileye stock on March 2 after selling 40,000 shares of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, the only securities in his account. The SEC said Waldman conducted most of his Mobileye trading in the six weeks before the Intel Corp deal was announced. The trading began the day Intel and Mobileye signed a non-disclosure agreement, and generated a 1,883 percent return. Neither Mobileye nor Santa Clara, California-based Intel was accused of wrongdoing.  The case is SEC v Darvasi et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-02088.

57,INTC,"Intel lifts forecasts as driverless tech, AI add to PC gains","(Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel Corp raised its full-year revenue and profit forecasts on higher expectations for its mainstay personal computer business and growth in newer areas such as artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. Shares of the world’s largest chipmaker, which also beat second-quarter estimates, were up 1.3 percent in after-hours trading on Thursday. Intel has been grappling with a declining PC industry it helped found and has been pushing into making chips that power data centers and also into autonomous vehicle technology. The company agreed in March to buy autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye NV, thrusting Intel into the forefront of the market.  Intel expects to close the Mobileye purchase in the current quarter, several months earlier than expected, Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on a post-earnings call on Thursday.

68,INTC,Verizon stuns Kangaroo market with debut bond print Down Under,"SYDNEY, Aug 4 (IFR) - Verizon Communications (Baa1/BBB+/A–) has reopened Australia’s Kangaroo bond market for global corporate issuers with a stunning four-tranche print that can only encourage further issuance from offshore blue chips. The US telecom giant smashed expectations with a A$2.2 billion ($1.76 billion) four-tranche issue. It is the first Kangaroo bond from a corporate issuer this year and the second-biggest corporate bond in the Australian dollar market, just shy of Apple’s A$2.25 billion three-tranche Kangaroo debut in August 2015. Verizon priced well inside guidance levels and in line with its US dollar curve, said market sources. The A$500 million 5.5-year floating-rate note priced 122 basis points wide of three-month BBSW, 8bp below 130bp area guidance, while the A$550 million 3.5 percent fixed-rated February 2023s priced at asset swaps plus 122bp. The A$450 million 4.05 percent seven-year and A$700m 4.5 percent 10-year notes priced 157bp and 185b over asset swaps, versus respective guidance in the 160bp area and 190bp area. Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan were joint lead managers for the trade. Verizon’s jumbo financing again highlights the pent-up demand for corporate credit in Australia’s bank-dominated local market. Local corporate bond sales have jumped to A$8 billion this year versus just A$1.6 billion in same period in 2016 and A$5.1 billion in the whole of last year. Apple revealed the Australian market’s potential as a global funding alternative in 2015 with its inaugural A$2.25 billion four-year and seven-year debut in August 2015 that smashed the previous A$500 million record for corporate Kangaroos. US chipmaker Intel followed with a A$800 million sale of four and seven-year Kangaroos in November 2015. In June 2016, Coca-Cola raised A$1 billion from a four and eight-year issuance, the same month Apple returned with a A$1.425 billion four-year, 7.6-year and 10-year offering. Three other corporate Kangaroos last year raised between A$175 million and A$350 million from single tranche trades. US companies have issued bonds overseas in recent years to avoid high US corporate tax rates levied on repatriated overseas profits. Companies have chosen to keep profits offshore, issuing bonds in foreign currencies and swapping proceeds back to US dollars to help pay dividends and finance stock buybacks. US motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson, rated A3/A– (Moody’s/S&P;), could follow Verizon having held investor meetings in Australia and Singapore in March for a possible Kangaroo debut. Verizon has had a busy week in the Asian capital markets. It also priced a $950 million 5.15 percent 33-year non-call five Formosa bond in the Taiwanese market. Citigroup and BNP Paribas Taipei were local underwriters while Citigroup and Goldman Sachs were structuring agents on the trade. Verizon is a huge bond issuer with over $116 billion-equivalent in bonds outstanding, the vast majority of which is in US dollars. This total includes $3 billion of 16-year notes sold on Tuesday as part of a liability management exercise to take out a number of high-coupon legacy bonds as well as other short-term debt.

78,INTC,BlackBerry rally derailed as investors lose patience on turnaround,"TORONTO (Reuters) - BlackBerry Ltd (BB.TO)BBRY.O shares have been plunging from their more than two-year high hit in June after lackluster earnings and competitive threats have raised doubts about prospects for a turnaround at the business software maker. At Friday’s price of about $8.70, BlackBerry’s U.S.-traded shares have lost a quarter of their value since reaching a high of $11.74 on June 1.  The stock had rallied from a low of $6.65 in early March on hopes for the company’s QNX industrial operating system for self-driving cars, but investors have started to reassess the yearslong effort by BlackBerry to move beyond the smartphones that made its name a household word.  “It’s been a turnaround story now for about five years,” said Joel Kulina, a technology-sector market maker for Wedbush Securities. “People don’t have the patience.”  Chief Executive Officer John Chen has spent years remaking BlackBerry as a software company focused on selling to automakers and other industrial businesses.   Revenue, which peaked at about $20 billion when BlackBerry was dominating the smartphone market, has fallen sharply. Analysts expect it to drop below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004 and decline again in the following fiscal year. “We’re not going to jump in before we see some signs of turning the corner and establishing meaningful profitability,” said wealth manager Chris Zaccarelli, whose Cornerstone Financial Partners in Huntersville, North Carolina, advises on $1.2 billion of assets. In late June, BlackBerry reported quarterly earnings that missed analysts’ forecasts due to an unexpected sales decline, ramping up pressure on the company to meet its goal of boosting software and services revenue by 10 percent to 15 percent this year. BlackBerry declined to comment on the stock price, but QNX manager Grant Courville said it expected to sign deals with at least three major companies to get QNX into self-driving vehicles.  Last year BlackBerry announced a deal for Ford Motor Co (F.N) to expand use of QNX, which is used mostly in car information and entertainment systems. The companies have provided few details on the arrangement. QNX, which is already in most automobile “infotainment” systems, is one product that BlackBerry bulls talked up as the stock rallied earlier this year, saying the plans to expand its use in other parts of vehicles could generate significant revenue.  Yet investors “are figuring out that it isn’t a straight path to a pot of gold” for QNX, said CIBC Markets analyst Todd Coupland. Intel Corp (INTC.O) poses one threat to QNX. The world’s No. 1 chipmaker owns a rival operating system and this year paid $15.3 billion to buy Mobileye, a maker of sensors and cameras for self-driving vehicles. Luxury carmaker Audi (NSUG.DE) is using Intel’s system in the safety-related electronic control unit for its 2018 A8 sedan, which will be one of the most advanced self-driving cars on the road. Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) last week joined a self-driving technology alliance whose members include Intel, Ericsson (ERICb.ST) and Denso Corp (6902.T) but not BlackBerry.  BlackBerry’s Courville discounted the threat from Intel. He said QNX was being used in at least six automotive programs based on Intel chips, some for self-driving vehicles.

84,INTC,Landmark Intel judgment critical for other EU antitrust cases,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe’s top court will rule on Wednesday whether U.S. chipmaker Intel offered illegal rebates to squeeze out rivals in a judgment that could affect EU antitrust regulators’ cases against Qualcomm and Alphabet’s Google. The ruling by the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) could also provide more clarity on whether rebates are anti-competitive by nature or whether enforcers need to prove the anti-competitive effect. The European Commission in a 2009 decision said that Intel tried to thwart rival Advanced Micro Devices by giving rebates to PC makers Dell [DI.UL], Hewlett Packard, NEC and Lenovo for buying most of their computer chips from the company. It handed down a 1.06 billion euro ($1.3 billion) fine, a record that was subsequently eclipsed by the 2.4 billion euro fine levied on Google in June this year. A lower court upheld the EU competition authority’s decision in 2014, but last year an ECJ court adviser backed Intel’s arguments. An adverse ruling for the Commission on Wednesday could result in a radical review of ongoing cases, said Andrew Ward, a partner at Madrid-based law firm Cuatrecasas. “A loss in such a high-profile case would be embarrassing (for the regulator),” he said, adding that it might mean that long-established theories and processes would need to be reassessed. “Losing against Intel would clearly be a blow to the Commission and a confidence boost for Google, since on the face of it the theory of harm is much more established in the Intel case.” Google has come under fire from the EU over its Android smartphone operating system and online search advertising.  U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm, meanwhile, faces EU charges of using anti-competitive methods to squeeze out British phone software maker Icera and of making illegal payments to a major customer for exclusively using its chipsets since 2011. It would be a rare departure, however, for the ECJ to go against the Commission. “If the Commission wins, it will be business as usual. They will be even more confident in their agenda,” another lawyer said.

86,INTC,Court orders Intel case review in EU antitrust blow,"LUXEMBOURG/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe’s top judges dealt a rare blow to European Union antitrust regulators on Wednesday by sending their case against U.S. chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) back to court for an appeal. In a move that may have ramifications for EU cases against Qualcomm (QCOM.O) and Google (GOOGL.O), the EU Court of Justice (ECJ) said a court which upheld a 1 billion euro ($1.3 billion) fine against Intel should re-examine the company’s appeal. “The case is referred back to the General Court in order for it to examine the arguments put forward by Intel concerning the capacity of the rebates at issue to restrict competition,” the ECJ said in a statement. The Commission handed down the fine in 2009, a record at the time, saying Intel had tried to block rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) by giving rebates to computer makers Dell [DI.UL], Hewlett-Packard Co (HPE.N), NEC (6701.T) and Lenovo (0992.HK) for buying most of their chips from Intel. Regulators have generally frowned upon rebates, especially those offered by dominant companies, on the theory they are anti-competitive in nature. Companies say regulators must prove rebates have anti-competitive effects before sanctioning them. “This is a setback for the Commission as it will be more closely scrutinized by the courts in the future. There is now a clear obligation to look at effects-based arguments,” said Foad Hoseinian at law firm Freshfields. “Companies will be more confident when they go to the Commission and more corporations will have the appetite to take the Commission to court on effects-based arguments,” he said. The Commission said it would study the judgment carefully and that it was up to the General Court to review its decision. Intel said: “We have always believed that our actions were lawful and did not harm competition.” The decade-long case could drag on for several more years as Intel could appeal the General Court’s judgment following the re-examination, if it goes against the company.  The ruling raises the bar for regulators when it comes to proving wrongdoing, said Rein Wesseling, a partner at law firm Stibbe. “It forces the Commission to be as economic in its approach in other cases as it did in Intel. This is encouraging for Qualcomm and Google,” he said. Google, which was hit with a 2.42 billion euro fine in June for favouring its own shopping service, is also under fire over its Android smartphone operating system and online search advertising. Google has denied any wrongdoing. U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm faces EU charges of using anti-competitive methods to squeeze out British phone software maker Icera and of making illegal payments to a major customer for exclusively using its chipsets since 2011.

89,INTC,Intel to update 5G testing device to meet standards,"NEW YORK, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel Corp said on Thursday that it was updating 5G equipment that will allow telecom companies like AT&T; Inc and Verizon Communications Inc to run trials based on standards to be released later this year. A 5G network is expected to offer faster speeds, more capacity and shorter response times while supporting uses ranging from self-driving cars to remote surgeries. Telecom companies and their suppliers consider it to be a multibillion-dollar revenue opportunity. Intel has five 5G trials with global service providers and 15 more in the pipeline, Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich said on a post-earnings conference call in July. One such trial, with wireless carrier AT&T;, involves a 5G broadband service that could be introduced as soon as late 2018. Intel’s mobile trial equipment, which looks like a large box, handles the processing needs for a 5G connection. The updated version, slated for the fourth quarter, will support new 5G standards that the Third Generation Partnership Project, a telecom group known as 3GPP, is expected to release in late 2017. As a result, the new platform will allow Intel’s partners to “really see what works and what doesn’t,” Rob Topol, general manager of 5G business and technology, said in an interview. Intel participated in 3GPP’s working groups to develop the 5G standards, Topol said. 3GPP also developed current mobile phone standards for 4G LTE.

Samsung announced on Thursday at the Frankfurt Motor Show that it has set up a strategic business unit for autonomous and advanced driver assistance services (ADAS), together with a $300 million fund to invest in automotive start-ups and technology.  “It’s time to communicate our intent to enter the autonomous driving market,” Young Sohn, the company’s president and chief strategy officer, told Reuters. “Samsung has been incubating this business for quite a while.” The world’s biggest maker of semiconductors by revenue, Samsung is a consumer electronics giant that leads markets in products as varied as phones and TVs, displays and memory chips. These assets, and the inside track with car makers provided by its Harman unit, give it confidence to enter an increasingly crowded auto market with other top tech names, Sohn said. Samsung’s two biggest rivals have also moved into the connected car market over the past year, at greater cost: Intel Corp (INTC.O) paid $15.3 billion last month to acquire Mobileye, the current market leader in collision-detection ADAS software, while Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) is seeking regulatory approval for its $47 billion deal to buy NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O), the world’s biggest maker of automotive-grade chips. Harman, best known for its consumer audio speakers, derives 65 percent of sales from its automotive business, supplying navigation services, on-board entertainment systems and vehicle networks that put it at the intersection of connected cars and mobile networks. Auto industry veteran John Absmeier, who before joining Samsung in 2015 ran a pioneering autonomous driving programme at U.S. tier 1 auto supplier Delphi Automotive Plc (DLPH.N), has been named senior vice president of the Samsung automotive business unit. Absmeier will retain his current job as head of smart machines for the Samsung Strategy and Innovation Center in Silicon Valley. Sohn said the Autonomous/ADAS business unit will absorb hundreds of engineers Samsung already has working on autonomous driving technologies. The new unit will sit within the connected car business of Harman, an independent subsidiary of Samsung, a spokesman added. In recent months, Samsung has secured licenses for autonomous driving pilot projects in South Korea and California. Strategy Analytics automotive analyst Roger Lanctot said Samsung is ideally placed to pull together consumer electronics, mobile devices and auto technology, but that entering the market will take time. Samsung has indicated that a 2020 time horizon is reasonable for its strategy to come together, he said. “In the meantime, though, I’d expect to see a variety of clever implementations and pilots to test the waters.” While there is no coherent industry vision yet for what a connected car exactly means, creating openings for them, Harman and Samsung must move quickly in a market where vehicle design cycles can take anywhere from three to five years, he noted. Over the next two to three years, the new Samsung Automotive Innovation Fund will invest in a range of connected car areas including sensors, machine vision, artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, cloud services, mobile connectivity, automotive-grade safety and security, the company said. The first investment will be 75 million euros ($89 million)in TTTech, a Vienna-based firm known for safe, highly reliable network computing systems used in the Boeing Dreamliner, Audi cars including the new Audi A8, and NASA spacecraft, it said. Previous Samsung auto-related investments include AImotive and Renovo for automated driving, Quanergy, for 3D cameras known as LiDAR, and Graphcore, a maker of high-performance artificial intelligence computing. Sohn sought to distinguish his strategy from other consumer tech companies including Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Waymo by underlining that Samsung had no plans to make cars itself but instead would work as a tech ally for car makers. Samsung’s new autos unit will focus on developing core technologies, while Harman will market and integrate these for auto makers, he said. Sohn is also chairman of Harman. Longer term, as driverless cars emerge and vehicle interiors become more like living rooms to keep passengers productive or entertained, Samsung could supply see-through computer displays that can also function as windows and Harman could see demand rise for infotainment systems and noise management technology.

95,INTC,Mapping firm HERE looks beyond driverless cars,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - HERE, the digital mapping company controlled by Germany’s premium carmakers, aims to expand its business not only to offer navigation for self-driving cars but also drones and advanced robotics, Chief Executive Edzard Overbeek told Reuters.  “We are expanding our strategy not just in autonomous driving but also in autonomous things,” Overbeek said in an interview on the sidelines of the Frankfurt Motor Show. “Drones, trucks, advanced robotics.” Germany’s carmakers Daimler, Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and BMW bought HERE from mobile telecoms company Nokia for 2.8 billion euros in 2015 as part of a push into self-driving cars. Intel holds a 15 percent stake and an Asian bidding group made up of Tencent, Navinfo and Singapore’s GIC sovereign wealth fund have an undisclosed percentage.  Since the German takeover, other carmakers including Renault-Nissan have expressed an interest in buying a stake in HERE, but deals have not yet been concluded. “We have multiple conversations ongoing,” Overbeek said, adding that each potential investor must have a strategic rationale, be they car makers or technology suppliers, - dictated by the timing of their own moves into self-driving services.  Before investing, carmakers conduct a high-definition mapping test cycle, where they learn about what other investments need to be made to enable the development of autonomous vehicles.  “Autonomous driving is very much at the forefront of what they are trying to solve. This is not a simple problem,” Overbeek said, adding that Stuttgart is already being mapped to enable local carmakers to start building autonomous car systems. Live data fed from radars, standard cameras and 3D laser sensors on thousands of cars is then used to keep maps updated, in case potholes or new street signs emerge. But storing constantly updated maps on a broad scale - years before driverless cars go mainstream - is impractical, he said. HERE is prioritizing more than a dozen cities in North America and Western Europe with plans to further expand that number by the end of the year, and has worked hard to automate mapmaking to enable a fast rollout. “The question is do (we) have the automation ready to scale up when this thing flies. The answer is yes,” Overbeek said. By 2020, 95 percent of HERE’s map infrastructure will update automatically, the company said.  HERE was also making an effort to target preferred partners which fit geographies where Overbeek wants to expand his mapping footprint.

96,INTC,UPDATE 3-Autoliv lifts shares with plans to split into two listed companies,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden’s Autoliv (ALIVsdb.ST) (ALV.N) said it planned to split into two listed companies, with one focused on high-tech safety gear to capture the rapid growth toward self-driving vehicles, lifting its shares on Thursday. Autoliv is the biggest player by far in the market for safety gear such as airbags and seatbelts which generate the bulk of its earnings. It has yet to reach a dominant position in new fields such as radar, visions systems and driver assistance software that are key for development of self-driving cars. The company believes both businesses are undervalued and hopes the split will make them more appealing to investors. “A reason to do this is to clarify the potential in these businesses,” Autoliv Chief Executive Jan Carlson told Reuters. “To show the strength of possibly the world’s strongest product portfolio in electronics as well as the strong development we have in passive safety.” Investors have been putting pressure on car makers and their suppliers to more clearly identify the growth parts of their businesses, areas such as automated driving, electrification and digital technology. Delphi Automotive (DLPH.N), another major auto supplier, recently announced plans to separate into two entities - one dedicated to internal combustion technology and the other focused on electrification and automation. Autoliv said its listing could happen in about a year, but added that while that was the company’s intention, it was not ruling out alternatives. Analysts at Jefferies noted in a research note the  consolidation opportunities in the electronics business. Autoliv’s Stockholm-listed shares (ALIVsdb.ST) jumped as much as 12 percent and were up 10.5 percent at 1323 GMT. “The split will clearly help to bring the true value of Autoliv’s excellent market positions and strong product offering to the surface,” said John Hernander of Nordea, the firm’s fifth largest shareholder. Autoliv has seen major market share gains on order intake in its traditional, passive safety business over the past two years following the collapse of Japanese rival Takata. But the auto industry’s long lead times have meant that Autoliv is only now starting to reap the full benefits of those business wins, while strong orders in its electronics business will only gradually filter through into sales in coming years.  Extra spending needed to deliver the influx of orders in recent years and technology investments needed have weighed on the stock, while worries have mounted over slower growth in the global car market. Autoliv’s U.S.-listed shares (ALV.N) are flat so far this year, lagging a 16 percent rise in the Dow Jones U.S. Automobiles & Parts Index .DJUSAP. Global carmakers and electronics firms such as Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) are racing to develop the emerging technology of autonomous vehicles. In electronics, Autoliv’s recent tie-ups include a joint venture with Geely-owned Volvo Cars, and partnerships with chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA.O), as well as Velodyne over LiDar technology.     The company said it expected sales to top $12 billion in 2019 while analysts are on average forecasting sales of $11.9 billion in 2019, Thomson Reuters data shows. It also gave sales and profit forecasts for the separate entities for 2020, giving further upside to consensus forecasts, according to Jefferies.

98,INTC,Intel collaborates with Waymo on self-driving computer design,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) on Monday announced a collaboration with Alphabet’s (GOOGL.O) Waymo self-driving unit, saying it had worked with the company during the design of its computer platform to allow autonomous cars to process information in real time. The world’s largest computer chipmaker said its Intel-based technologies for sensor processing, general compute and connectivity were used in the Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans Waymo has been using since 2015 to test its self-driving system. Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich told Reuters that Intel built “a custom piece of silicon” that fit Waymo’s sensor fusion needs and tapped Intel’s processing power.   “Over time we’ll both learn we can bring more of the software ... down onto the silicon, because you get performance, cost and power,” Krzanich said. “There will be a regular cadence of new innovation and new silicon that comes out. That’s really what we both get out of this.”  Intel, which announced the $15 billion acquisition of autonomous vision company Mobileye in March, is pushing to expand in autonomous vehicles, a fast-growing industry, across a variety of business models. A collaboration with Waymo, considered by many industry experts to be at the forefront of autonomous technology, adds to its portfolio. The announcement marked the first time Waymo has acknowledged a collaboration with a supplier. Waymo, which began as the Google self-driving car project, has done most of its development work in-house. Intel began supplying chips for the autonomous program beginning in 2009, but that relationship grew into a deeper collaboration when Google began working with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCHA.MI) to develop and install its autonomous driving technology into the automaker’s minivans. Those vehicles began test drives at the end of 2016. Waymo, which has developed its own sensors, is not using the autonomous vision system created by Mobileye.  Underscoring the non-exclusive partnerships and collaborations in the space, Mobileye and Intel are in an alliance with German automaker BMW (BMWG.DE) and Fiat-Chrysler to create an industrywide autonomous car platform. Waymo CEO John Krafcik said fast processing was crucial to the performance of its autonomous vehicles.  “Intel’s technology supports the advanced processing inside our vehicles, with the ability to manufacture to meet Waymo’s needs at scale,” Krafcik said in a statement. Intel also said on Monday it had invested $1 billion in artificial intelligence companies over the past three years.

103,INTC,Japan's Pioneer teams up with digital mapping company HERE,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Pioneer and digital mapping group HERE said on Tuesday they had agreed to invest in one another so the companies can develop maps for autonomous driving services. They said they aimed to develop car infotainment and autonomous driving, and products for other industries needing location data. The deal also allows Berlin-based HERE to offer maps of Japan to its customers. The agreement builds on a partnership announced earlier this year in which HERE will work with Pioneer’s mapping subsidiary, Increment P, to develop global, high resolution maps and location data services. Under the deal, HERE has agreed to buy 11.12 million newly issued shares of Pioneer common stock, representing a 3 percent stake in Pioneer at a price of 17.3 million euros ($20.7 million, or 2.31 billion yen). For the same price, Pioneer will take a stake in HERE of less than 1 percent through an investment vehicle jointly controlled by HERE’s majority shareholders, Audi, part of Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), BMW and Daimler. The investments are set to close on Oct. 5, they said. Pioneer, once best known for its car stereos, now gets most of its revenue from automotive electronics for infotainment and navigation as well as factory automation and lighting. The Tokyo-based company is also developing low-cost 3D laser cameras, known as LiDAR, that are vital for maps used in autonomous driving. The company is a supplier to major Japanese automakers including Toyota and Honda, as well as Chinese, North American and European car brands. HERE targets selected investors among car makers, mapping companies and technology providers that fit its global plans to develop high resolution maps for autonomous driving, Chief Executive Edzard Overbeek said last week. (reut.rs/2xtPucB) In addition to the three German luxury car groups, HERE shareholders include chipmaker Intel Corp, with a 15 percent stake.

104,INTC,"UPDATE 3-Delphi, BlackBerry partner on self-driving software system","(Reuters) - Auto suppliers Delphi Automotive Plc and BlackBerry Ltd will partner on a software operating system for self-driving cars, the companies said on Wednesday. Delphi already has developed a turnkey self-driving system called CSLP that it plans to begin selling to automakers and other transportation providers in 2019, for production in 2021. Most larger vehicle manufacturers are developing their own self-driving systems. Glen De Vos, Delphi’s chief technology officer, said BlackBerry QNX would provide an operating system that was already certified to high levels of safety for Delphi’s CSLP system, which uses software developed by Delphi’s Ottomatika unit. “You have to have all these pieces together, otherwise what you have is a demo,” De Vos said at a media briefing. De Vos said Delphi expects to begin testing its automated driving systems in pilot projects with ride-service fleets by 2019, with plans to “take the driver out by 2020.” The initial fleets of vehicles will be small and limited to defined routes in cities, he said, including a partnership in Europe with Transdev Group, a Paris-based public transport service. BlackBerry said its operating system would help guard against cyber attacks, malware and system malfunctions - critical concerns for self-driving vehicles. Delphi’s partners on the CSLP platform include Intel Corp’s Mobileye and Silicon Valley startup Renovo.  In May, German automaker BMW AG said Delphi would join it in a self-driving partnership that includes Intel and Mobileye.

Chinese mapping company Navinfo (002405.SZ) said on Tuesday that the company and partners Chinese internet giant Tencent (0700.HK) and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC [GIC.UL] had dropped plans to take a 10 percent stake in the company. HERE, whose controlling shareholders are BMW (BMWG.DE), Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE) and VW’s (VOWG_p.DE) Audi business, is developing high-resolution maps to enable future autonomous driving. Its current generation of lower-resolution mapping services are used for location services in vehicles, by online services and by logistics companies. Navinfo said in a statement that it spent months after the deal was announced in January seeking approval from the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment (CFIUS). But after meeting CFIUS resistance, the group had decided to pull its investment offer. It did not give details of why CFIUS opposed the investment. HERE, the world’s biggest provider of digital maps for the automotive industry, conducts business in the United States and is 15 percent owned by U.S. chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O). Chinese investments in companies the U.S. government considers important to national security have come under increasing scrutiny from CFIUS. An analyst who is familiar with CFIUS, a secretive interagency panel chaired by the U.S. Treasury, said CFIUS has left recent Chinese deals in limbo instead of blocking them outright.   “You get the sense that this (U.S.) administration would just rather have these transactions fall off, just run out the clock on the transactions,” the analyst said. Navinfo, Tencent and GIC had planned to take a 10 percent stake by acquiring shares from BMW, Daimler and Audi. Last year CFIUS blocked plans by a Chinese company to acquire the assets of German electronic chipmaker Aixtron (AIXGn.DE) and a second deal in which Philips (PHG.AS) planned to sell its Lumileds lighting business to a Chinese fund.  Navinfo and Amsterdam-based HERE said in separate statements that they both still planned to cooperate to create high resolution maps for future autonomous driving services in China, without Navinfo or partners taking a financial stake in HERE. “The decision follows a regulatory review process during which the parties determined there was no practicable path to receiving the necessary approval for the transaction to proceed,” HERE said in a statement.

An analyst who is familiar with CFIUS, a secretive interagency panel chaired by the U.S. Treasury, said CFIUS has left recent Chinese deals in limbo instead of blocking them outright.   “You get the sense that this (U.S.) administration would just rather have these transactions fall off, just run out the clock on the transactions,” the analyst said. Navinfo, Tencent and GIC had planned to take a 10 percent stake by acquiring shares from BMW, Daimler and Audi. Last year CFIUS blocked plans by a Chinese company to acquire the assets of German electronic chipmaker Aixtron (AIXGn.DE) and a second deal in which Philips (PHG.AS) planned to sell its Lumileds lighting business to a Chinese fund.  Navinfo and Amsterdam-based HERE said in separate statements that they both still planned to cooperate to create high resolution maps for future autonomous driving services in China, without Navinfo or partners taking a financial stake in HERE. “The decision follows a regulatory review process during which the parties determined there was no practicable path to receiving the necessary approval for the transaction to proceed,” HERE said in a statement. Separately, Japanese auto electronics maker Pioneer Corp (6773.T) said last week that it plans to buy a stake of less than 1 percent in HERE.

115,INTC,Intel lifts full-year forecasts on data center strength,"(Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O), the world’s largest computer chipmaker, raised its full-year revenue and profit forecasts, helped by strong growth in its data center business. The company’s shares were up 2.2. percent at $42.25 in extended trading. For the full year, the company said it expects to earn, on an adjusted basis, $3.25 per share on revenue of $62 billion, beating analysts’ estimate of $3.01 per share on revenue of $61.4 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In July, the company had previously forecast full-year adjusted profit of $3 per share on revenue of $61.3 billion. “The combination of a solid quarter and healthy guidance will be something the bulls can hang their hat on tomorrow,” Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer at GBH Insights said. Revenue from Intel’s higher-margin data center business rose 7 percent to $4.9 billion in the third quarter, beating analysts’ expectation of $4.79 billion, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. “We’re going to see it continue to become a bigger and bigger portion of our business,” Chief Financial Officer Bob Swan said on a call. Intel, which has been switching its focus to the data center business, is also venturing into newer areas such as artificial intelligence and driverless cars to reduce its reliance on the PC market. The chipmaker completed the acquisition of Israeli autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye MBLY.N in August to compete with peers such as Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) and tap the fast-growing market of driverless cars. “With cloud, Internet of Things, and self-driving cars creating newer growth areas, now is the time for Intel to lay the seeds of growth in these key areas,” Ives said. Revenue from client computing, as Intel calls its PC chip business, remained flat at $8.9 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of $8.68 billion, according to FactSet. Intel recently launched its Coffee Lake line of processors, which analysts believe will pose challenges for rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc’s (AMD.O) Ryzen processors.

121,INTC,Cloud computing drives massive growth for big U.S. tech firms,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Alphabet Corp’s (GOOGL.O) Google and Intel Corp (INTC.O) are all putting their chips on the cloud computing business, and it is booming. All four companies posted stellar quarterly earnings on Thursday, showing the strength of the shift in corporate computing away from company-owned data centers and to the cloud. Microsoft’s Azure business nearly doubled, with year-over-year growth of 90 percent. The company does not break out revenue figures for Azure, but research firm Canalys estimates it generated $2 billion for Microsoft. “The move to the cloud was one we felt Microsoft could always benefit from, and they’re showing us that they can,” said Kim Forrest, vice president and senior equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, a portfolio management firm. Highlighting the quarter for Microsoft was a deal securing retailer Costco (COST.O) as an Azure customer. That came just two months after the close of Amazon’s acquisition of grocery chain Whole Foods, which has heightened unease among retail and e-commerce companies about working with Amazon, said Ed Anderson, an analyst with Gartner.  Tim Green, analyst with the Motley Fool, said Amazon could find it needs to make changes at some point at Amazon Web services. “Spinning off AWS at some point down the road might become necessary to prevent an exodus of customers,” he said. Amazon Web Services is still delivering far more revenue than any of its peers. For the quarter, AWS raked in nearly $4.6 billion — a year-over-year increase of 42 percent. AWS may have missed out on Costco, but the company secured deals with Hulu, Toyota Racing Development, and most notably, General Electric. Google Cloud Platform landed deals with the likes of department store retailer Kohl’s and payments processor PayPal. Like Microsoft, Alphabet does not break out revenue for Google Cloud Platform, but Canalys estimates the business generated $870 million in the quarter, up 76 percent year-over-year. Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said Google Cloud Platform is a top-three priority for the company. He said  Google plans to continue expanding its cloud sales force. Canalys estimates the cloud computing market at $14.4 billion for the third quarter of 2017, up 43 percent from a year prior. Amazon holds 31.8 percent of the market, followed by Microsoft at 13.9 percent and Google with 6 percent, according to Canalys’ estimates. The “cloud market will keep growing faster than most of the traditional information technology segment, as the market is still in the developing stage,” said Daniel Liu, research analyst with Canalys. Reflecting the overall growth of the market was the strong performance by Intel, which sells processors and chips to cloud vendors. In July, Intel launched its new Xeon Scalable Processors, which drove 7 percent year-to-year growth for the company’s data center group. The big three cloud vendors also benefit from the decision by many enterprises to build their applications using more than one cloud vendor. Retailers Home Depot Inc (HD.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N), for example, told Reuters they use a combination of cloud providers. “Our philosophy here is to be cloud agnostic, as much as we can,” said Stephen Holmes, a spokesman for Home Depot, which uses both Azure and Google Cloud Platform. Some analysts expect cloud services growth to slow over time as competition increases.  Amazon, for instance, has said that price cuts and new products with lower costs on average are a core part of its cloud business. Additionally, Amazon Web Services saw usage growth outpacing that of revenue growth, said Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky. “Going forward, cloud services will become more of a commodity, and the prices will quickly compress,” said Adam Sarhan, CEO of 50 Park Investments, an investment advisory service. “For now though, it’s a great business with plenty of room for all to grow.” ",10272017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cloud-results/cloud-computing-drives-massive-growth-for-big-u-s-tech-firms-idUSKBN1CW05H

127,INTC,Qualcomm sues Apple for breach of software license contract,"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) has sued Apple Inc (AAPL.O), alleging that it violated a software license contract to benefit rival chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) for making broadband modems, the latest salvo in the longstanding dispute between Qualcomm and Apple. Qualcomm said in a lawsuit filed in California state court in San Diego on Wednesday that Apple used its commercial leverage to demand unprecedented access to the chipmaker’s highly confidential software, including source code. Apple declined to comment on the suit. The company started using Intel’s broadband modem chips in the iPhone 7. In its complaint, Qualcomm alleged that Apple was required under its contract to ensure that Apple engineers working with Qualcomm did not communicate details about Qualcomm chips to Apple engineers working on competing chips from Intel. Qualcomm alleged that in July, Apple emailed Qualcomm to request “highly confidential” information about how its chips work on an unidentified wireless carrier’s network. Apple copied an Intel engineer in the email for information, Qualcomm alleged.

128,INTC,UPDATE 5-Qualcomm sues Apple for breach of software license contract,"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) has sued Apple Inc (AAPL.O), alleging that it violated a software license contract to benefit rival chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) for making broadband modems, the latest salvo in the longstanding dispute between Qualcomm and Apple. Qualcomm said in a lawsuit filed in California state court in San Diego on Wednesday that Apple used its commercial leverage to demand unprecedented access to the chipmaker’s highly confidential software, including source code. Apple declined to comment on the suit. The company started using Intel’s broadband modem chips in the iPhone 7. In its complaint, Qualcomm alleged that Apple was required under its contract to ensure that Apple engineers working with Qualcomm did not communicate details about Qualcomm chips to Apple engineers working on competing chips from Intel. Qualcomm alleged that in July, Apple emailed Qualcomm to request “highly confidential” information about how its chips work on an unidentified wireless carrier’s network. Apple copied an Intel engineer in the email for information, Qualcomm alleged.  In another instance, Qualcomm alleged that an Apple engineer working on a competing chip asked an Apple engineer working with Qualcomm to get technical information from Qualcomm.

137,INTC,Qualcomm buy may pit Broadcom against Intel in 'connected car' fight,"(Reuters) - If Broadcom Ltd’s  unsolicited $103 billion bid for Qualcomm Inc succeeds, it could set up a battle with Intel Corp for dominance in the production of the next generation of communications chips, which will play a vital role in so-called connected cars. Vehicles of every sort already are starting to add wireless chips to download everything from maps to entertainment, and in a few years nearly every new car may be connected. Self-driving cars, still in test mode, will accelerate the move.  “The amount of chips per car is going to grow dramatically,” said Egil Juliussen, a principal analyst for automotive technology at IHSMarkit. Chip makers are scrambling to create new mobile networks, the so-called fifth generation, which will link phones as well as cars, drones and even industrial devices such as smart street lights, which count pedestrians and send data to city planners. Qualcomm long was the dominant communications chip maker for mobile phones, although computer chip maker Intel has begun muscling into the space. Each now supplies about half Apple Inc’s iPhone communications chips, for instance. Now they are jockeying in a mature market to design so-called 5G networks that will be up to 10 times as fast as wireless networks today, which are expected to start rolling out in 2020. Research firm IDC predicts 1.53 billion smart phones will be shipped in 2017 expanding to only 1.77 billion units in 2021. The market for modem chips for cars, by contrast, is expected to grow sharply. Tristan Gerra, a senior semiconductor analyst for Robert W. Baird & Co, said that this year, only about 12 million of the 90 million cars manufactured per year have internet connectivity. But connectivity will become ubiquitous on self-driving cars. “You basically (will) have 80 million units per year that are going to get a modem,” he said. Intel and Qualcomm declined to comment. Qualcomm itself is trying to buy NXP Semiconductors, a maker of automotive chips from so-called “infotainment” system chips to camera systems, for $38 billion. It is unclear whether that deal will go through and whether  Broadcom would take on NXP, but Broadcom has said it is willing to do so. A tie-up between the three companies could create a formidable competitor in the automotive chip space, said IHSMarkit’s  Juliussen. He views Intel and Nvidia Corp, which make both make the main processors used in self-driving vehicles, as leaders in the young market, but a combined Broadcom-Qualcomm-NXP would be a strong third-place. Intel has bought itself into relationships with autonomous car developers thanks to its acquisition of vision system maker Mobileye. Broadcom would get something similar with NXP, Juliussen said. If Broadcom pulls off both deals, its market position in some areas could be dominant, said Cowen and Co analyst Karl Ackerman. “[Broadcom] would basically own the majority of the high-end components in the smart phone market and they would have a very significant influence on 5G standards, which are paramount as you think about autonomous vehicles” and connected factories, he said.

140,INTC,US STOCKS-Doubts about Trump tax cuts weigh on Wall Street,"(Reuters) - Wall Street ended marginally lower on Friday, with losses in Intel and Apple as investors worried about the future of promised corporate tax cuts following dueling plans unveiled by Republican lawmakers. The S&P; 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the week lower for the first time in nine weeks. U.S. Senate Republicans released a tax plan on Thursday that differed from a version put forth by the House of Representatives on several key fronts, including putting off corporate tax cuts for a year. Expectations of lower taxes, one of President Donald Trump’s key campaign promises, have helped drive the S&P; 500 up 20 percent since the 2016 presidential election. Failure to cut corporate taxes would increase concerns about Trump’s ability to pass legislation and could shake markets that have been banking on lower tax rates to boost company earnings. The S&P; 500 on Friday stood at 18.1 times expected earnings, the highest since 2004, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. Arrow Funds Director of Research John Serrapere put the chances of successfully passing meaningful tax cuts at 50 percent, and he warned that failing could trigger a correction of as much as 15 percent in stocks.  “There’s not a lot of confidence. I’m not pessimistic, but there are a lot of pieces that need to be put together,” Serrapere said. The Dow .DJI fell 0.17 percent to end at 23,422.21, while the S&P; 500 .SPX slipped 0.09 percent to 2,582.3. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC edged up 0.01 percent to 6,750.94. For the week, the Dow lost 0.5 percent and the S&P; 500 slipped 0.21 percent. The Nasdaq gave up 0.2 percent for the week, snapping six weeks of weekly gains. Intel (INTC.O) fell 1.55 percent and Apple (AAPL.O) lost 0.33 percent, both accounting more than any other companies for the S&P; 500’s decline. Seven of the 11 major S&P; sectors fell, with the energy index’s .SPNY 0.81 percent dip leading the decliners as oil prices fell. Nvidia (NVDA.O) jumped 5.27 percent and hit a record high  after the chipmaker’s revenue forecast for the current quarter topped estimates. A rise in media stocks also helped limit the slide. Disney (DIS.N) rose 2.05 percent as the promise of a new “Star Wars” trilogy overshadowed its weak quarterly results. Time Warner Inc TWX.N jumped 4.08 percent while News Corp (NWSA.O) climbed 5.15 percent.

145,INTC,U.S. government warns businesses about cyber bug in Intel chips,"(Reuters) - The U.S. government on Tuesday urged businesses to act on an Intel Corp alert about security flaws in widely used computer chips as industry researchers scrambled to understand the impact of the newly disclosed vulnerability. The Department of Homeland Security gave the guidance a day after Intel said it had identified security vulnerabilities in remote-management software known as “Management Engine” that shipped with eight types of processors used in business computers sold by Dell Technologies Inc, Lenovo Group Ltd, HP Inc, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co and other manufacturers.  Security experts said that it was not clear how difficult it would be to exploit the vulnerabilities to launch attacks, though they found the disclosure troubling because the affected chips were widely used.  “These vulnerabilities affect essentially every business computer and server with an Intel processor released in the last two years,” said Jay Little, a security engineer with cyber consulting firm Trail of Bits. For a remote attack to succeed, a vulnerable machine would need to be configured to allow remote access, and a hacker would need to know the administrator’s user name and password, Little said. Attackers could break in without those credentials if they have physical access to the computer, he said. Intel said that it knew of no cases where hackers had exploited the vulnerability in a cyber attack. The Department of Homeland Security advised computer users to review the warning from Intel, which includes a software tool that checks whether a computer has a vulnerable chip. It also urged them to contact computer makers to obtain software updates and advice on strategies for mitigating the threat. (bit.ly/2zqhccw) Intel spokeswoman Agnes Kwan said the company had provided software patches to fix the issue to all major computer manufacturers, though it was up to them to distribute patches to computers users.     Dell’s support website offered patches for servers, but not laptop or desktop computers, as of midday Tuesday. Lenovo offered fixes for some servers, laptops and tablets and said more updates would be available Friday. HP posted patches to its website on Tuesday evening.

150,INTC,Fitch Rates Intel's $2B 30-Year Senior Notes Offering 'A+',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 06 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+' rating to Intel Corp.'s (Intel) $2 billion 3.734% senior notes maturing Dec. 8, 2047, which Intel expects to issue in connection with the first of two concurrent exchange offers intended to retire higher coupon senior notes. Pro forma for settlement of the exchange offers, Intel's total debt decreased by $344 million to approximately $31.3 billion as of Sept. 30, 2017. A full list of current ratings follows at the end of this release. In the first offer, Intel will use net proceeds from the senior notes issuance and $292 million of available cash to retire approximately $1.9 billion of higher couple senior notes that have been either validly tendered and not withdrawn as of expiration date or subject to notice of guaranteed delivery by expiration date. In the second offer, Intel will use approximately $518 million of available cash to retire approximately $435 million of higher coupon senior notes. Intel will use an additional approximately $36 million of available cash for accrued and unpaid interest in aggregate for both exchange offers. KEY RATING DRIVERS Leading Market Positions: Fitch expects Intel's strong market positions in data-centric businesses (estimated 30% market share) and personal computer (PC)-centric businesses (estimated 90% market share) provide significant revenue scale with positive double digit top line growth in data-centric businesses more than offsetting secular decline in PC-centric markets. Technology Leadership: Fitch believes Intel's significant cumulative investments in research and development (R&D;) and manufacturing capabilities have resulted in technology leadership and support Fitch's expectations for top line growth and solid profitability through at least the intermediate term. At the same time, Fitch recognizes Intel's shift in focus to growth markets exposes the company to a greater number of competitors with a breadth of technologies and architectures, along with equally significant financial resources, in many cases. Solid Financial Flexibility: Fitch expects Intel's annual free cash flow (FCF) to remain robust in spite of significant investment requirements, although the majority of FCF is outside the U.S. Fitch estimates more than $3.5 billion of annual FCF through the forecast with upside should Intel achieve its operating profit margin targets in the mid-30s from lower spending offsetting expectations for lower gross profit margins over at least the intermediate term. FCF should provide adequate capacity for organic investments, while Fitch expects Intel will fund sizeable acquisitions, particularly domestic targets, with incremental debt. High Investment Intensity: Fitch expects R&D; and capital spending will continue to represent 35%-40% of revenue, despite Intel's target of trimming other expenses to offset some gross profit erosion. Intel's strategic focus on technology leadership in data-centric markets, including data center, autonomous vehicles and internet of things (IoT), will require significant investments in processors and other areas such as non-volatile memory to differentiate product performance. Customer concentration: Fitch expects customer concentration will intensify over time as cloud service providers (CSP) consolidate information technology (IT) spending. Fitch believes new workloads will remain cloud-native and modernized workloads will continue shifting from on-premise to the cloud, on a net basis. As a result, enterprise IT spending will continue declining by low-single digits while CSPs continue aggressive capacity and capabilities expansion, driving greater customer concentration and, therefore, less even demand patterns. DERIVATION SUMMARY Fitch's rating and Outlook reflects Intel's meaningful intellectual property (IP) portfolio in software, design and manufacturing, leading market share positions, solid profit margins and cash flow resulting in sufficient financial flexibility to maintain high investment levels while conservatively managing its balance sheet. Intel's PC-centric markets (still 55% of core revenue and roughly 60% of operating income), in which the company faces competitors with weaker financial flexibility or competing architectures but limited market penetration, are in secular decline but yield solid cash flow to support Intel's strategic focus on data-centric markets. Intel has lower share in these markets and the company faces a greater number of competitors also with the scale and financial flexibility to maintain high investment rates, particularly within certain markets where technology standards are evolving. While Intel's credit profile currently is in-line with the rating, Fitch believes technology risk in data center, automotive and IoT markets will likely remain heightened for the foreseeable future and could result in outcomes ranging from greater diversification leading to a strengthened credit profile to a weakened credit profile from substantial adoption of competing technologies. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Data Center Group (DCG) grows by mid-single digits through the forecast period, driven by strong demand from CSPs; --IoT grows by double digits through at least the forecast period from solid platform adoption as these markets evolve; --Flat to slightly down Client Computing Group (CCG) growth through the forecast period from continued unit declines offset by a richer PC mix; --Stable operating EBITDA margins due to operating expense reductions offsetting expectations for modest gross profit margin pressures; --Total leverage (total debt to operating EBITDA near 1x from operating EBITDA growth, versus a Fitch estimated 1.2x for the latest 12 months (LTM) ended Sept. 30, 2017 before and after the exchange offers; --Capital spending remains volatile but in the mid-teens through the forecast period; -- $500 million of annual tuck-in acquisitions with no meaningful impact on financial results; --Intel refinances debt maturities and uses domestic cash after dividends and acquisitions for share repurchases. RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action --Total leverage sustained above 1.5x, likely from intensified shareholder returns amid weaker than expected operating performance, given the majority of pre-dividend FCF is offshore. --Negative organic revenue growth from share losses in DCG or slower than anticipated IoT platform adoption. --Normalized FCF to adjusted debt sustained below 10%, likely driven by pricing pressures in data center markets from competing technologies or architectures or increased buying power of CSPs. Developments that May Collectively Lead to Positive Rating Action --Management's commitment to moderate shareholder returns to maintain total leverage below 1x. -Intel expands sustainable and profitable share leadership in data-centric markets, despite intensifying competition from alternate architectures. --Significant disruption by Intel's non-volatile memory and solid adoption of Intel's IoT platform, resulting in further diversification of Intel's sales mix and profit pools LIQUIDITY Solid liquidity. Liquidity was solid at Sept. 30, 2017 and consisted of: i) $17.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and trading assets, of which $10 billion was outside the U.S. and ii) an up to $10 billion commercial paper (CP) program, none of which was outstanding at quarter end. Intel does not have a revolving credit facility to support its CP program, but Fitch views the company's cash flow profile as providing ample support for the program, particularly given Fitch's expectation for only moderate use. Fitch's expectations for more than $3.5 billion on average of annual FCF also support liquidity.

154,INTC,Design flaw found in Intel chips; fix causes them to slow -report,"* Flaw affects kernel memory of processors made in last decade * Patch causes Linux, Windows systems to slow - report * AMD says its chips not affected by the flaw * Intel shares fall 3 pct; AMD up 7 pct in pre-market trade FRANKFURT, Jan 3 (Reuters) - A design flaw has been found in microprocessors made by Intel Corp that requires updates to computer operating systems, a tech publication reported, adding that the fix causes the chips to operate more slowly. The defect affects the so-called kernel memory on Intel processor chips manufactured over the past decade, The Register reported, citing unnamed programmers, and the flaw allows users of normal applications to discern the layout or content of protected areas on the chips. That could make it possible for hackers to exploit other security bugs or, worse, expose secure information such as passwords, thus compromising individual computers or even entire server networks. Intel and Microsoft did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment sent during European working hours. Shares in Intel fell by more than 3 percent in pre-market trading following the report. The Register said programmers for the Linux open-source operating system were working to overhaul the affected memory areas, while Microsoft Corp was expected to issue a Windows patch next Tuesday after circulating test fixes towards the end of 2017. ""Crucially, these updates to both Linux and Windows will incur a performance hit on Intel products,"" The Register wrote (bit.ly/2CsRxkj). “The effects are being benchmarked, however we are looking at a ballpark figure of a five to 30 percent slowdown, depending on the task and the processor model.” Competing chip maker AMD has told Linux developers by email that its chips are not vulnerable to the types of attacks that the fix for the Intel chip is intended to address by isolating the kernel memory, The Register said. Shares in AMD jumped more than 7 percent in premarket trade after The Register report on Intel. Further, the bug is likely to affect major cloud computing platforms such as Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure and Google Compute Engine, according to one software blogger cited by The Register. Microsoft Azure is due to undergo a maintenance reboot on Jan. 10 while Amazon Web Services has also advised customers via email to expect a major security update this Friday. The Register also said that similar operating systems, such as Apple’s 64-bit macOS operating system, would need to be updated.

156,INTC,UPDATE 4-Intel shares fall as investors worry about costs of chip flaw,"(Reuters. - Intel Corp shares fell nearly 2 percent on Thursday as investors worried about the potential financial liability and reputational hit from recently disclosed security flaws in its widely used microprocessors.  The largest chipmaker had confirmed on Wednesday that flaws reported by researchers could allow hackers to steal sensitive information from computers, phones and other devices. Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp and other software makers have issued patches to protect against the vulnerabilities. Intel may be on the hook for costs stemming from lawsuits claiming that the patches would slow computers and effectively force consumers to buy new hardware, and big customers will likely seek compensation from Intel for any software or hardware fixes they make, security experts said.  “The potential liability is big for Intel,” said Eric Johnson, dean of Vanderbilt University’s Owen Graduate School of Management. “Everybody will be scrambling over the next few days to figure out just how big it is.”  Intel has said that the patches for the bugs would slow its chips down somewhat but that most users will not notice.  Amazon Web Services (AWS), the largest seller of cloud computing services, said in a statement it does not “expect meaningful performance impact for most customer workloads.” Microsoft and Alphabet Inc’s Google both said in statements on their websites that they expect few performance problems for most of their cloud computing customers. But the incident is likely to spur cloud companies to press Intel for lower prices on chips in future talks, said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh, which owns shares in Intel.  “What (Intel’s cloud customers) are going to say is, ‘You wronged us, we hate you, but if we can get a discount, we’ll still buy from you,’”  Forrest said.  Forrest also expects Intel will have to increase its chip development spending to focus on security.  Government agencies and security experts said they knew of no cyber attacks that had exploited the vulnerabilities. Financial services firms were studying information on the vulnerabilities to determine how to best respond, said the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a global industry group known as FS-ISAC that shares data on cyber threats. Banks and other firms are trying to understand what it will cost to respond to the issue, FS-ISAC said in an emailed statement. “In addition to the security considerations raised by this design flaw, performance degradation is expected, which could require more processing power for affected systems to compensate and maintain current baseline performance,” FS-ISAC said. “There will need to be consideration and balance between fixing the potential security threat vs the performance and other possible impact to systems.”  Lawyers filed a lawsuit in San Jose, California, federal court on Wednesday that sought class action status and compensation for people who had bought vulnerable Intel chips or computers that came with them already installed.  Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday about the lawsuit.  While more lawsuits are expected, Intel’s biggest customers are likely to quietly seek compensation for any harm caused by the vulnerabilities, including costs to patch machines or replace microprocessors, Johnson said. Legal experts said that consumers would have to prove concrete damages and harm to proceed with claims.  Intel shares fell 1.8 percent, following a 3.4 percent decline Wednesday.  Shares in rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc climbed 4.9 percent as investors speculated the No. 2 maker of microprocessors would woo customers away from Intel.  Still, researchers had said some of AMD’s chips had one of the two vulnerabilities disclosed on Wednesday, as do processors from ARM Holdings.

Germany’s premium automakers BMW (BMWG.DE), Daimler (DAIGn.DE) and Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) Audi (NSUG.DE) bought HERE for 2.8 billion euros ($3.4 billion) in 2015 from Finnish telecoms group Nokia NOK1V.HE. They now hold 74 percent. The automakers wanted to avoid becoming dependent on third-party mapping providers such as Alphabet’s (GOOGL.O) Google, a competitor in the race to develop self-driving cars. Chip maker Intel (INTC.O) also holds a 15 percent stake in HERE. Continental and privately owned Bosch said separately they wanted to advance their expertise in driver-assistance and other data-based technologies. Carmakers are spending billions on developing electric vehicles and software-based mobility services as tougher emission rules, a shift toward shared mobility and connectivity are transforming the auto industry. “Our vision for HERE is to enable an autonomous world for everyone,” said HERE Chief Executive Edzard Overbeek. “To achieve this you need strong partners that complement each other in different areas.” Continental said it would sign a collaboration agreement with Dutch HERE and also seek to jointly develop a high-definition live map for autonomous cars. Software and electronics products are the biggest drivers of growth at Hanover-based Continental which also makes fuel-injection systems and vehicle tyres. It plans to boost total sales to more than 50 billion euros by 2020 from 40.5 billion in 2016. “By leveraging HERE’s technology, we look forward to generating further profitable growth in mobility services and automated driving,” Chief Executive Elmar Degenhart said. Continental shares were up 0.7 percent at 231.30 euros at 1308 GMT. A spokesman for Amsterdam-based HERE, which employs 8,000 staff in 54 countries, said it was possible that more investors will buy into the company in which Japanese electronics firm Pioneer (6773.T) has a stake of less than one percent. A group of investors led by Chinese mapping firm Navinfo (002405.SZ) and internet giant Tencent (0700.HK) had to abandon a plan in September to buy 10 percent of HERE, after failing to win U.S. approval. Bosch’s statement on Thursday referred to plans by HERE to increase its diversification into non-automotive applications - a move that could help to offset risks surrounding the eventual arrival of fully autonomous cars for the mass market. “Bosch is more than cars,” Chief Executive Volkmar Denner said in the statement. He said the company saw synergies with data-based services for smart homes and smart cities - terms broadly describing the use of technology to find efficiencies everywhere from the factory floor to road traffic management.

160,INTC,"Security flaws put virtually all phones, computers at risk","FRANKFURT/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Security researchers on Wednesday disclosed a set of security flaws that they said could let hackers steal sensitive information from nearly every modern computing device containing chips from Intel Corp, Advanced Micro Devices Inc and ARM Holdings. One of the bugs is specific to Intel but another affects laptops, desktop computers, smartphones, tablets and internet servers alike. Intel and ARM insisted that the issue was not a design flaw, but it will require users to download a patch and update their operating system to fix. “Phones, PCs, everything are going to have some impact, but it’ll vary from product to product,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in an interview with CNBC Wednesday afternoon.  Researchers with Alphabet Inc’s Google Project Zero, in conjunction with academic and industry researchers from several countries, discovered two flaws. The first, called Meltdown, affects Intel chips and lets hackers bypass the hardware barrier between applications run by users and the computer’s memory, potentially letting hackers read a computer’s memory and steal passwords. The second, called Spectre, affects chips from Intel, AMD and ARM and lets hackers potentially trick otherwise error-free applications into giving up secret information. The researchers said Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp had patches ready for users for desktop computers affected by Meltdown. Microsoft declined to comment and Apple did not immediately return requests for comment. Daniel Gruss, one of the researchers at Graz University of Technology who discovered Meltdown, called it “probably one of the worst CPU bugs ever found” in an interview with Reuters. Gruss said Meltdown was the more serious problem in the short term but could be decisively stopped with software patches. Spectre, the broader bug that applies to nearly all computing devices, is harder for hackers to take advantage of but less easily patched and will be a bigger problem in the long term, he said. Speaking on CNBC, Intel’s Krzanich said Google researchers told Intel of the flaws “a while ago” and that Intel had been testing fixes that device makers who use its chips will push out next week. Before the problems became public, Google on its blog said Intel and others planned to disclose the issues on Jan. 9. Google said it informed the affected companies about the “Spectre” flaw on June 1, 2017 and reported the “Meltdown” flaw after the first flaw but before July 28, 2017. The flaws were first reported by tech publication The Register. It also reported that the updates to fix the problems could causes Intel chips to operate 5 percent to 30 percent more slowly. (bit.ly/2CsRxkj) Intel denied that the patches would bog down computers based on Intel chips. “Intel has begun providing software and firmware updates to mitigate these exploits,” Intel said in a statement. “Contrary to some reports, any performance impacts are workload-dependent, and, for the average computer user, should not be significant and will be mitigated over time.” ARM spokesman Phil Hughes said that patches had already been shared with the companies’ partners, which include many smartphone manufacturers. “This method only works if a certain type of malicious code is already running on a device and could at worst result in small pieces of data being accessed from privileged memory,” Hughes said in an email. AMD chips are also affected by at least one variant of a set of security flaws but that it can be patched with a software update. The company said it believes there “is near zero risk to AMD products at this time.” Google said in a blog post that Android phones running the latest security updates are protected, as are its own Nexus and Pixel phones with the latest security updates. Gmail users do not need to take any additional action to protect themselves, but users of its Chromebooks, Chrome web browser and many of its Google Cloud services will need to install updates. Amazon Web Services, a cloud computing service used by businesses, said that most of its internet servers were already patched and the rest were in the process of being patched. The defect affects the so-called kernel memory on Intel x86 processor chips manufactured over the past decade, The Register reported citing unnamed programmers, allowing users of normal applications to discern the layout or content of protected areas on the chips. That could make it possible for hackers to exploit other security bugs or, worse, expose secure information such as passwords, thus compromising individual computers or even entire server networks. Dan Guido, chief executive of cyber security consulting firm Trail of Bits, said that businesses should quickly move to update vulnerable systems, saying he expects hackers to quickly develop code they can use to launch attacks that exploit the vulnerabilities. “Exploits for these bugs will be added to hacker’s standard toolkits,” said Guido. Shares in Intel were down by 3.4 percent following the report but nudged back up 1.2 percent to $44.70 in after-hours trading while shares in AMD were up 1 percent to $11.77, shedding many of the gains they had made earlier in the day when reports suggested its chips were not affected. It was not immediately clear whether Intel would face any significant financial liability arising from the reported flaw. “The current Intel problem, if true, would likely not require CPU replacement in our opinion. However the situation is fluid,” Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities in New York said in a note, adding it could hurt the company’s reputation.

164,INTC,Intel shares fall as investors worry about costs of chip flaw,"(Reuters. - Intel Corp shares fell nearly 2 percent on Thursday as investors worried about the potential financial liability and reputational hit from recently disclosed security flaws in its widely used microprocessors.  The largest chipmaker had confirmed on Wednesday that flaws reported by researchers could allow hackers to steal sensitive information from computers, phones and other devices. Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp and other software makers have issued patches to protect against the vulnerabilities. Intel may be on the hook for costs stemming from lawsuits claiming that the patches would slow computers and effectively force consumers to buy new hardware, and big customers will likely seek compensation from Intel for any software or hardware fixes they make, security experts said.  “The potential liability is big for Intel,” said Eric Johnson, dean of Vanderbilt University’s Owen Graduate School of Management. “Everybody will be scrambling over the next few days to figure out just how big it is.”  Intel has said that the patches for the bugs would slow its chips down somewhat but that most users will not notice.  Amazon Web Services (AWS), the largest seller of cloud computing services, said in a statement it does not “expect meaningful performance impact for most customer workloads.” Microsoft and Alphabet Inc’s Google both said in statements on their websites that they expect few performance problems for most of their cloud computing customers. But the incident is likely to spur cloud companies to press Intel for lower prices on chips in future talks, said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh, which owns shares in Intel.  “What (Intel’s cloud customers) are going to say is, ‘You wronged us, we hate you, but if we can get a discount, we’ll still buy from you,’”  Forrest said.  Forrest also expects Intel will have to increase its chip development spending to focus on security.  Government agencies and security experts said they knew of no cyber attacks that had exploited the vulnerabilities. Financial services firms were studying information on the vulnerabilities to determine how to best respond, said the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a global industry group known as FS-ISAC that shares data on cyber threats. Banks and other firms are trying to understand what it will cost to respond to the issue, FS-ISAC said in an emailed statement. “In addition to the security considerations raised by this design flaw, performance degradation is expected, which could require more processing power for affected systems to compensate and maintain current baseline performance,” FS-ISAC said. “There will need to be consideration and balance between fixing the potential security threat vs the performance and other possible impact to systems.”  Lawyers filed a lawsuit in San Jose, California, federal court on Wednesday that sought class action status and compensation for people who had bought vulnerable Intel chips or computers that came with them already installed.  Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday about the lawsuit.  While more lawsuits are expected, Intel’s biggest customers are likely to quietly seek compensation for any harm caused by the vulnerabilities, including costs to patch machines or replace microprocessors, Johnson said. Legal experts said that consumers would have to prove concrete damages and harm to proceed with claims.  Intel shares fell 1.8 percent, following a 3.4 percent decline Wednesday.  Shares in rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc climbed 4.9 percent as investors speculated the No. 2 maker of microprocessors would woo customers away from Intel.  Still, researchers had said some of AMD’s chips had one of the two vulnerabilities disclosed on Wednesday, as do processors from ARM Holdings.

166,INTC,"WRAPUP-Apple, researchers eye patches to solve Intel chip flaws","* Tech companies say security patches not slowing processors * CERT researchers back down on need for mass chip replacement * Intel shares sank on Tues/Wed on fears of exposure By Kanishka Singh and Douglas Busvine FRANKFURT/BENGALURU, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Security issues with Intel Corp microchips are only slowing computers slightly, technology companies said, as researchers played down the need for mass hardware replacements to protect millions of devices from hackers. Google and other security researchers this week disclosed two major chip flaws - one called Meltdown affecting only Intel Corp chips and one called Spectre affecting nearly all computer chips made in the last decade. That raised the prospect of Intel being on the hook for lawsuits claiming that software patches to fix the issue would slow computers and effectively force consumers to buy new hardware, driving the company’s shares down. But Intel said in a statement after U.S. stock markets closed on Thursday that the performance impact of the recent security updates should not be significant and would be mitigated over time. It said Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Google and Microsoft Corp had all reported little to no performance impact from security patches. intel.ly/2CHQ89E “Intel continues to believe that the performance impact of these updates is highly workload-dependent and, for the average computer user, should not be significant,” it said. The company confirmed that the flaws reported by the researchers could allow hackers to steal information from computers, phones and other devices, but insisted that the issue was not a design flaw. The chipmaker said it would require users to download a patch and update their operating system to fix the issue. Microsoft and Google have said they expect few performance problems for most of their cloud computing customers. Apple said in a separate statement late on Thursday that its tests showed patches would not significantly affect processing speeds. “Our testing with public benchmarks has shown that the changes in the December 2017 updates resulted in no measurable reduction in the performance of macOS and iOS ... or in common Web browsing benchmarks,” the California-based firm said. CERT, the cyber security project at Carnegie Mellon University sponsored by the U.S. government, on Friday withdrew its recommendation for the replacement of the central processing units (CPUs) of affected systems. In the updated guidance, CERT said “operating system and some application updates mitigate these attacks”. Daniel Gruss, the 31-year-old information security researcher and post-doctoral fellow at Austria’s Graz Technical University who discovered the Meltdown flaw, welcomed Intel’s white paper on the issue. “This looks much more professional now,” Gruss said in comments emailed to Reuters. On the change in recommendation from CERT, Gruss said, however, that there were no replacements yet that could address the flaws in processors that he and other researchers have found. “All CPUs are affected, also very recent ones,” Gruss said. “Furthermore, software updates can fix most of the problems, leaving only a small remaining attack surface.” Browser makers Google, Microsoft Corp and Mozilla Corp’s Firefox confirmed to Reuters on Thursday that the patches they currently have in place do not protect iOS users. With Safari and virtually all other popular browsers not patched, hundreds of millions of iPhone and iPad users may not have secure means of web browsing until Apple issues its patch. Apple said it would release a patch for the Safari web browser on its devices within days. It said that there were no known instances of hackers taking advantage of the flaw to date.

170,INTC,WRAPUP 3-Businesses cautious in installing patches to fix chip flaw,"(Reuters) - Chances that a fix to a major microchip security flaw may slow down or crash some computer systems are leading some businesses to hold off installing software patches, fearing the cure may be worse than the original problem. Researchers this week revealed security problems with chips from Intel Corp (INTC.O) and many of its rivals, sending businesses, governments and consumers scrambling to understand the extent of the threat and the cost of fixes.  Rather than rushing to put on patches, a costly and time-intensive endeavor for major systems, some businesses are testing the fix, leaving their machines vulnerable. “If you start applying patches across your whole fleet without doing proper testing, you could cause systems to crash, essentially putting all of your employees out of work,” said Ben Johnson, co-founder of cyber-security startup Obsidian. Banks and other financial institutions spent much of the week studying the vulnerabilities, said Greg Temm, chief information risk officer with the Financial Services Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, an industry group that shares data on emerging cyber threats. The flaws affect virtually all computers and mobile devices, but are not considered “critical” because there is no evidence that hackers have figured out how to exploit them, said Temm, whose group works with many of the world’s largest banks. “It’s like getting a diagnosis of high blood pressure, but not having a cardiac arrest,” Temm said. “We’re taking it seriously, but it’s not something that is killing us.”  Banks are testing the patches to see if they slow operations and, if so, what changes need to be made, Temm said. For instance, computers could be added to networks to make up for the lack of processor speed in individual machines, he added. Some popular antivirus software programs are incompatible with the software updates, causing desktop and laptop computers to freeze up and show a “blue screen of death,” researcher Johnson said. Antivirus software makers responded by rolling out fixes to make their products compatible with the updated operating systems, he said. In a blog posting on Friday, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said it would only offer security patches to Windows customers whose antivirus software suppliers had confirmed with Microsoft that the patch would not crash the customer’s machine. “If you have not been offered the security update, you may be running incompatible antivirus software, and you should consult the software vendor,” Microsoft advised in the blog post. Government agencies also are watching. The Ohio Attorney General’s office is monitoring the situation, a spokesman said by email. “Intel continues to believe that the performance impact of these updates is highly workload-dependent and, for the average computer user, should not be significant and will be mitigated over time,” the world’s No. 1 chipmaker said on Thursday in a release. It cited Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft as saying that most users had seen no significant impact on performance after installing the patches. The cloud vendors are among a group of firms that quickly patched their technology to mitigate against the threat from one of those vulnerabilities, dubbed Meltdown, which only affects machines running Intel chips. Major software makers have not issued patches to protect against the second vulnerability, dubbed Spectre, which affects nearly all computer chips made in the last decade, including those from Intel, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O), and ARM-architecture manufacturers, including Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O). However, Google, Firefox and Microsoft have implemented measures in most web browsers to stop hackers from launching remote attacks using Spectre. Governments and security experts say they have seen no cyber attacks seeking to exploit either vulnerability, though they expect attempts by hackers as they digest technical data about the security flaws. One key risk is that hackers will develop code that can infect the personal computers of people visiting malicious websites, said Chris Wysopal, chief technology officer of cyber security firm Veracode. He advised PC owners to install the patches to protect against such potential attacks. Computer servers at large enterprises are less at risk, he said, because those systems are not used to surf the web and can only be infected in a Meltdown attack if a hacker has already breached that network.  Microsoft has issued a patch for its Windows operating system, and Apple desktop users with the most recent operating system are protected. Google has said most of its Chromebook laptops are already protected and that the rest would be soon. Apple said it planned to release a patch to its Safari web browser within coming days to protect Mac and iOS users from Spectre.  While third-party browsers from Google and others can protect Mac users from Spectre, all major web browsers for Apple’s iOS devices depend on receiving a patch from Apple. Until then, hundreds of millions of iPhone and iPad users will be exposed to potential Spectre attacks while browsing the Web.

182,INTC,Cloud companies consider Intel rivals after security flaws found,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Some of Intel Corp’s (INTC.O) data center customers, whose thousands of computers run cloud networks, are exploring using microchips from the market leader’s rivals to build new infrastructure after the discovery of security flaws affecting most chips. Whether Intel sees a slew of defectors or is forced to offer discounts, the company could take a hit to one of its fastest growing business units. Intel chips back 98 percent of data center operations, according to industry consultancy IDC. Security researchers last week disclosed flaws, dubbed Meltdown and Spectre, that could allow hackers to steal passwords or encryption keys on most types of computers, phones and cloud-based servers. Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on Tuesday the patches necessary to secure the threats could have a significant performance impact on servers. Intel will help customers find the best approach in terms of security, performance and compatibility, it said in a statement on Tuesday. “For many customers, the performance element is foremost, and we are sharply focused on doing all we can to ensure that we meet their expectations.” Alternatives include Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), which shares with Intel a chip architecture called x86, or chips based on technology from ARM Holdings or graphics processing chips, which were developed for different tasks than Intel and AMD’s central processing units, or CPUs. For Gleb Budman’s company, San Mateo-based online storage firm Backblaze, building with ARM chips would not be difficult. “If ARM provides enough computing power at lower cost or lower power than x86, it would be a strong incentive for us to switch,” said Budman. “If the fix for x86 results in a dramatically decreased level of performance, that might increasingly push in favor of switching to ARM.” Infinitely Virtual, a Los Angeles-based cloud computing vendor, is counting on Intel to replace equipment or offer a rebate to make up for the loss in computing power, Chief Executive Adam Stern said in an interview. “If Intel doesn’t step up and do something to make this right then we’re going to have to punish them in the marketplace by not purchasing their products,” said Stern, whose company relies exclusively on Intel processors. Cloud providers said swapping out previously installed Intel chips for rivals’ would be too complex, but moving forward they could expand their networks using alternatives. Moving from Intel to AMD is easiest since AMD and Intel chips share a common core technology called the x86 instruction set, they said. ARM-based chips lag the speed of Intel’s x86 based chips for tasks such as searches, and software would have to be rewritten. Nvidia Corp’s (NVDA.O) so-called graphical processing units, or GPUs, are not a direct replacement for Intel’s CPUs, but they are taking over the CPU’s role for new types of work like image recognition and speech recognition.  Major technology companies had been experimenting with Intel alternatives even before the security flaws were revealed.  Last March, Microsoft committed to using ARM processors for its Azure cloud service, and in December, Microsoft Azure deployed Advanced Micro Devices processors in its data centers. Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google said in 2016 that it was designing a server based on International Business Machines Corp’s (IBM.N) Power9 processor. And Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) Amazon Web Services chose AMD graphics processing units for a graphics design service announced in September. Both Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) and Cavium Inc CAVM.O are developing ARM chips aimed at data centers. Cavium said it aimed to rival the performance of Intel chips for applications like databases and the content-delivery networks that help speed things like how fast online videos load. Cavium is working with Microsoft and “several other cloud” vendors, said Gopal Hegde, vice president of the data center processor group. Cavium and ARM rival Qualcomm work together to reduce the amount of software that has to be rewritten for ARM chips. Cloudflare, a San Francisco cloud network company, has been evaluating ARM chips. The new security patches have not slowed its performance, but it will use the security issues as an opportunity to re-evaluate its use of Intel products, said Chief Technology Officer John Graham Cumming.

185,INTC,"UPDATE 5-Nvidia updates software, says graphic chips not hit by flaws","(Reuters) - Nvidia Corp is updating the software for its graphics processors in response to the Spectre security threat, but its chief executive said on Wednesday its chips were not subject to the same risks as those from Intel and other companies. “Our GPUs are immune,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during an event at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, referring to graphics processing units, the chip maker’s key product.  “They are not affected by these security issues.” Huang’s comments illustrate how technology sellers from cloud-based datacenter providers to anti-virus companies are scrambling to guard against flaws disclosed last week in chips made by Intel and others.  Security researchers revealed vulnerabilities, dubbed Meltdown and Spectre, that could let hackers steal passwords or encryption keys from central processing units (CPUs) made by Intel and rivals. CPUs are used on personal computers, smartphones, servers and other devices. The security patches unveiled by Nvidia relate to software drivers that let its chips work with operating systems like Windows. While Nvidia said its GPUs are not flawed, it was updating its drivers because they interact with potentially vulnerable CPUs. It said it had no reason to believe the drivers were  troubled by the second flaw, dubbed Meltdown. (bit.ly/2DeYzXN) Intel published data that showed that the recent security updates did not have significant performance impact.  The data included three generations of processor platforms running Microsoft Corp's Windows 10 and Windows 7 operating systems, Intel Vice President Navin Shenoy said.   (intel.ly/2qRnn5x) While the full extent of devices affected by the flaws is not yet fully known, Cisco Systems Inc has said it has identified 18 vulnerable products and is looking for problems in nearly 30 other products, including switches and routers. Advanced Micro Devices Inc and Softbank’s ARM Holdings have said their central processing units are potentially exposed to Spectre. Advanced Micro also makes graphics chips. Intel has been hit by both Spectre and Meltdown and shares in all three chipmakers have been pushed around by the issues. Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann said Nvidia’s driver updates could become a problem for data centers and lead corporate customers to hold off on buying servers which have GPUs. “This can end up being a potential issue in data centers and enterprise customers can take a pause in buying the servers,” he said. Intel and AMD have not disclosed the number of chips affected by the security flaws and AMD has said its products were at “zero risk” from Meltdown. ARM says around 5 percent of more than 120 billion chips using its designs shipped since 1991 were impacted by Spectre, and significantly fewer by Meltdown. Nvidia shares, down more than 1 percent in early trade, bounced back to gain 0.8 percent on the day after Huang’s comments. Intel shares fell 2.5 percent, while AMD, which investors speculate will benefit from its rivals’ problems, gained 1.2 percent.

Intel confirmed that patches for the security flaws can cause higher-than-expected reboot rates in Ivy Bridge, Sandy Bridge, Skylake and Kaby Lake processors, said Navin Shenoy, general manager of the data center group, in a statement on Intel’s website. The Kaby Lake chips are the company’s most recent offering. Last week, Intel said it had received reports that its security patches were causing problems in systems with its older Broadwell and Haswell chips. Shenoy said that Intel had issued patches for 90 percent of Intel chips released in the past five years but that the company had “more work to do.” He also said the company would send out initial versions of fixes for the buggy patches to customers by next week. “We have reproduced these issues internally and are making progress toward identifying the root cause,” Shenoy wrote.     On Jan. 3 Intel confirmed that the Spectre and Meltdown  flaws affected its chips, potentially letting hackers steal information believed to be very secure. The Spectre flaw affected nearly every modern computing device, including those with chips from Intel, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) and ARM Holdings.  Intel on Wednesday also quantified how much of a performance hit the patches cause for data center customers. For common tasks such as running website servers, the patches caused a 2 percent slowdown, Intel said. Another test that simulated online transactions at a stock brokerage showed a 4 percent slowdown, the company said. For some types for work involving servers that store large amounts of data and try to retrieve it quickly, the company said the slowdown could be as severe as 18 percent to 25 percent.

200,INTC,FTC investigating Broadcom for antitrust practices,"(Reuters) - The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is investigating whether chipmaker Broadcom Ltd engaged in anticompetitive tactics in negotiations with customers, the company said on Wednesday. The investigation comes as Broadcom pursues a hostile takeover of Qualcomm  in a $103 billion deal. Since the FTC would likely review any merger for anticompetitive practices, the current probe could make regulatory approval more challenging.  Broadcom was recently issued subpoenas that seek an extensive amount of information, according to the Wall Street Journal, which was the first to report the probe on Wednesday. The focus of the concern has been that Broadcom has changed some contracts to require customers to buy a percentage of its production of items rather than a certain number, the paper reported. “This FTC review is immaterial to our business, does not relate to wireless and has no impact on our proposal to acquire Qualcomm,” Broadcom said in a statement. Broadcom shares were up slightly on Wednesday afternoon, trading at $265.81. The FTC, which investigates actions that might break antitrust law, declined to comment. Chipmaker Qualcomm is fending off a takeover bid by Broadcom. In November, it rejected Broadcom’s $103 billion cash-and-stock bid, saying it dramatically undervalued the company. In December, Qualcomm rejected Broadcom’s 11 director nominees. U.S. antitrust regulators will likely take a close look at any deal since a combined Broadcom-Qualcomm would become the dominant supplier of chips used in the 1.5 billion or so smartphones expected to be sold around the world. It would raise the stakes for Intel Corp , which has been diversifying from its stronghold in computers into smartphone technology by supplying modem chips to Apple Inc .

201,INTC,Intel asks customers to stop using faulty patches,"Jan 22 (Reuters) - Intel Corp has asked computer makers to stop rolling out a set of faulty patches it issued to fix security flaws in its chips and instead start testing an updated version. The company said on Monday that it wanted computer manufacturers and data center owners to stop using the current fixes for the so-called Meltdown and Spectre security flaws, which can let hackers steal sensitive information from computers made with its processors. The patches, which the company spent months crafting, cause computers to reboot more often than normal. Instead, Intel asked customers to start testing an updated version of its patches that it began sending out on Saturday and Sunday. Intel also said it had identified the root cause of the reboot problem in its older Broadwell and Haswell processors. “We ask that our industry partners focus efforts on testing early versions of the updated solution so we can accelerate its release,” Navin Shenoy, general manager of Intel’s data center group, said in a posting on the company’s website. “I apologize for any disruption this change in guidance may cause.” On Jan. 3 Intel confirmed that Spectre and Meltdown affected its chips. Meltdown was specific to chips from Intel, as well as one from Softbank Group Corp’s ARM Holdings. Spectre affected nearly every modern computing device, including those with chips from those companies and Advanced Micro Devices Inc . As Intel began to roll out patches for the flaws, problems cropped up. On Jan. 11, Intel acknowledged that the patches were causing higher reboot rates in its older chips. Last week, Intel said the problem also affected its most recent Ivy Bridge, Sandy Bridge, Skylake and Kaby Lake processors.

Intel Executive Vice President Navin Shenoy disclosed the problem in a statement on the chipmaker's website, saying that patches released after months of development caused computers to reboot more often than normal and other ""unpredictable"" behavior. (intel.ly/2DsL9qz) “I apologize for any disruption this change in guidance may cause,” Shenoy said. “I assure you we are working around the clock to ensure we are addressing these issues.” The issue of the faulty patches is separate from complaints by customers for weeks that the patches slow computer performance. Intel has said a typical home and business PC user should not see significant slowdowns. Intel’s failure to provide a usable patch could cause businesses to postpone purchasing new computers, said IDC analyst Mario Morales.  Intel is “still trying to get a handle on what’s really happening. They haven’t resolved the matter,” he said. Intel asked technology providers to start testing a new version of the patches, which it began distributing on Saturday.  The warning came nearly three weeks after Intel confirmed on Jan. 3 that its chips were impacted by vulnerabilities known as Spectre and Meltdown, which make data on affected computers vulnerable to espionage.  Meltdown was specific to chips from Intel, as well as one from SoftBank Group Corp’s (9984.T) ARM Holdings. Spectre affected nearly every modern computing device, including ones with chips from Intel, ARM and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O). Problems with the patches have been growing since Intel on Jan. 11 said they were causing higher reboot rates in its older chips and then last week that the problem was affecting newer processors.  The Wall Street Journal first reported Intel asking customers to halt using the patches.

204,INTC,"UPDATE 4-Intel data center sales surge, warns of potential security flaw fallout","(Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) on Thursday gave a bullish forecast and blew past Wall Street expectations for the fourth quarter on the strength of data center sales, the business it sees as key to its transformation from a PC supplier. Intel stock rose 3.8 percent to $47.06, boosted by a 10 percent dividend hike and the forecast, which signaled that Intel is succeeding in containing fallout from recently disclosed security flaws that could allow hackers to steal data from computers. Those flaws, dubbed Spectre and Meltdown, created global concern among technology users, and Intel acknowledged on Thursday, for the first time, that the fallout could hurt future results. But Intel executives consistently indicated that they did not expect that to happen. Software fixes for the problems would be succeeded by solutions designed into Intel chips themselves later this year, Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on a conference call. In an interview ahead of Intel’s earnings call with investors, Chief Financial Officer Bob Swan said the company sees no “meaningful impact” on corporate earnings from the vulnerabilities. “They had all these bullets flying at them with these chip flaws, but when I look at these numbers, it’s a blowout across all metrics,” said Daniel Morgan, a fund manager with Synovus Trust, which holds Intel shares. “That makes it a bulletproof quarter.” Revenue from the company’s higher-margin data center business rose about 20 percent to $5.58 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $5.13 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Investors had targeted 10 percent growth, said Kevin Cassidy, an analyst at Stifel. “Data center group is one of the key metrics we are watching. It’s certainly a positive to see that turn up,” said Peter Karazeris, an analyst Intel investor Thrivent Financial. Revenue from Intel’s PC group hit $9 billion for the quarter, a 2 percent decline from the year before, but ticked up 3 percent for the year to $34 billion. Intel also saw strong growth in two small non-PC businesses that it hopes to expand in the future. Its so-called internet of things business, which focuses on connecting street lights and industrial machines to the web, expanded 21 percent to $879 million for the quarter. Programmable chips, which customers like Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) are experimenting with using in data centers, grew 35 percent to $568 million for the quarter. Intel predicted $65 billion in revenue for 2018, well above expectations of a $63.7 billion forecast. The company also said its tax rate would be 14 percent for 2018 after changes in U.S. tax law that it executives said created a “level playing field” for U.S. manufacturers. Intel warned in its earnings release that fallout from the discovery of Spectre and Meltdown could hurt future results, as well as customer relationships and the company’s reputation.  Analysts have said the biggest risk to Intel might come from customers using the disruption caused by fixing the bug as an excuse to press for lower prices.  The company posted a loss of $687 million, or 15 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 30, including a $5.4 billion charge related to recent changes in U.S. tax law. Excluding items, the chipmaker earned $1.08 per share for the fourth quarter, up 39 percent from 79 cents a year earlier. Total revenue for the quarter rose 4.1 percent to $17.1 billion, up from $16.4 billion a year earlier. Those figures beat analysts’ expectations of a profit of 86 cents per share on a revenue of $16.34 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

209,INTC,Wall Street to grill Intel on chip security flaws,"(Reuters) - Wall Street analysts will grill Intel Corp (INTC.O) executives on how massive security flaws in its computer chips are impacting business when the company reports quarterly results on Thursday. Intel has said there would be no material cost to it from security flaws, dubbed Meltdown and Spectre, that were disclosed on Jan. 3 since both could be solved with software. But the real-world effects on productivity are still being determined. “As an investor you want to know what’s going to happen in the future and how it’s going to impact their margins,” said     Kim Forrest, a portfolio manager with Fort Pitt Capital Group, which holds about 728,000 Intel shares. She wants more information about Intel’s plans for a long-term fix to the problem, including details on cost and how the changes might affect chip performance. An Intel spokeswoman declined to discuss the results ahead of their release. Intel has stumbled in its response to the flaws, asking customers to stop using some patches which themselves have bugs. Customers might use the flaws and Intel’s response as a negotiating point to seek discounts, which could pressure Intel’s operating income. Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist with Inverness Counsel, says his firm will avoid adding Intel to its $2.8 billion portfolio until more details emerge on how Intel will address the flaws. “What we really need is transparency,” said Ghriskey, who said the issue could cause Intel to miss future revenue or profit targets.  It’s still not clear how long it will take to resolve the problem, said Daniel Ives, head of technology research with GBH Insights. “Investors have handicapped that it’s going to be negligible damage,” Ives said. “How they handle this over the next few months will dictate whether there is any long-term damage.” Wall Street analysts have said they are comfortable with Intel’s assessment that the flaws will not derail earnings.  “I don’t think the financial impact is going to be that material,” Joseph Gunnar & Co analyst Ashok Kumar told Reuters. Baird Equity Research analyst Tristan Gerra said he expects revenue in Intel’s high-margin data center chip business to grow 7 percent in 2018, the same rate it rose in the third quarter.

211,INTC,SK Hynix fourth-quarter profit rockets to record; chip demand seen surging this year,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea’s SK Hynix capped a record year in profit with a blockbuster fourth quarter and predicted a further surge in demand for memory chips this year, easing market concerns that the chip boom might be over. The stock rose 5 percent on Thursday’s news after sliding about 20 percent since early November amid falling prices for NAND flash memory chips, used in USB drives and mobile phones, a mainstay for the company.  SK Hynix said fourth-quarter operating profit nearly tripled to a record 4.5 trillion won ($4.2 billion), higher than the 4.3 trillion forecast by analysts. Revenue jumped 69 percent to 9 trillion won. That lifted annual earnings to an all-time high of 13.7 trillion won. Demand for more firepower, especially from servers in data centers, are seen driving 2018 profits for the world’s second-biggest memory chip maker after Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, SK Hynix said in a call with analysts and investors. SK Hynix’s rosy outlook boosted investor confidence in the chip sector that had taken a hit after Samsung’s profit guidance earlier this month fell short of analysts’ estimates. This week, Texas Instruments Inc posted its slowest revenue growth in four quarters on softer demand for its chips. “There had been various concerns such as the market slowing, NAND price dropping — but from today’s call, it doesn’t look like a slowdown is happening,” said Lee Seung-woo, an analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities. “There were also worries that the Intel bug issue or the sluggish sale of Apple’s iPhones might hurt memory chip demand, but the company dispelled them,” he said. SK Hynix said it has not detected any slowdown in memory chip demand due to the Intel security issue, for which patches were released to counteract vulnerabilities that slowed some servers. The problem could even increase server demand as it affects high-traffic work that might have to be supplemented by server expansion, the company said. In answer to a question on China’s smartphone makers resisting higher memory chip prices, SK Hynix said low-end smartphones have little room to handle rising memory prices and the firm will consider such matters in pricing, without elaborating. To meet demand, especially from server clients, SK Hynix said it is considering moving up the construction of a new chip production line from year-end as originally planned. However, the new line wasn’t expected to contribute to chip supply this year because of the time it takes to install and test equipment. For the industry as a whole, SK Hynix predicted NAND chip supply would grow in 2018, gradually easing a shortage. Supply of DRAM chips, used in mobile phones, computers and servers, will remain tight due to limited production capacity. The company said that slower sales of some smartphones would have little impact on overall DRAM demand as other phone and PC makers would snap up the chips.  Total memory chip industry revenue in 2017 was a record $132 billion, up from $80 billion in 2016, and is set to rise further to $150 billion in 2018 before falling to about $130 billion in 2019, according to research provider Gartner.

212,INTC,UPDATE 4-SK Hynix Q4 profit rockets to record; chip demand seen surging this year,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea’s SK Hynix capped a record year in profit with a blockbuster fourth quarter and predicted a further surge in demand for memory chips this year, easing market concerns that the chip boom might be over. The stock rose 5 percent on Thursday’s news after sliding about 20 percent since early November amid falling prices for NAND flash memory chips, used in USB drives and mobile phones, a mainstay for the company.  SK Hynix said fourth-quarter operating profit nearly tripled to a record 4.5 trillion won ($4.2 billion), higher than the 4.3 trillion forecast by analysts. Revenue jumped 69 percent to 9 trillion won. That lifted annual earnings to an all-time high of 13.7 trillion won.

Intel’s shares surged about 9 percent to their highest in almost two decades, after results indicated that the chipmaker’s shift to higher-margin data-center business was gaining pace. AbbVie’s shares hit a record after the drugmaker significantly boosted its 2018 earnings forecast. The reports helped investors look beyond data that showed U.S. economic growth unexpectedly slowed in the fourth quarter as strong consumer spending resulted in a surge in imports. Gross domestic product increased at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department said in its advance GDP report. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the economy to expand at a 3 percent rate. “The Q4 print showed that domestic demand is strong – really strong – and perhaps beginning to push against the capacity constraints of the economy,” market economists at BNP Paribas wrote in a note. Another set of data showed new orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly fell in December. Markets have moved this week on comments from top U.S. officials at the World Economic Forum in Davos. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s endorsement of a weak dollar earlier in the week had triggered a slide in the currency. It recouped some of the losses after President Donald Trump said he ultimately wants the dollar to be strong. The dollar was last down 0.46 percent against a basket of currencies. At 12:29 p.m. ET (1729 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 93.42 points, or 0.35 percent, at 26,486.21. The S&P; 500 gained 15.76 points, or 0.56 percent, to 2,855.01. The Nasdaq Composite was up 45.65 points, or 0.62 percent, at 7,456.81. Of the 133 S&P; 500 companies that have reported quarterly earnings so far, 79.7 percent have topped expectations, versus an average of 72 percent over the previous four quarters. The S&P; healthcare index was the biggest gainer among the 11 major S&P; sectors, up 1.3 percent, led by gains in AbbVie, Pfizer and Gilead. Pfizer rose 3.6 percent after European regulator recommended granting marketing approval to a diabetes drug developed by the company and Merck. Gilead Sciences jumped 4.4 percent after broker upgraded to “buy”. Honeywell International rose 1.05 percent after the company raised its forecast for 2018 profit.

221,INTC,Intel shares hit dotcom-era highs after bumper results,"(Reuters) - Intel Corp’s (INTC.O) shares rose 7 percent on Friday to their highest in almost two decades, after strong results offered the clearest sign yet that its years-long effort to shift away from a slowing PC business was paying off. Shares of the company were trading at $48.50 on Friday, adding nearly $15 billion to its market value and hitting highs last seen in September 2000 during the dotcom boom. Investors were also comforted by Intel’s assurances that it does not expect any material impact from the recent disclosure of security flaws Spectre and Meltdown in billions of its chips. The Santa Clara-based company helped found the personal computer industry and became one of the world’s biggest chipmaker on the back of growing demand for PCs. But, in the last few years, falling PC demand has pushed Intel to focus on making chips for data centers to offset revenue loss. Revenue from the company’s higher-margin data center business jumped about 20 percent to $5.58 billion. “Intel is successfully navigating the transition from a PC-centric to data-centric company – specifically, Intel’s data-centric businesses now comprise about 47 percent of revenue,” Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer said. Pitzer upgraded the stock to “outperform” from “neutral.” The business is showing no signs of slowing down - Intel forecast its data centric unit to grow mid-teens and PC centric business in the low single digits this year, projecting overall revenue growth of 4 percent to $65 billion. “While we believe near term PC unit declines have been impacted by a lengthening in the PC refresh cycle, we view this lengthening as slowing over time, lessening the deleterious impact on overall company growth,” Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland said. Analysts said Intel will benefit this year from higher demand for gaming computers, memory chip ramp and increased modem sales to Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) iPhones. Modem sales increased 26 percent year-over-year, which we attribute largely to the iPhone refresh, Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer said.

U.S. Treasury yields recovered from almost four-year highs reached overnight as investors weighed whether a dramatic week-long selloff had run its course. Benchmark 10-year note yield surged to 2.885 percent overnight, the highest since January 2014, but fell back to 2.841 percent in morning trading. Rising bond yields mean higher borrowing cost for companies and an alternative investment option for traders. Wall Street’s three major indexes logged their biggest weekly losses in two years on Friday after a strong payrolls report. The S&P; 500 and the Dow saw their worst weeks since early January 2016 while the Nasdaq recorded its worst week since early Feb 2016. It was also the biggest daily point fall in the Dow since December 2008 during the financial crisis. “I think what’s happening right now can be compared to early 2016 where we saw a pullback that was confidence related rather than fundamental and we saw it reverse fairly quickly,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial. “Seeing the 10-year break multi-year highs and the fact that it happened quickly made the market realize there are some real risks out there.” Shares of Apple rose 1.7 percent and were the biggest boost to all the three major indexes. The tech sector was the biggest gainer with a 0.62 percent rise. At 10:49 a.m. ET (1549 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 14.92 points, or 0.06 percent, at 25,506.04, the S&P; 500 was down 0.24 points, or 0.008 percent, at 2,761.89. The Nasdaq Composite was up 22.22 points, or 0.31 percent, at 7,263.16. Friday’s U.S. payrolls report showed wages growing at their fastest pace in more than eight years, fueling concerns that both inflation and interest rates would rise faster than expected. Currently, traders are pricing in three rate hikes for 2018, but if the economy and corporate earnings continue to improve, the chances of a fourth increase becomes more likely. “I think we could see four rate hikes in 2018 but at the same time you have to look at why they’re raising rates. They’re doing that in response to faster economic growth,” McMillan said. Seven of the 11 major S&P; sectors were lower, with the energy index’s 0.89 percent fall leading the decliners. Wells Fargo fell 7.2 percent after the Fed imposed new regulatory restrictions over compliance issues. Qualcomm fell 2.3 percent after KGI Securities said Apple might drop the chipmaker in favor of Intel as the supplier for modem chips in its next generation of iPhones. Shares of Intel rose 2.3 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,766 to 1,077. On the Nasdaq, 1,648 issues fell and 1,163 advanced.

228,INTC,Qualcomm shares falls as report says Apple will dump chips,"Feb 5 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc shares fell 2 percent on Monday after KGI Securities said Apple Inc might drop the chipmaker in favor of Intel Corp as the supplier for modem chips in its next generation of iPhones. Qualcomm has been a supplier of components to Apple for years but the relationship took a bad turn last year when Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. “There is speculation that Apple might drop Qualcomm altogether for its next generation phones and I think that’s part of the reason the stock is down today,” said Angelo Zino, an analyst from CFRA Research. The report from KGI came as Broadcom Ltd sweetened its bid to buy Qualcomm to more than $121 billion from an earlier $103 billion. According to technology news website 9TO5MAC, KGI said that Intel could meet Apple’s technical requirements and offer more competitive prices. Reuters has not seen the note from KGI, whose Ming-Chi Kuo is among the financial world’s best known Apple analysts. Intel shares were up 1 percent at $46.66.

230,INTC,Intel hit with 32 lawsuits over security flaws,"(Reuters) - Intel Corp said on Friday shareholders and customers had filed 32 class action lawsuits against the company in connection with recently-disclosed security flaws in its microchips. Most of the lawsuits - 30 - are customer class action cases that claim that users were harmed by Intel’s “actions and/or omissions” related to the flaws, which could allow hackers to steal data from computers. Intel said in a regulatory filing it was not able to estimate the potential losses that may arise out of the lawsuits.  Security researchers at the start of January publicized two flaws, dubbed Spectre and Meltdown, that affected nearly every modern computing device containing chips from Intel, Advanced Micro Devices Inc and ARM Holdings. The companies have issued fixes but some patches slowed down computers, leading sector analysts to say producers could potentially face suits from clients and consumers claiming damages because their devices did not work as they should.   The company said the remaining two suits were securities class actions, where the plaintiffs allege that Intel and some of its officers violated securities laws by making statements about products or its internal controls that were later revealed to have been false or misleading. The company’s filing also listed three individual Intel shareholders who had filed actions against members of Intel’s board and other managers, alleging that they failed their duties to Intel by failing to take action in relation to alleged insider trading. It did not specify what allegations of wrongdoing the suit dealt with.  Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich sold 889,879 shares in the company on Nov. 29 as per a trading plan adopted on Oct. 30, making roughly $39 million from the sale, well before the details of the flaw were made public. Bloomberg reported last month that although Intel says Krzanich’s sales were part of a pre-arranged stock plan, securities lawyers believed the larger-than-usual transaction could be examined by the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC). Krzanich said last month that Google researchers told Intel of the flaws “a while ago”.  Google says it informed the affected companies about the Spectre flaw on June 1, 2017 and reported the Meltdown flaw after the first flaw but before July 28, 2017. The two securities-related class action suits were filed by individuals who claim to represent classes of buyers of Intel’s stock between July 27 last year and Jan. 4.

234,INTC,Cisco says most network gear needed for 5G is ready now and can cut costs,"BARCELONA (Reuters) - Cisco Systems (CSCO.O) said on Sunday it aims to disrupt the wireless radio access market led by Huawei HWT.UL, Ericsson (ERICb.ST) and Nokia (NOKIA.HE) by backing challengers who make more flexible software versions of traditional mobile gear. Cisco, known for making networking gear that moves big volumes of data around the internet, wants a bigger share of the mobile market by backing these alternative providers rather than by making radio access equipment itself. Its radio access network push is part of Cisco’s efforts to prove to mobile network operators that investing in modern infrastructure and automation tools can help them to cope with increased data demands, while lowering costs. The Silicon Valley company made the announcement ahead of this week’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, where hundreds of telecom operators are looking for new ways to deal with exploding customer data demands and intense pricing pressures. Cisco said it is working with more than 20 network operators to offer next-generation 5G services, which promise to deliver not just faster phones and video, but also connected cars and internet-connected industrial sensors over the next decade. “Many of the things we enable you to do, you can do before 5G,” Yvette Kanouff, general manager of Cisco’s business unit for telecom service providers, told Reuters in an interview. Ray Mota, an industry analyst at ACG Research, said Cisco was looking to convince operators to spend more on what he called “precursors to 5G”, which solve pressing network issues but won’t need to be replaced once 5G rolls out in earnest starting around 2020. Ovum, another research firm, said Cisco’s message was that “an operator can deliver much of the functionality of 5G, with up to 85 percent of its features, today.” So-called virtual Radio Access Network (vRAN) providers include mobile industry outsiders like Intel (INTC.O), Red Hat RHAT.O, Mavenir, Phazr, and Tech Mahindra which seek to replace proprietary wireless radios made by the mobile industry’s big three with cloud-based software. Virtual radio gear enables customers to rely on commodity computer hardware, cutting out big costs for mobile networks. Cisco’s effort is supported by Indian operator Reliance Jio, which since 2016 has up-ended the country’s mobile market by building a state-of-the-art 4G network and giving away free voice and data services for six months to win a wide following. Cisco’s bid to open up the market puts it in competition with the big mobile equipment vendors, including No. 2 ranked Ericsson. Cisco also has a two-year-old joint sales pact with Ericsson in which they cooperate on 160 current deals, Kanouff said. Network market research firm Dell’Oro estimates that revenue from Radio Access Network (RAN) equipment - which has declined in recent years - is set to stabilize before growing modestly to around $30.5 billion by 2022 as 5G commercial networks take off.

239,INTC,Intel downplays report of interest in Broadcom,"(Reuters) - Microchip maker Intel Corp (INTC.O) responded to a news report that it is considering a possible bid for Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O) by saying that it is focused on integrating previous acquisitions, raising doubt over the idea. The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Intel’s competitive concern about Broadcom’s attempt to buy mobile chip rival Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) had led it to consider a range of acquisitions in response, including a bid for Broadcom. In response to an inquiry about the Journal’s report, Intel said it does not comment on “rumors or speculation” related to mergers and acquisitions but that it is focused on its previous acquisitions. “We have made important acquisitions over the past 30 months - including Mobileye and Altera - and our focus is on integrating those acquisitions and making them successful for our customers and shareholders,” Intel said in a statement to Reuters. Intel acquired autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye last year and acquired programmable chip maker Altera in late 2015. Broadcom did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shares of Broadcom rose 3.6 percent to $262.93 in after hours trade on Friday. Qualcomm and Intel each fell less than 1 percent, to $62.87 and $51.84, respectively. Singapore-based Broadcom’s $117 billion bid for Qualcomm faces concerns by U.S. regulators worried about potential Chinese influence on the company and U.S. ability to influence the creation of the next generation of mobile networks, called 5G.  Qualcomm has sought assurances from Broadcom over potential antitrust issues. Intel is mostly known for making chips that are the brains of personal computers and data centers, though it has made progress gaining smart phone manufacturing customers such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O).  If Broadcom buys Qualcomm, Intel would face a much bigger competitor, nearly equal to itself in market heft. Broadcom and Qualcomm are worth close to $100 billion each and a combination would be the biggest tech deal ever. An Intel deal would be significantly bigger, since its market capitalization alone is nearly $240 billion.  The Journal reported that Intel had been considering a Broadcom bid since late last year and was working with advisers, although the newspaper said one of its sources described a bid as unlikely given the complexity of the combination. Still, antitrust consultant Linley Gwennap said Intel likely could convince regulators to allow it to take over Broadcom, despite the size, since the companies largely make different types of microchips. VLSI Research chief Dan Hutcheson agreed. “There’s product overlap, but it’s really inconsequential,” he said.

Intel acquired autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye last year and acquired programmable chip maker Altera in late 2015. Broadcom did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shares of Broadcom rose 3.6 percent to $262.93 in after hours trade on Friday. Qualcomm and Intel each fell less than 1 percent, to $62.87 and $51.84, respectively. Singapore-based Broadcom’s $117 billion bid for Qualcomm faces concerns by U.S. regulators worried about potential Chinese influence on the company and U.S. ability to influence the creation of the next generation of mobile networks, called 5G.  Qualcomm has sought assurances from Broadcom over potential antitrust issues. Intel is mostly known for making chips that are the brains of personal computers and data centers, though it has made progress gaining smart phone manufacturing customers such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O).  If Broadcom buys Qualcomm, Intel would face a much bigger competitor, nearly equal to itself in market heft. Broadcom and Qualcomm are worth close to $100 billion each and a combination would be the biggest tech deal ever. An Intel deal would be significantly bigger, since its market capitalization alone is nearly $240 billion.  The Journal reported that Intel had been considering a Broadcom bid since late last year and was working with advisers, although the newspaper said one of its sources described a bid as unlikely given the complexity of the combination. Still, antitrust consultant Linley Gwennap said Intel likely could convince regulators to allow it to take over Broadcom, despite the size, since the companies largely make different types of microchips. VLSI Research chief Dan Hutcheson agreed. “There’s product overlap, but it’s really inconsequential,” he said.

244,INTC,Inability to audit U.S. elections a 'national security concern': Homeland chief,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Not having a verifiable way to audit election results in some states represents a “national security concern,” the Trump administration’s homeland security chief said on Wednesday, looking ahead to U.S. midterm elections in November. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was prioritizing election cyber security above all other critical infrastructure it protects, such as the financial, energy and communications systems, the agency’s chief, Kirstjen Nielsen, told the Senate Intelligence Committee. The hearing to examine the Trump administration’s efforts to improve election security came following U.S. intelligence officials’ repeated warnings that Russia will attempt to meddle in the 2018 contests after doing so during the 2016 presidential campaign. It was held on the same day that lawmakers were expected to unveil a federal spending bill that sources familiar with the negotiations said included nearly $400 million for election security. Nielsen endorsed paper ballot backups for electronic voting systems as an important safeguard in ensuring that tabulated election results are not  tampered with.  New Jersey, Delaware, Georgia, Louisiana and South Carolina have no verifiable paper ballot backup across their states, though some are looking to purchase systems that provide such audits. Eight other states, including Pennsylvania, have some electoral districts without paper backups. Nielsen testified alongside her predecessor, former DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson, as the two sought to defend their work over the past two years overseeing efforts to steer the agency more toward protecting election systems. Under Johnson, the agency designated election systems as critical infrastructure in January 2017, months after President Donald Trump was elected. Both Johnson and Nielsen said they had “no doubt” that Russian leadership at a very high level was involved in the attempt to interfere in the U.S. election, which U.S. intelligence agencies concluded was done in order to boost Trump’s candidacy.  They also acknowledged challenges the agency had faced but agreed progress had been made to work better with states and more fully understand the threat posed by Russia and others.  “Today I can say with confidence that we know whom to contact in every state to share threat information,” Nielsen said. “That ability did not exist in 2016.” Nielsen said that more than half of U.S. states have signed up for the agency’s cyber scanning services designed to detect potential weaknesses that could be targeted by hackers. Nielsen repeated the agency’s findings last year that 21 states had experienced initial probing of their systems from Russian hackers in 2016 and that a small number of networks were compromised, but that there remains no evidence any votes were actually altered. Senator Richard Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on Wednesday the need for improvements in election security was “urgent” but it was unclear if fixes would be in place this year or even by the next presidential election in 2020. The committee on Tuesday released draft recommendations to bolster election security. Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat on the committee, faulted voting machine vendors for being “accountable to no one” and refusing to answer questions he has repeatedly asked them about their security efforts. Nielsen said she was unaware of any federal agency, including her own, that had the authority to mandate that vendors comply with security standards. On a later panel, Wyden asked DHS cyber security official Jeanette Manfra how confident she was that voting machine vendors sold equipment that complied with common best security practices. “It is hard for me to judge right now,” Manfra responded. “I do not have perfect insight into the machines that the states buy,” adding that some vendors voluntarily submitted machines to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission for security review.

247,INTC,Apple plans to replace Intel chips in Macs with its own: Bloomberg,"(Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is planning to use its own chips in Mac computers beginning as early as 2020, replacing processors from Intel Corp (INTC.O), Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter. The initiative, code-named Kalamata, is still in early developmental stages but is part of a bigger strategy to make Apple’s family of devices work more similarly and seamlessly together, according to the report. Apple, which has used Intel chips in its computers since 2005, and the computer chipmaker both declined to comment.     Intel shares closed down 6.1 percent at $48.92, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq .IXIC ended down 2.7 percent. Stifel analyst Kevin Cassidy said in a note he believed the market was “over reacting” to the report on Apple’s plans and that Intel’s prospects remained good. “We do not expect any other PC manufacturers will consider designing its own CPUs,” he wrote in the note. Other analysts said Apple would likely phase Intel’s chips out over time. “While it’s possible that Apple may replace Intel in some of its lower-end product lines, we think it will be difficult for Apple to completely replace Intel by 2020, especially on its higher-end offerings,” said Summit Insights group analyst Kinngai Chan. The Mac plays a small part in Apple’s overall financial picture, with sales of 19.2 million units last year and accounting for 11 percent of Apple’s $229.2 billion in revenue for fiscal 2017. But while the laptop and desktop computer market has been in a years-long slump amid the rise of smartphones and tablet computers, Mac sales rose 4 percent in 2017. The growth came even as PC sales declined slightly to 259.5 million units, the smallest drop since 2011, according to data from research firm IDC. While Apple’s reported move away from Intel would be a major shift for its Mac lineup, it follows years of increasing focus on designing its own chips for its devices. The company has been designing its own iPhone processors since the release of the iPhone 4 in 2010 and has steadily increased the amount of chip work it handles itself.  “We can push the envelope on innovation. We have better control over timing, over cost and over quality,” Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said of Apple’s chip efforts last year.

251,INTC,"UPDATE 1-TSMC shares slide as revenue estimate cut; other Apple, chip stocks also fall","TAIPEI (Reuters) - Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd tumbled and other Apple supplier and chip stocks fell after it cut its full-year revenue target on softer demand for smartphones. Also citing uncertainty in the cryptocurrency mining market, the world’s largest contract chipmaker said revenue for 2018 is likely to grow 10 percent rather than the earlier forecast of 10-15 percent. TSMC’s shares slid as much as 6.8 percent in morning trade to its lowest level since Dec. 29.

252,INTC,"Intel soars after brighter forecast for data centers, memory","(Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) beat earnings expectations for the first quarter and raised its full-year revenue and profit forecasts on Thursday, driven by the biggest-ever quarterly jump in its data center business and small-but-steady growth in its personal computer business. Shares of the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker rose 5.4 percent to $55.95 in after-market trading after it said it expects full-year revenue of $67.5 billion, up $2.5 billion from prior guidance. Intel has been focused on transforming itself from a supplier of processors for personal computers to a maker of chips for growing data center business and newer areas such as driverless cars and artificial intelligence. That shift appeared to be taking hold as revenues for Intel’s data center business accounted for almost half of the company’s revenue in the first quarter, the highest proportion ever. “They certainly outperformed the most bullish expectations,” said Kinngai Chan of Summit Insights Group. Intel said fresh demand for applications such as artificial intelligence fueled the data center business. But Intel Chief Financial Officer Robert Swan warned that the brisk growth of that business in the past two quarters, particularly from business customers building out their own computing clouds, would be hard to match in the second half the year. “We do expect there to be deceleration for [data center business] growth from first half to second half for sure,” Swan said on a conference call with investors. “We hope we’re wrong.” Still, the better-than-expected results and brighter forecast pushed shares to their highest in at least five years. The data center results also suggest the chipmaker’s large customers have not been deterred by two chip flaws that emerged earlier this year. Intel said it plans to allot $14.5 billion to capital spending this year, much of which will go toward building up its relatively new memory chip business. But the company also said $1.7 billion of its free cash flow for the quarter came from long-term supply agreements for its memory business, which could help protect the company against a drop in memory prices that has spooked chip investors this year. That business grew 20 percent year over year to $1 billion. Intel executives also said that the unit that contains its modem chips that help Apple Inc (AAPL.O)’s iPhones connect to mobile data business will grow faster than the rest of Intel’s sales. Intel’s Swan said investments in that division to ramp it up could compress Intel’s margins in the short term. Last fall, Reuters reported that Apple had designed iPhones and iPads that could drop Qualcomm Inc’s (QCOM.O) modem chips in favor of Intel chips, though it is not clear Apple has yet made a final decision.  Revenue from Intel’s client computing business, which supplies chips to PC makers and is the biggest contributor to sales, rose 3 percent to $8.2 billion, beating estimates of $7.91 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue from the data center business posted a record gain of 24 percent to $5.2 billion, beating estimates of $4.73 billion. The company’s net income rose to $4.45 billion, or 93 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from $2.96 billion, or 61 cents per share, a year earlier. Net revenue rose to $16.07 billion from $14.80 billion. Excluding items, the chipmaker earned 87 cents per share.

260,INTC,"U.S. tech, banks are big winners from lower taxes in first quarter","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. technology heavyweights like Apple, Amazon and Intel along with Wall Street’s biggest banks look like the early winners from Republicans’ corporate tax cuts, boosting their bottom lines by more than $11 billion so far, a Reuters analysis of first-quarter earnings showed. Graphic: Tech and Banks Win Big from Tax Cuts - reut.rs/2rfY7Uv S&P; 500 companies on average have slashed their median effective tax rates to 21 percent in the March quarter, down 6 percentage points from a year ago, according to an analysis of 252 earnings reports. That has translated into a nearly $18 billion reduction in income tax provisions in the first quarter, more than half of which accrued to the benefit of the tech and finance industries. Graphic: FAANG Blunts its Tax Bill - reut.rs/2I3okPN The financial and technology sectors lead others in the size of their profits, and they also reduced their effective tax rates more than others during the most recent quarter.  In the latest big example, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Tuesday reported a $13.8 billion net profit for the March quarter, up $2.8 billion from the year before, with nearly half of that increase resulting from a reduced tax rate. Changes to how overseas profits are treated also allowed it to plow a record amount of cash into stock repurchases. Companies’ tax rates rise and fall over time for a variety of reasons, making it difficult to say how much of the quarter’s broad tax-rate decline was a direct results of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed by Republican lawmakers in December.  However, this quarter’s drop in average tax rates provisioned by recently reporting S&P; 500 companies was dramatic compared with changes in the same quarter in recent years, and many companies attributed their lower tax rates to the fiscal overhaul. The companies in the Thomson Reuters analysis had median tax rates of 27 percent in the first quarter of 2017 and 29 percent in the first quarter of 2016. Intel (INTC.O) halved its tax rate in the first quarter to 11 percent, primarily because of the tax cuts, reducing the chipmaker’s effective tax bill by around $560 million. Amazon.com’s (AMZN.O) tax rate declined by 9 percentage points in the March quarter, adding $170 million to its bottom line. Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Citigroup (C.N), JPMorgan (JPM.N), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and Bank of America (BAC.N) trimmed their tax bills by a combined $2 billion in the first quarter, compared to what they would have set aside using last year’s tax rates.      About a third of expected U.S. corporate earnings expansion in the March quarter is a result of the tax cuts, a trend that is likely to continue through 2018, said Patrick Palfrey, an earnings analyst at Credit Suisse.  “What we’re experiencing is a very strong underlying growth trend, which is being driven by revenue and margin growth,” Palfrey said. “That’s being augmented by the tax change.” The biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in over 30 years, the new law slashes the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and reshapes how the government taxes multinational corporations. Its passage pushed Wall Street to record highs, with analysts recently forecasting a 25 percent leap in aggregate S&P; 500 earnings in the March quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  S&P; 500 information technology companies on average slashed their first-quarter effective tax rates by 9 percentage points, outdone only by the telecommunication group’s 10 percent reduction. They are followed by financials, which on average cut their tax rates by 8 percentage points. Apple cut its effective tax rate to 15 percent in the March quarter from 25 percent a year before. Alphabet’s (GOOGL.O) effective tax rate of 11 percent in the first quarter netted the Google owner an additional $1 billion in net income compared to what it would have earned using its tax rate of 20 percent in the first quarter of 2017. Alphabet attributed its lower tax rate to changes in accounting rules for reporting investments, as well as to the Tax Act. Twitter (TWTR.N) said that $21 million of its $70 million increase in non-GAAP quarterly net income was due to the tax cut. Raytheon (RTN.N) cut its tax rate by 10 percentage points in the March quarter, equivalent to $83 million, and the missile maker raised its 2018 earnings forecast in part because of the tax cuts. Hershey Co (HSY.N) cut its adjusted tax rate to 25 percent in the March quarter from over 30 percent the year before, an improvement it attributed to the tax cut.
