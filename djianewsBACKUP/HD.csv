The U.S. bank is considering moving the division out of Citi Holdings, where it keeps less important assets, to a place alongside its core credit card operations, the FT said, citing people familiar with the matter.  The change was prompted by improved credit conditions and uncertainty over the outlook for other consumer businesses such as retail banking and mortgages, the newspaper said.  The FT also said Citi plans to wait until it sells OneMain Financial, its consumer-lending business, and shed or run off other assets in Citi Holdings before deciding on the cards unit.

4,HD,China fashion market to surpass $201 bln by 2020-BCG," SHANGHAI, July 15 (Reuters) - China’s fashion market is expected to triple in size to more than 1.3 trillion yuan ($201.3 billion) in the next 10 years driven by the rise of the middle-class affluent consumer in China, Boston Consulting Group said in a report on Friday.	   China’s fashion market, currently dominated by sportswear brands and local casual clothing brands, was worth around 400 billion yuan in 2010. Per capita spending among urban consumers was a low 1,150 yuan per year, roughly one-fifth of per capita spending in the United States and the United Kingdom, BCG said.	   “Per capita consumer spending in China is still in the early part of the penetration curve compared with that in mature markets, giving China the potential to become an even more significant fashion market,” the report said.	   The low penetration rate means China will account for 30 percent of the global fashion market’s growth over the next five years.	   China’s fashion scene is dominated by sports brands such as Nike Inc , Adidas AG (ADSGn.DE) and Li Ning who entered the market early and now have thousands of retail outlets spread across the country.	   However, that could change as consumers across cities “trade up” and become more sophisticated, preferring a variety of brands to suit different occasions, BCG said. 	   BCG also estimates that companies would need to have a presence in 568 cities in China in order to reach 80 percent of the mid- to high-priced fashion market in 2020, up from 462 currently.	   Rising incomes in China have led to a flood of fashion companies such as Gap and American Eagle Outfitters  thronging to get a piece of the market.	   But a fragmented retail distribution network and the inability of international firms to localise their products have led to exits of some consumer retail firms such as Best Buy  and Home Depot .

John Tilak and Allison Martell   TORONTO, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Rona Inc’s RON.TO quarterly profit dropped a steeper-than-expected 40 percent as Canadian consumers cut spending on its home improvement products, sending its shares down 5 percent.   The reluctance of homeowners to invest in big-ticket renovation projects, the lifeblood of Rona’s business, has plagued Canada’s No. 1 do-it-yourself chain.   Second-quarter sales at its established stores fell 9.6 percent, following a 12.6 percent decline in the first quarter.  “The results were ugly — in all capital letters and bold,” Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said. “People are just not willing to spend.”   Second-quarter earnings fell to C$39.5 million ($39.9 million), or 28 Canadian cents a share, from C$66.3 million, or 51 Canadian cents, a year before.   Analysts on average were looking for earnings of 40 Canadian cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   Revenue fell 2 percent to C$1.37 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of C$1.43 billion.   The company sees same-store sales staying little changed or falling up to 5 percent in the second half of the year. It sees earnings in the second half to be little changed from the year earlier.   Consumer spending on home improvement products has remained tepid, never fully returning though the country’s economic downturn eased over the past year. Rona’s more expensive discretionary products such as solariums and patios are seen as a low priority when budgets are tight.   “We faced very challenging conditions in the quarter, especially in April and May, when weather was not favorable for construction and renovation projects,” said Chief Executive Officer Robert Dutton on a conference call.   Dutton also said the company was hurt by consumers’ continuing prudent spending on renovation.   Yarbrough said weather was not the issue. Same-store sales have not grown on an annual basis since 2006, he said.   “The consumer spending environment is weak, but more so in home improvement.”   The company competes with Home Depot Inc (HD.N) (HD.N) and Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N). Both companies reported falling same-store sales in the first quarter of 2010 and are due to report second-quarter results next week.   Those companies do not break out their Canadian sales, however. Yarbrough said Rona may be facing a tougher environment north of the border.   “The industry overall is tough in Canada. Home Depot and Lowe’s are struggling as well in Canada,” Yarbrough said.   The stock, down 24 percent since the start of the year, fell 5 percent to C$10.20 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. It hit a near-three-year low of C$10.03 earlier in the day.

8,HD,"Homeowners delay renovations, Lowe's cuts forecast","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) reported weaker-than-expected quarterly sales and cut its fiscal-year outlook for the second time in three months as homeowners put off big renovations in an anemic U.S. economy.  The news pushed the second-largest home improvement chain’s shares down 1.3 percent on Monday, and made some analysts take a more cautious stance on retailers selling hard goods such as furniture and appliances.  Lowe’s is a victim of the ailing economy, weak housing market as well as cut-throat competition from larger rival Home Depot Inc (HD.N), analysts said.  “The bulk of what is happening here is that the economy has yet to give them traction,” Stifel Nicolaus analyst David Schick told Reuters.  U.S. homebuilder sentiment remained stuck near historic lows in August.  Consumer sentiment in the world’s largest economy worsened sharply in early August, falling to the lowest level in more than three decades. U.S. economic growth was anemic in the first half of the year.  “The volume of negative news and the unsettling impact on equity markets is having a significant effect on already fragile consumer mindset,” CEO Robert Niblock said on a conference call. “Consumers continue to focus on small ticket, less than $500, repair and maintenance items and projects.”  Lowe’s sales rose 1.3 percent to $14.54 billion in the second quarter, missing analysts’ estimate of $14.75 billion.  “Despite some recovery in our seasonal business, our performance for the quarter fell short of our expectations,” Niblock said.  Sales at stores open at least a year fell 0.3 percent. JP Morgan analyst Christopher Horvers was expecting same-store sales at Lowe’s to stay flat. Like many analysts, he expects industry leader Home Depot Inc (HD.N) to report better same-store sales when it reports quarterly results on Tuesday.  (For a related graphic, click r.reuters.com/qyx23s)  “The competitive landscape has changed. Five or ten years ago, Home Depot was not as competitive as they are today,” Schick said. “Home Depot becoming a more competitive, better run company makes it more difficult to get topline traction.”  Last week, Canadian rival Rona Inc RON.TO reported a steeper-than-expected 40 percent drop in quarterly profit.  BUDGET-CONSCIOUS SHOPPERS  Many U.S. homeowners have been hesitant to spend on expensive renovations as housing prices fall and the U.S. economy shows few signs of a stable recovery.  Home improvement chains have also found it harder to sell expensive items such as appliances.  On Monday, Barclays downgraded its view on the U.S. retail hardlines sector to “negative” from “neutral.”  Lowe’s, which closed seven underperforming stores, said it is now planning to offer more attractive opening price points and improve in-store layout to win shoppers. It is also launching the Spanish version of lowes.com this week.  Despite the weak outlook, analysts did not shun Lowe’s shares due to their attractive valuation.  “They do not have the momentum that Home Depot has and we expect Home Depot to report better results tomorrow but Lowe’s is cheaper and both valuations seem to incorporate a slowdown already,” Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter said.  Lowe’s now sees sales rising about 2 percent for the fiscal year ending February 3, down from its prior forecast for a 4 percent increase.  Net income was $830 million, or 64 cents a share, in the second quarter, compared with $832 million, or 58 cents a share, a year earlier.  Excluding special items, it earned 68 cents a share. On that basis, analysts were expecting 66 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  The company now sees earnings of $1.48 to $1.54 a share for the year. In May, it cut its forecast to a range of $1.56 to $1.64 a share, down from a prior outlook of $1.60 to $1.72.

Efforts to stem the spreading European debt crisis have so far been ineffective, a major reason for the equity market’s declines in recent weeks. Stocks were unable to rally on Tuesday despite positive U.S. earnings and Fitch Ratings’ decision to keep the AAA credit rating for the United States.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy detailed plans for closer euro zone integration but they did not include boosting the size of the euro zone’s rescue fund or sales of euro bonds.  “The market wanted to see at least some forward movement, something concrete coming out of the meeting that would’ve been supportive to what’s been dragging the market lower,” said Marc Pado, U.S. market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in San Francisco.  Shares of financials, seen as vulnerable to a European fiscal crisis, added to their decline and were the worst-performing sector in the S&P 500. The S&P financial index was down 1.9 percent.  Merkel and Sarkozy said they would propose a tax on financial transactions, which hurt shares of exchange operators. Shares of NYSE Euronext fell 8.4 percent to $26.54, making it the worst performer in the S&P 500.  Shares of retailers Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Home Depot Inc both rose after the industry bellwethers exceeded analysts’ expectations for quarterly numbers.  Dell Inc’s shares dropped 4.9 percent in after-hours trading after the company reported revenue slightly below analysts’ expectations and said sales in the present quarter would be flat.  Euro zone worries have weighed heavily on markets, most recently with last week’s concerns about the solvency of French banks and the continued uncertainty over the European Central Bank’s ability to control sovereign bond yields.

12,HD,"Wal-Mart U.S. sales start to perk up, as do shares","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc said same-store sales at its U.S. discount chain rose in July, as a renewed emphasis on offering low prices on a wide assortment of goods started to stem more than two years of quarterly sales declines.  Wal-Mart’s comments and better than expected quarterly results that it also reported on Tuesday sent its shares over 4 percent higher. The world’s largest retailer, with nearly 9,700 stores, stressed its commitment to pricing products below its competitors and emphasizing that promise to shoppers.  Walmart discount stores account for nearly 11 percent of U.S. retail sales. More of its shoppers are relying on government aid to help them pay for food and other necessities, are shopping less often to save money on gasoline and are spending less when paychecks run out, showing that the low- and middle-class Americans to which chains such as Walmart cater clearly remain under pressure.  Recent analyst reports have suggested that competitors have closed the price gap with Walmart in areas such as food.  “The vast majority of people who shop at Walmart no longer believe that Walmart is the lowest-priced on most things,” said Wendy Liebmann, CEO of WSL/Strategic Retail, citing her firm’s April survey of Walmart shoppers.  While Walmart U.S. same-store sales fell 0.9 percent in the quarter that ran from May through July, that measure rose in July and the company still expects it to rise on a quarterly basis at some point this year, Walmart U.S. Chief Executive Officer Bill Simon said.  “It seems like they’re going to kind of ramp up that pressure on lowering price,” said ITG Investment Research analyst John Tomlinson.  Wal-Mart posted larger-than-anticipated increases in quarterly profit and sales, helped by its Sam’s Club warehouse and international chains such as Britain’s Asda.  Still, the United States remains its biggest market, accounting for 62.1 percent of the $419 billion in sales last year, and many of Walmart’s U.S. customers are struggling.  “They’re trading down to stretch their budgets — buying a lower-priced brand of detergent, moving from branded canned goods to private label and purchasing half gallons of milk instead of gallons,” Wal-Mart Chief Executive Mike Duke said during a recorded call.  U.S. shoppers’ biggest economic concerns are job security, the rising cost of food and the high price of gasoline, Chief Financial Officer Charles Holley told reporters.  The number of shoppers relying on government aid has risen over the last 2-1/2 years, Holley said, noting that unemployment levels have been higher for people who had less education and less income to begin with.  Sales at Wal-Mart's U.S. discount stores open at least a year, excluding fuel, have now fallen for nine straight quarters. (Graphic on U.S. Walmart same-store sales: r.reuters.com/bad33s)  The second quarter’s decline was near the low end of Wal-Mart’s forecast of down 1 percent to up 1 percent. Analysts on average had expected a decline of 0.6 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Even though Walmart’s U.S. same-store sales were worse than those of competitors such as Target Corp, dollar stores and warehouse chains, Walmart gained momentum, said Wall Street Strategies analyst Brian Sozzi, who upgraded the shares to “hold” from “sell.”  Wal-Mart said U.S. same-store sales improved each month during the quarter. Fewer customers visited the stores, but those who shopped spent more on average.  Wal-Mart appears to be taking the right steps, including pricing changes, growing its international business and opening more smaller stores. But the stock may be too pricey for some as it is hard to see substantial changes in such a large company, said Larry Carroll, president of Carroll Financial, based in Charlotte, North Carolina.  “I’m neutral on it, and if it were 10 or 15 percent cheaper, I’d be inclined to buy it,” said Carroll, who has owned Wal-Mart in the past.

13,HD,"UPDATE 6-Wal-Mart U.S. sales start to perk up, as do shares"," * Q2 EPS $1.12 excluding items vs Street view $1.08   * Q2 U.S. Walmart same-store sales down 0.9 percent   * Sees quarterly U.S. same-store sales up by end of year   * Shares rise over 4 percent  (Adds comments, background details, updates stock activity)   By Jessica Wohl   CHICAGO, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) said same-store sales at its U.S. discount chain rose in July, as a renewed emphasis on offering low prices on a wide assortment of goods started to stem more than two years of quarterly sales declines.   Wal-Mart’s comments and better than expected quarterly results that it also reported on Tuesday sent its shares over 4 percent higher. The world’s largest retailer, with nearly 9,700 stores, stressed its commitment to pricing products below its competitors and emphasizing that promise to shoppers.   Walmart discount stores account for nearly 11 percent of U.S. retail sales. More of its shoppers are relying on government aid to help them pay for food and other necessities, are shopping less often to save money on gasoline and are spending less when paychecks run out, showing that the low- and middle-class Americans to which chains such as Walmart cater clearly remain under pressure.   Recent analyst reports have suggested that competitors have closed the price gap with Walmart in areas such as food.   “The vast majority of people who shop at Walmart no longer believe that Walmart is the lowest-priced on most things,” said Wendy Liebmann, CEO of WSL/Strategic Retail, citing her firm’s April survey of Walmart shoppers.   While Walmart U.S. same-store sales fell 0.9 percent in the quarter that ran from May through July, that measure rose in July and the company still expects it to rise on a quarterly basis at some point this year, Walmart U.S. Chief Executive Officer Bill Simon said.   “It seems like they’re going to kind of ramp up that pressure on lowering price,” said ITG Investment Research analyst John Tomlinson.   Wal-Mart posted larger-than-anticipated increases in quarterly profit and sales, helped by its Sam’s Club warehouse and international chains such as Britain’s Asda.[ID:nL6E7JC12D]   Still, the United States remains its biggest market, accounting for 62.1 percent of the $419 billion in sales last year, and many of Walmart’s U.S. customers are struggling.   “They’re trading down to stretch their budgets — buying a lower-priced brand of detergent, moving from branded canned goods to private label and purchasing half gallons of milk instead of gallons,” Wal-Mart Chief Executive Mike Duke said during a recorded call.   U.S shoppers’ biggest economic concerns are job security, the rising cost of food and the high price of gasoline, Chief Financial Officer Charles Holley told reporters.   The number of shoppers relying on government aid has risen over the last 2-1/2 years, Holley said, noting that unemployment levels have been higher for people who had less education and less income to begin with.   Sales at Wal-Mart's U.S. discount stores open at least a year, excluding fuel, have now fallen for nine straight quarters. (Graphic on U.S. Walmart same-store sales: r.reuters.com/bad33s)   The second quarter’s decline was near the low end of Wal-Mart’s forecast of down 1 percent to up 1 percent. Analysts on average had expected a decline of 0.6 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.   Even though Walmart’s U.S. same-store sales were worse than those of competitors such as Target Corp (TGT.N), dollar stores and warehouse chains, Walmart gained momentum, said Wall Street Strategies analyst Brian Sozzi, who upgraded the shares to “hold” from “sell.”   Wal-Mart said U.S. same-store sales improved each month during the quarter. Fewer customers visited the stores, but those who shopped spent more on average.   Wal-Mart appears to be taking the right steps, including pricing changes, growing its international business and opening more smaller stores. But the stock may be too pricey for some as it is hard to see substantial changes in such a large company, said Larry Carroll, president of Carroll Financial, based in Charlotte, North Carolina.   “I’m neutral on it, and if it were 10 or 15 percent cheaper, I’d be inclined to buy it,” said Carroll, who has owned Wal-Mart in the past.   Shares were up $2.41 at $52.39 in afternoon trading. Shares of Home Depot Inc (HD.N), which also reported better-than-expected quarterly results, climbed as well.

14,HD,Home Depot raises outlook; eclipses Lowe's,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc (HD.N) raised its fiscal-year profit forecast for the second time in three months as timely promotions and a focus on cheaper products helped the No.1 home improvement chain gain market share from rival Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N).  The news, which boosted Home Depot shares 4.7 percent to $32.95 on Tuesday, came a day after Lowe’s cut its fiscal-year outlook for the second time in three months, highlighting the widening performance gap between the two.  Home Depot has gained from its recent efforts to improve distribution and customer service. It has been quicker to cut costs than Lowe's, and in some cases has benefited as housing markets have improved in regions where it has a heavy presence. (For a related graphic, click r.reuters.com/syc33s)  Same-store sales rose in all but three of its top 40 markets, with particular strength in Midwest and South Atlantic regions, CEO Frank Blake said, adding he was “encouraged that soft housing markets like California, Florida, Arizona and Nevada were positive in the quarter.”  Home Depot said it still expects fiscal-year sales to rise 2.5 percent. It forecast earnings of $2.34 a share excluding future stock repurchases, up from a prior forecast of $2.24.  “They are operating at a high level, taking chances where appropriate in merchandising, leveraging technology investments, and benefiting from a return to more localized marketing and merchandising in the store,” said analyst David Strasser of Janney Capital Markets.  In the second quarter, Home Depot’s sales at stores open at least a year, rose 4.3 percent globally, including a 3.5 percent rise in U.S. same-store sales, making it the ninth consecutive quarter that it has outshone its smaller rival. Lowe’s same-store sales fell 0.3 percent in the quarter.  Same-store sales thus far into August are “quite positive,” CFO Carol Tome said on a conference call.  Under Chief Executive Frank Blake, Home Depot has upgraded service and products in its core retail business  “They knew they were suffering on the customer service front. They really made an effort to turn that around... I think it is really paying off,” said Thomas Villalta, a portfolio manager at the Jones Villalta Opportunity Fund in Austin, Texas, which owns Home Depot shares.  Strasser said the 4.3 percent same-store sales rise was better than his 2.5 percent estimate. Promotional programs, including a U.S. Independence Day appliance event and a late July event on storage products, helped win shoppers, he added.  Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter said that the stock is undervalued and set up for significantly stronger earnings when the housing sector stabilizes.  U.S. housing starts fell less than expected in July, a government report showed on Tuesday.  Still, U.S. homebuilder sentiment remained stuck near historic lows this month and consumer sentiment in the world’s largest economy fell to the lowest level in more than three decades in early August.  “The US housing market remains under stress,” CEO Blake said. “We do not expect any meaningful improvement in the housing market for the back half of 2011.”  Home Depot also beat estimates on quarterly profit as demand picked up for seasonal goods after a soft start to the spring selling season. Storm-related repairs also helped.  Its second-quarter net income rose to $1.36 billion, or 86 cents a share, from $1.19 billion, or 72 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting 83 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Sales rose 4.2 percent to $20.23 billion, beating analysts’ average estimate of $19.96 billion.  Demand was strong for building materials and outdoor garden products. Home Depot has shifted focus to cheaper products such as faucets and paint to increase shopper traffic.  It reported a 1.1 percent rise in the number of customer transactions in the second quarter, while the average ticket rose 3.3 percent to $54.04.  Sales at home improvement chains have suffered as homeowners have stayed away from bigger renovations and expensive items such as appliances in a weak U.S. economy.  The company, which has bought back $2.3 billion of common shares year to date, is targeting about $1.2 billion of additional share repurchases for the rest of the year.

15,HD,"Saks, Wal-Mart show widening U.S. consumer split","CHICAGO (Reuters) - At luxury department store chain Saks Inc SKS.N, customers were buying more designer suits at full price.  At Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), more customers were shopping with food stamps.  Wal-Mart and Saks, as well as home improvement retailer Home Depot Inc (HD.N) and off-price apparel chain TJX Cos Inc (TJX.N), posted quarterly results that beat analysts’ expectations on Tuesday.  But company comments about consumer spending showed the split between upper-income consumers who have jobs and are little affected by rising costs for food and other essentials, and lower-income shoppers who are struggling with stubbornly high unemployment and rising costs.  “This is exactly what we continue to see quarter after quarter. There’s just significant bifurcation here,” Edward Jones retail analyst Matt Arnold said.  Wal-Mart said same-store sales at its U.S. discount stores, by far its largest business, fell 0.9 percent in the second quarter, the ninth straight quarterly decline at domestic stores open at least a year.  A weak U.S. economy has sent consumer sentiment to its lowest level since 1980, reflecting the additional stress on some consumers.  “They’re trading down to stretch their budgets, buying a lower-priced brand of detergent, moving from branded canned goods to private label, and purchasing half gallons of milk instead of gallons,” Wal-Mart Chief Executive Mike Duke said in a recorded message.  Also, more shoppers are relying on government aid to help pay for food and other necessities, Walmart U.S. CEO Bill Simon said on the call.  The world’s largest retailer earned $1.09 per share from continuing operations in the second quarter, up from 97 cents a year earlier and near the high end of its forecast of $1.05 to $1.10.  Excluding a decline in the market value of currency derivatives, acquisition costs and other special items, profit was $1.12 per share, 4 cents above analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  FULL-PRICE/OFF-PRICE  Saks was able to beat expectations as it kept control of inventory, leading to more full-priced selling in its second quarter, which is typically a slow one for the retailer.  The company reported a loss of $8.4 million, or 5 cents per share, for the quarter ended July 30, compared with a loss of $32.2 million, or 21 cents per share, a year earlier.  Analysts on average expected a loss of 9 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  The company said it expects same-store sales to rise in the mid-to-high single digits on a percentage basis in the second half of the year. August sales were running in line with its fall-season forecast as its customers appeared to be shaking off the volatility in the financial markets.  “The affluent (shopper) has almost every piece of the puzzle in place other than housing,” Edward Jones’ Arnold said, referring to the housing market, which remains in a years-long slump.  Home Depot CEO Frank Blake said he does not expect meaningful improvement in the U.S. housing market this year.  But the home improvement chain has been able to beat out rival Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) by cutting costs more quickly and focusing on sales of lower-priced products to help increase traffic to its stores.

TJX posted a quarterly profit of 90 cents a share, beating analysts’ average estimate by a penny, as customers continued to shop its T.J.

Wal-Mart shares rose 3.8 percent in morning trade, while TJX shares were fractionally higher, Home Depot was up 5.1 percent and Saks fell 3.1 percent.

21,HD,"Sears disappoints again, cuts more jobs","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp’s (SHLD.O) quarterly loss almost quadrupled as the retailer failed to stop its prolonged sales decline even as it offered more margin-sapping discounts.  The news pushed down shares of the parent of the Sears department stores and Kmart discount chain by almost 7 percent to its lowest level in two years.  Sales at Sears Holdings have fallen every year since 2005, when billionaire investor Eddie Lampert formed the company by merging the two chains.  “Essentially, the message from consumers to Sears is “we will shop there, but not at the prices you wish to charge as we won’t pay full price for substandard service and unwelcoming physical facilities,” Credit Suisse’s Gary Balter said.  Sears shares fell 6.5 percent to $56.25  The retailer, home to brands such as Craftsman tools and Kenmore appliances, is a victim of the weak economy and stiff competition as well as its own problems.  Analysts have criticized Sears for relying too heavily on cost-cutting to boost profit, rather than upgrading its stores and improving its customer service.  It faces tough competition from retailers including Home Depot Inc (HD.N), Lowes Cos Inc (LOW.N), Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Target Corp (TGT.N) and Best Buy Co (BBY.N). It has been losing market share in appliances and apparel. For a related graphic, click r.reuters.com/fap33s Sears has made some decent investments in its internet offerings, but has fallen well behind the value offering at other rivals, Balter said.  The retailer has also been revamping its management team. It recently named former Hewitt Associates Chief Financial Officer Robert Schriesheim as its CFO and former FreshDirect executive Monica Woo as its new chief marketing officer. Former Avaya Inc AVXX.UL CEO Lou D’Ambrosio joined Sears as its CEO in February, ending the company’s three-year search for a new chief executive.  Sears Holdings has had trouble hiring executives since Lampert is seen as being difficult to work with and does not want to pay too much, Morningstar analyst Paul Swinand told Reuters in early August.  Higher costs also hurt Sears Holdings, which said it would lay off about 250 employees in support and field roles.  The news on Thursday came two months after the retailer laid off 700 employees who worked in the appliance section of its Kmart stores.  It is also closing 29 stores and seven product repair center locations, while converting 14 Sears Grand stores to Kmarts. The company said there could be more job cuts from those actions.

Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year fell 0.7 percent, with those at the namesake stores down 1.2 percent and Kmart staying flat.  The company blamed the lackluster sales numbers on weak demand for consumer electronics at both Sears and Kmart.  It took bigger discounts to boost sales of appliances, apparel and home goods.

23,HD,Lowe's sets aside $5 billion for share buyback,"BANGALORE (Reuters) - Lowe’s Companies Inc (LOW.N) put aside $5 billion to buyback its shares over the next two to three years, joining a string of companies digging into their cash reserves to shore up their stocks in a weak economy.  Shares of Lowe's, which is the second largest U.S. home improvement chain behind Home Depot Inc (HD.N), rose as much as 3 percent on Monday morning in a broader market rally .SPX.  However, it is unclear if the repurchase, which represents about a fifth of Lowe’s current market value, will prop up its stock that had fallen 23 percent this year through Friday.  The company’s stock has taken a hit as many U.S. shoppers have stayed away from expensive renovations in light of falling housing prices and homebuilder sentiment remained stuck near historic lows in August.  Home Depot’s announcement of a $1 billion share repurchase in late March initially boosted the stock, but it is down 15 percent since as home improvement chains found it harder to sell their wares to homeowners.  U.S. companies are increasingly using their cash to buy back their own shares, betting on a Wall Street rebound. As of August 11, U.S. companies had bought back $305.2 billion in shares this year, eclipsing the $300.7 billion total for all of 2010 and two-and-a-half times the 2009 amount.  Lowe’s, which has declared a cash dividend each quarter since going public in 1961, also set a regular quarterly dividend of 14 cents a share. It raised its divided by 27 percent in May.  Last week, the retailer reported weaker-than-expected quarterly sales and cut its fiscal-year outlook for the second time in three months as homeowners put off big renovations in an anemic U.S. economy.

25,HD,"Home Depot, Walmart, grocers get boost from Irene","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hurricane Irene sent East Coast shoppers into stores to stock up on essentials this week, instead of the clothes, notebooks and other supplies that retailers were counting on selling as children get ready to go back to school.  Chains such as Home Depot Inc (HD.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) were doing brisk business on Friday, selling water, flashlights, batteries and other goods in states standing in Irene’s potential track from the Carolinas to Massachusetts.  “Most probably, the biggest demand right now is for generators, obviously,” said Suzanne Roche, manager of a Sears (SHLD.O) store in Wilmington, North Carolina. “We have got customers calling nonstop.”  Irene is due to make its first U.S. landfall in North Carolina on Saturday. The storm, which battered Atlantic and Caribbean islands including the Bahamas and the Dominican Republic, is then expected to head to the densely populated Northeast.  Those who were not trying to squeeze in one last summer stay on the New Jersey shore or Long Island beaches may have been planning to go to shopping malls to buy clothes, shoes and other items for children who will soon head back to school. Now those plans will be on hold.  “Nobody is going to go to a mall to buy a pair of jeans,” said Richard Hastings, consumer strategist at Global Hunter Securities.  The back-to-school shopping season is the second-largest spending time for U.S. shoppers, behind the winter holidays.  The storm may dent the upcoming index of August sales at stores open at least a year by 1.5 percentage points, Hastings said.  About two dozen retailers, including department stores and apparel chains, are due to report monthly same-store sales on September 1. Analysts were expecting a 4.8 percent rise for August, Thomson Reuters said on Friday.  The storm could hurt retailers like Saks Inc SKS.N and Tiffany & Co (TIF.N) if airports stay closed for too long or people cancel trips, said Morningstar analyst Paul Swinand. The hurricane hitting on a weekend worsens its impact, he added.  That pain may be compounded following New York Governor Andrew Cuomo’s announcement that New York City’s subways, buses and commuter lines, which serve 8 million riders a day, will shut down around noon on Saturday.  Chains such as Target Corp (TGT.N) planned to keep their stores open as long as it is safe for shoppers and workers, and to comply with any evacuation orders.  Walgreen Co WAG.N said it would keep many stores open 24 hours a day to meet demand for supplies. It was still deciding which stores may close because employees might not be able to get to work.  Retailers kept shoppers informed online.  Home Depot, Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) and other chains posted details on their websites.  Whole Foods Market Inc WFM.O, known for its array of organic and natural products, was communicating with customers through local stores’ Facebook pages and other social media.  After rumors spread in West Hartford, Connecticut, that all local stores were out of water, employees of a Whole Foods there took pictures of all the water they had in the store and posted them on the Facebook page, a spokeswoman said.  If retailers have excess merchandise because they lose out on a weekend of the back-to-school shopping season, it “could lead to markdowns in September and October,” said Keith Jelinek, a director of AlixPartners’ global retail practice.  Hastings expects Home Depot to do well, as it has 35 percent more stores than Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) in the affected region. He also expects Newell Rubbermaid Inc (NWL.N) to benefit from demand for storage containers.  Newell shares rose about 1 percent on Friday. Among battery makers, Energizer Holdings Inc (ENR.N) was up almost 2 percent, and Spectrum Brand Holdings (SPB.N) gained nearly 3 percent.  Drugstores and grocery stores should also see a sales lift.  “It helps the supermarkets most because people really stock up,” said BB&T Capital Markets analyst Andrew Wolf, noting Supervalu Inc’s (SVU.N) strength in Boston and Philadelphia, and Safeway Inc SWY.N and Ahold’s AHLN.AS big presence in Washington.  Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co Inc GAPTQ.PK is stocking extra water, ice, bleach and other goods at its A&P, Waldbaum’s and Pathmark chains.  In particular, Irene could affect companies with a strong presence on the East Coast in terms of higher sales before the storm and potential closings once it hits.  BJ’s Wholesale Club BJ.N said 96 of its 190 stores are in the storm’s expected track. They are receiving extra deliveries of items such as batteries, flashlights, generators and groceries, and the Massachusetts-based company’s buyers are working to get water delivered to those locations.  Wal-Mart, which has an emergency operations center in its Bentonville, Arkansas headquarters, is tracking how the storm may affect roughly 600 of its stores and distribution centers.  It has also offered its help to governments in states such as New York, where hurricanes are less common.  “This is obviously not something that they probably plan for on a regular basis,” said Mark Cooper, Wal-Mart’s new senior director of emergency management, “so we just want to make sure that they know we are available to assist.”  ",8262011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-hurricane/home-depot-walmart-grocers-get-boost-from-irene-idUSTRE77P4HK20110826

At a Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) in New York’s Long Island City neighborhood late Thursday, it was mostly business as usual.   “It’s usually crazy here no matter what day of the week it is,” said manager Rose Ramos. “This is a normal day for us.”   Some items were selling faster than others as Hurricane Irene set its sights on the largest city in the United States. Costco stacked 24-packs of Poland Spring and Glaceau water bottles by its entrance.   “The water is going very quickly,” Ramos said. “People want to stock up.”   Tim Buxton, a missions director at the Times Square Church, stopped in to get supplies for the church’s 22 interns. The church has not decided whether to hold services on Sunday, when the storm is expected to reach New York, he said as he pushed a cart filled with four cases of gallon-water jugs, four packs of bottled water, instant soup and granola bars.   Based on Friday’s storm track from the National Hurricane Center, 96 BJ’s Wholesale Club BJ.N stores in 10 states will be affected, a spokeswoman said. Those stores are receiving extra deliveries of items such as batteries, flashlights, generators and groceries, and the Massachusetts-based company’s buyers are working to get water delivered to those locations.

28,HD,Lowe's trims management in turnaround effort,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos (LOW.N), the world’s second-largest home improvement chain, said on Monday that three senior executives had left the company as part of a management shake-up aimed at improving its U.S. operations.  The chain’s U.S. stores will now operate under three divisions — North, South and West. Previously, it had divided its largest market into at least five regions.  The news came just weeks after Lowe’s reported weaker-than-expected quarterly sales and cut its fiscal-year outlook for the second time in three months. Lowe’s has underperformed larger rival Home Depot Inc (HD.N) on the same-store sales front for nine straight quarters now.  “They are clearly taking cost out,” Bernstein analyst Colin McGranahan said. “They are moving to a smaller organization, which is probably more appropriate considering they are no longer growing at the rate they were when they created the organization.”  As part of the changes, Theresa Anderson and Robert Wagner, previously senior vice presidents of operations, and Patricia Price, previously senior vice president and general merchandising manager of its home decor unit, will leave the company.  “This is not about dollar savings. This is about getting the right structure in place to move forward,” Lowe’s spokeswoman Chris Ahearn said.  Eric Sowder, senior vice president and general merchandising manager, outdoor living, had announced in July plans to retire from Lowe’s on September 9. Ahearn said that Sowder’s retirement was not related to the reorganization.  Sales at home improvement chains have declined as a weak economy and high unemployment have led shoppers to avoid costly renovations.  Home Depot has gained from its recent efforts to improve distribution and customer service. It has been quicker to cut costs than Lowe’s, and in some cases benefited as housing markets improved in regions where it has a heavy presence.  Lowe’s new structure with three regional divisions is similar to those at big-box retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Home Depot, McGranahan said.  “Certainly, this is a structure that is tried and tested,” he said. McGranahan added: “They are trying to get some fresh perspective in the ranks too.”  The new structure will not change things in the short term but should help the company become more efficient down the road, he said.  On Monday, Lowe’s said it had also decided to consolidate its merchandising operations into two product units from four.  Lowe’s laid off about 1,700 middle managers across the United States in January as it faced the weak economy, soft housing market and stiff competition.

30,HD,"Irene likely dented August auto, retail sales","NEW YORK/DETROIT (Reuters) - Hurricane Irene hit the U.S. East Coast at the most inopportune time for many businesses, keeping millions of shoppers away from stores and auto dealerships during what should have been a busy weekend.  Irene struck a wide area from North Carolina to Vermont, inflicting damage on the August sales results that automakers and many big U.S. retailers are set to report later this week.  The weight of low consumer confidence, the stock market and low inventories of Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and Honda Motor Co (7267.T) vehicles are the key reasons auto analysts expect U.S. new vehicle sales to fall in August from July or be flat at best.  Still, analysts predict a 5.2 percent increase from August 2010, though that tally was made before the weekend’s storm shut many East Coast auto dealerships.  “What’s concerning to us is a huge percentage of sales come in the last weekend or the last week of the month so it hit at that really crucial time,” said Edmunds.com analyst Michelle Krebs. “The good news is that sales are better than May and June.”  The storm also forced stores including Macy’s Inc (M.N) and TJ Maxx in New York to close over the weekend, a period when people are more likely to be shopping.  A tally issued by Thomson Reuters on Monday found that analysts expect the 25 retailers in its index — including Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), Target Corp (TGT.N), J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N) and Saks Inc SKS.N — to report a 4.7 percent increase in August sales at stores open at least a year, a measure known as same-store sales.  The chains that report monthly sales represent only about 10 percent of retailers, and the storm affected roughly 15 percent of the U.S. population, said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, who lost power at his Connecticut home early on Sunday.  “There will be a few retailers that will use the hurricane as an excuse for poor performance, but these are some of the same people who have been performing poorly for months now,” he said. “Gap’s numbers are going to be lousy this month, Aeropostale’s will not be good, but they were bad before the storm.”  AUTO SALES UP - AND DOWN  As much as a fifth of U.S. auto sales are often generated in the states that were affected by Irene, said Paul Taylor, chief economist with the National Automobile Dealers Association. In those states, August sales will likely be down about 10 percent.  A bigger problem related to Irene may affect September sales as well, Taylor said.  “The real issue is going to be flooding,” he said.  The average forecast of 44 economists surveyed by Reuters was 12.1 million vehicles were sold on an annualized basis, up from 11.5 million a year ago, but off slightly from 12.2 million in July.  Honda appears to be struggling the most. Edmunds.com and TrueCar.com expect Honda’s sales for August to drop by 22 to 25 percent from last August, and for Toyota’s sales to fall 11 percent to 14 percent.  They show General Motors Co’s (GM.N) August sales up 20 percent, Ford Motor Co (F.N) up 12 to 14 percent, Chrysler Group LLC up 21 to 22 percent and Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) up 16 to 22 percent. Chrysler is under the management of Italy’s Fiat SpA. FIA.MI  Jim Ziegler, a dealer consultant who spoke with dozens of dealers on Monday, said August auto sales figures will “definitely take a hit” due to Irene.  Due to power outages and flooding, Ziegler said, customers are not expected to return in big numbers until the upcoming Labor Day weekend in early September.  Still, auto dealers are happy the storm was not as damaging as some had expected.  “Almost everybody has the feeling that they dodged a bullet,” Ziegler said.  Retailers that sell back-to-school items likely felt Irene’s pinch as the storm essentially shut down malls on a weekend when parents normally shop for clothes and notebooks, not bottled water and flashlights.  “This is a major weekend of sales that were planned, but that won’t happen, in one of the most densely populated regions,” said Joel Bines, a managing director of consulting firm AlixPartners.

Department stores including Penney and Macy’s and such clothing chains as Gap Inc (GPS.N) and Aeropostale Inc ARO.N are seen as most exposed to a slowdown.  Most retailers’ monthly reporting periods ended on Saturday, meaning the pain of Sunday’s missed sales will carry over into September’s tally. Chains that report monthly sales and are heavily exposed to the East Coast include BJ’s Wholesale Club Inc BJ.N and TJX Cos Inc (TJX.N).  Home improvement chains like Home Depot (HD.N) and supermarkets like Supervalu (SVU.N) likely received a boost that will continue as people pump water from their basements and focus on repairs.  However, those chains as well as others such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), do not report monthly sales.  A large portion of back-to-school sales, retailers’ second-most important season after the winter holidays, could be lost for good, especially if it takes time for the transportation infrastructure to get back in place.  “There are millions of dollars in economic activity and productivity that were lost and simply will not and cannot be recouped,” said weather tracking firm Planalytics.

Irene struck a wide area from North Carolina to Vermont, inflicting damage on the August sales results that automakers and many big U.S. retailers are set to report later this week.   The weight of low consumer confidence, the stock market and low inventories of Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and Honda Motor Co (7267.T) vehicles are the key reasons auto analysts expect U.S. new vehicle sales to fall in August from July or be flat at best.   Still, analysts predict a 5.2 percent increase from August 2010, though that tally was made before the weekend’s storm shut many East Coast auto dealerships.   “What’s concerning to us is a huge percentage of sales come in the last weekend or the last week of the month so it hit at that really crucial time,” said Edmunds.com analyst Michelle Krebs. “The good news is that sales are better than May and June.”   <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   Auto & retail sales graphic: r.reuters.com/deb53s  Same-store sales graphic:    r.reuters.com/juz43s  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>   The storm also forced stores including Macy’s Inc (M.N) and TJ Maxx in New York to close over the weekend, a period when people are more likely to be shopping.   A tally issued by Thomson Reuters on Monday found that analysts expect the 25 retailers in its index — including Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), Target Corp (TGT.N), J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N) and Saks Inc SKS.N — to report a 4.7 percent increase in August sales at stores open at least a year, a measure known as same-store sales.

Chrysler is under the management of Italy’s Fiat SpA.

33,HD,WRAPUP 2-U.S. retailers' August sales up despite hurricane," * August same-store sales seen up 4.6 pct-Thomson Reuters   * Hurricane Irene curbed some sales, helped others   * Costco, Limited, Macy’s, Target top expectations  (Adds more retailers, analyst comment)   By Martinne Geller   NEW YORK, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Many top U.S. retailers reported better-than-expected August sales, withstanding Hurricane Irene and sagging consumer confidence.   Analysts expect the 24 retailers tracked by Thomson Reuters to post a 4.6 percent gain in August sales at stores open at least a year.   Most of the early same-store sales reports were better-than-expected, with Gap Inc (GPS.N) among the few retailers to miss Wall Street's forecasts. For a graphic on same-store sales, click r.reuters.com/juz43s  August is the peak of back-to-school shopping, the second-most important period for U.S. retailers after the year-end holiday season. Sales in recent months have held up despite weak economic indicators, offering hope for August and the rest of the year, until the hurricane disrupted shopping along the East Coast during a key weekend.   “August sales were good up until Irene,” said Keith Jelinek, director of AlixPartners’ global retail practice. “The consumer realized they needed to spend for back-to-school, (and) there were promotions to drive the traffic and get the dollars.”   The next two weeks will be critical, he said, as stores work to clear back-to-school items and make room for fall and winter merchandise.   Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), the largest U.S. warehouse club and the biggest retailer to report monthly same-store sales, posted a higher-than-expected 11 percent rise late on Wednesday.   “August was a period like many others for Costco throughout the economic recovery, showcasing an upper middle-income consumer continuing to be fully engaged in the process of saving where applicable,” Wall Street Strategies analyst Brian Sozzi wrote in a research note.   Costco also said legendary co-founder Jim Sinegal plans to step down as CEO in January. [ID:nN1E77U274]   Limited Brands Inc LTD.N posted an 11 percent increase, surpassing analysts’ forecast of 7.6 percent and its own call for a high-single-digit percentage rise.   Macy’s Inc (M.N), which closed more than 100 stores for all or part of last Saturday due to Irene, said the storm shaved about 1.5 percentage points from its August sales. Still, it posted a 5 percent gain, topping the analysts’ estimate of 4.5 percent.   “We expect the hurricane’s effect on sales will be substantially offset as we move through September and the third quarter,” said Macy’s Chief Executive Officer Terry Lundgren.   Target Corp (TGT.N) beat analysts’ expectations of a 3.5 percent gain with a 4.1 percent increase.   While “the pace of the economic recovery is uneven and uncertain,” Target had “solid results” in the back-to-school and back-to-college categories, said CEO Gregg Steinhafel.   The discount chain made moves such as putting dorm-sized refrigerators next to clothing in some stores to spur sales.   The monthly sales tally speaks to the strength of consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70 percent of U.S. economic activity. Still, major retailers that saw brisk storm-related business, such as grocers, Home Depot Inc (HD.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), do not report monthly results.   Discount chains and drugstores should show the biggest increases, according to Thomson Reuters, helped by hurricane-related sales of items like batteries and bottled water.   The storm’s full sales impact will not be known until September’s monthly report, since many retailers’ August reporting periods ended on Saturday.   TJX Cos Inc (TJX.N) reported a 1 percent same-store sales gain, below the 2 percent forecast. The hurricane caused some weakness in August, but business rebounded solidly early in the September reporting period, leaving the off-price retailer comfortable with its quarterly sales and earnings forecasts.

35,HD,Big Republican donors wait on Perry-Romney duel,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Big Republican donors are still undecided on Rick Perry or Mitt Romney as their party’s best chance to defeat President Barack Obama in the November 2012 presidential election.  Only about a third of the Republican campaign cash raised four years ago has been committed so far for the upcoming election — a sluggish pace that is unlikely to pick up before next year.  “I haven’t seen any sort of huge swell of traditional Bush supporters going anywhere yet,” said Jan Baran, former general counsel to the Republican National Committee who advised President George H.W. Bush.  The big money remains on the sidelines for a few reasons. There are eight established candidates in the race but the competition between the front-runners — Texas Governor Perry and former Massachusetts Governor Romney — is just too close to call.  While there is no question that the donations will eventually start flowing, party insiders have not finished debating whether Perry or Romney is more electable when facing Obama.  Both Perry and Romney are aggressively courting big donors, who will be vital to mounting a national campaign next year and going up against a president who broke fundraising records in 2008.  Despite a faltering economy and slumping popularity, Obama is off to a strong fundraising start. His campaign has raised $47 million, which dwarfs all Republican contenders.  Romney, who has dropped behind Perry in national polls, took in $18 million during the second quarter of the year.  Perry, who entered the race last month, has yet to report fundraising figures. But finance experts expect he will be a formidable rival to Romney after having raised $39 million in his last race for governor in 2010.  One media report said Perry’s campaign aimed to raise at least $10 million out of the gate. That comes as Romney’s collections are expected to dip to below $10 million in the third quarter, according to a source close to his campaign. The third quarter is a traditionally weak fundraising period.  Still, Perry has ground to make up. Romney’s campaign is much more established after a presidential run in 2008 and, as co-founder of buyout firm Bain Capital, he has ties to deep pockets on Wall Street.  “Perry is largely unknown, certainly here in New York,” said Joe Schmuckler, an investment manager at Medley Capital who was Republican nominee John McCain’s treasurer in 2008 and is now backing Romney. “Perry is working hard to put together a network but Romney is way ahead” in the New York area.  Perry hits New York City this month for his first major Wall Street events. He will be hosted by Hank Greenberg, the former long-time chief executive of AIG, the insurance firm that imploded during the 2008 financial crisis.  Perry could benefit from ties to Rudy Giuliani, who Perry endorsed when the former New York mayor ran in the 2008 Republican race. Giuliani has not made an endorsement yet.  Both candidates trek to Washington later this month, where they will woo established Republican donors.  Dirk Van Dongen, president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors who was finance chair for Giuliani’s 2008 White House run, is hosting Perry.  “Several have come on board already and I expect the list to grow rapidly between now and Governor Perry’s first Washington event on September 27th,” Van Dongen said.  Romney’s Washington backers include American Bankers Association President Frank Keating, a former governor of Oklahoma, but he has been having fundraisers for months.  Several major Republican donors have not revealed their preferences yet.  Ken Griffin, chief executive of hedge fund giant Citadel is on the sidelines and early Home Depot Inc investor Ken Langone is also uncommitted.  Donors now have more options after the Supreme Court’s ruling involving the conservative activist group Citizens United and other legal decisions. The Citizens United decision lets corporations and individuals make unlimited donations to presidential candidates as long as they go through committees not technically associated with the official campaign.  American Crossroads, the big-spending group conceived by Republican strategist Karl Rove, is seen as the perfect depository for the Republican investor who has not made up his mind about a candidate.  “There is no better political investment than putting money in Karl’s hands,” said a former big fundraiser to President George W. Bush.  Fred Malek, a veteran Republican fundraiser who founded the spending group American Action Network, said donors to some extent have the luxury to wait for a sure thing.  “In the McCain campaign, for example, during the primary we had very difficult time raising money and all of a sudden we became the leader and money flooded in,” Malek said.

38,HD,Fortune Brands' home unit primed to invest,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fortune Brands Home & Security Inc FBHS_w.N will be able to meet more of its own business needs, once it is spun off from Fortune Brands Inc FO.N and not worry about competing with booze and golf for funding, the company’s chief executive said.  The maker of Moen faucets, Simonton windows and Master Lock locks is ready to invest in new products and possibly even acquisitions, CEO Chris Klein told Reuters just hours before the spin-off due after the stock market close on Monday.  Klein said that when the unit becomes a pure-play company, it will be able to invest in more projects, especially “second-tier” priorities that may not have been met when it was competing for resources as part of a conglomerate that also makes Jim Beam bourbon and Titleist golf equipment.  “Historically we would’ve had all of our top priorities funded,” Klein said. “It’s that next tier, where there’s some very attractive organic growth opportunities .... This will allow us to increase investment there.”  He cited the Master Lock brand as one growth area, as well as international expansion.  Fortune Brands Home & Security starts trading independently on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. The company’s “when-issued” shares traded at $12.20 on Monday afternoon, up 4 percent from their debut last month at $11.90.  Fortune’s remaining alcoholic drink business will trade as Beam Inc BEAM_w.N from Tuesday. That company’s “when-issued” shares were down 2.3 percent at $40.60. Fortune Brands fell 1 percent to $53.54 on its last day of trade on the NYSE.  Fortune Brands announced its break-up in December, saying it planned to spin off the home unit and sell or spin off its golf unit.  In May it said a group led by Fila Korea (081660.KS) would buy the golf business for $1.23 billion.  Even though Fortune said it planned to spin off the home unit, there was speculation on Wall Street about whether a buyer would emerge. The business was severely hurt when the bursting of the U.S. housing market crimped demand for its cabinets, doors, windows and faucets.  Klein declined to comment on future financial performance. In August, the company forecast mid-single-digit sales growth for the second half of 2011, outperforming an overall market it expected to be about flat.  The company derives 20 percent of its revenue from new home construction, Klein said, with the bulk coming from renovations and remodeling projects. About 26 percent of revenue comes from home goods stores like Lowes Cos Inc (LOW.N), Home Depot Inc (HD.N) and Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY.O).  In September, the company adopted a poison pill to protect shareholders from any hostile takeover. Klein said the move was due to market volatility, rather than a specific threat.  “We thought it was very much in the best interest of the shareholders ... to control the destiny of the company as it comes out, when it otherwise could have been vulnerable, really, just to volatility in the marketplace,” Klein said.  As for acquisitions, Klein said the company would be open.  “We’re not going to run out and say we need to do acquisitions but we’re open to looking at things that are out there, and would look at opportunities if they accelerated where we’re focused organically,” Klein said, pointing to home goods that consumers pick out, rather than generic building products.  He said small- to mid-sized companies would likely provide the right fit, given his firm’s debt of $520 million, credit facility of $1 billion and debt-to-earnings ratio of 1.8.

After Christie’s announcement, Home Depot co-founder Ken Langone signed up with the Romney camp, according to the campaign.  Langone, industrialist David Koch and hedge fund giant Paul Singer were among the elite fund-raisers who implored the Christie to seek the Republican nomination to run against President Barack Obama in 2012.  Other major donors have been on the fence waiting for the Republican race to shake out, with Romney and Texas Governor Rick Perry trading front-runner status, as others emerge and fall.  With Christie out of the race and the field largely set, signs are that Romney will be the biggest benefactor, some fund-raisers and analysts said.  “This is a good day for Mitt Romney,” said a major fundraiser for former President George W. Bush, a Republican, who asked not to be identified so he could speak freely. “Maybe some of them will go for Perry but I doubt it.”  Some of the high-profile fans of Christie were backers of former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in his presidential bids. Giuliani, a prolific fundraiser in 2008 before his campaign fizzled, is a social moderate and fiscal conservative, akin to Romney.  Romney and Perry are each now attracting about 23 percent of Republican voter support, according to an average of polls compiled by Real Clear Politics.  Romney and Perry are also close in the money race. Their campaigns must release third-quarter fundraising figures by October 15, and both are expected to raise between $10 million and $15 million.  Both are aggressively courting big donors, who will be vital to mounting a national campaign next year and going up against a Democratic president who broke fundraising records in 2008.  Romney was the early front-runner in the race for the nomination to oppose Obama’s re-election bid, but he faded when Perry entered the race in August, in part due to conservatives’ unease over his moderate record.  But Perry’s fortunes have faded in turn, hit by weak debate performances and verbal gaffes that raised questions for some big donors about his ability to beat Obama.  “We’re a little schizophrenic in the party right now,” said Ed Rogers, who was an aide to former Republican President George H.W. Bush.  “My sense always was that (the Christie speculation) was a lot of media hype and a few very rich men in New York City who wanted Superman to come out of the heavens,” said Brian Ballard, a Romney fundraiser in Florida.  The 2012 campaign is expected to be the priciest ever, with several billions of dollars spent, in the wake of court rulings that dramatically loosened campaign finance restrictions.  Obama is now seen as vulnerable with the weak economy and polls showing fewer than 45 percent of Americans approve of his job performance, but he is off to a strong fundraising start.  His campaign had raised $47 million by June 30, dwarfing all Republican contenders. He also has $38 million from the Democratic National Committee at his disposal.  But those with ties to big business are especially anxious to unseat Obama.  Christie backer billionaire Langone asked Obama in a cable television town hall last year to “not make people in business feel like we’re villains or criminals or doing something wrong.”  Hedge fund executive Singer is also a Giuliani backer and helped drive him to fundraising success in 2008.  Among the other Christie backers are Koch, who runs the oil and industrial conglomerate Koch Industries, which funds many conservative causes, including Tea Party groups.  Still, Koch gave the maximum amount to Romney’s presidential campaign in 2008.

42,HD,September likely good enough for most U.S. chains,"   * Same-store sales rise of 4.6 pct seen -Thomson Reuters   * Costco’s sales better than expected, Walgreen’s weaker   * Zumiez blows past expectations, raises guidance   By Jessica Wohl   Oct 6 (Reuters) - Bargain hunters helped retailers including Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) post strong September sales even as the stock market tumbled and consumer sentiment sagged.   Overall, U.S. retailers that report monthly sales are expected to post an average gain of 4.6 percent in sales at stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, according to Thomson Reuters.   Retailers are doing what they can to appeal to shoppers such as Joanna Polowitz, who said that she lost her job a month ago and thinks that the economy is getting worse.   “I’m definitely holding back, only buying necessities, socks for my son, food because it’s reasonable here,” Polowitz said as she shopped at a Walmart in North Bergen, New Jersey on Wednesday. “We’re buckling down, not going to dinner as much.” Most of the 23 retailers that still report monthly sales — chains such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) have abandoned the practice — issue their reports on Thursday.   Wednesday’s results were a mixed bag.   Costco, the largest warehouse chain, saw same-store sales, rise 12 percent in September, topping analysts’ forecast for 10.1 percent rise. [ID:nL3E7L517B]   And Zumiez Inc (ZUMZ.O), which sells clothing and equipment for sports such as skating and snowboarding, posted a 10.1 percent rise in same-store sales, while analysts were looking for just a 3.2 percent increase, and raised its profit forecast. [ID:nASA02WTM]   Walgreen Co’s WAG.N sales rose less than expected, due in part to a slower start to the flu season. [ID:nN1E7940AE]   The U.S. consumer in September “showed resilience in spite of all the troubling economic news,” but higher gasoline prices than a year earlier are still a factor, said Michael McNamara, vice president of research and analysis for MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse.   McNamara and others noted that Hurricane Irene, which battered the U.S. East Coast at the end of August, may have shifted some spending in September to home improvement.   Chains including Home Depot Inc (HD.N), Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) and Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD.O), which sell generators and other storm-related items, do not report monthly sales.   September is a particularly important time for retailers focused on children’s and young adult apparel. Back-to-school shopping is the second-largest retail spending season behind the holiday period of November and December.   Same-store sales rose 4.4 percent in September, according to data released by the Johnson Redbook Retail Sales Index on Tuesday. That index measures a sample of large general merchandise retailers.

43,HD,Lowe's vows fight as analysts favor Home Depot,"(Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) reported better-than-expected quarterly results and laid out a blueprint to win back shoppers from larger rival Home Depot Inc (HD.N), even as skeptics said they saw little chances of a fast turnaround at the smaller home improvement chain. From stepping up efforts to attract online shoppers to slashing prices permanently, Lowe’s is reworking its strategy to outdo the market leader. “We believe that through kind of the first part of 2012, we start to make up some ground and you start to see maybe us closing that gap in the second half of 2012,” CEO Robert Niblock told Reuters in a telephone interview. Lowe’s, a victim of the weak economy and housing market, has been slower to cut costs than Home Depot, whose sales at stores open a year or more have beaten its rival’s for nine straight quarters. In the third quarter, Lowe’s same-store sales performance was lackluster and below some analysts’ estimates. Sales at stores open at least a year rose just 0.7 percent. Analyst Alan Rifkin at Barclays was looking for a 1 percent increase. Demand for expensive renovations is still weak, Niblock said. “For big-ticket categories to become really healthy, primarily we need home prices to start appreciating,” he said, adding that U.S. consumers still have a “fragile mindset” due to high unemployment and economic uncertainty. Home Depot is due to report its quarterly results on Tuesday. Analysts across the board expect the market leader to outperform Lowe’s as it stands to benefit from recent moves to improve its distribution and customer service and cut costs. “They have been feeding share to Home Depot,” Rifkin said of Lowe’s. A recent move to offer low prices permanently rather than temporary discounts has helped Lowe’s sales a little but hurt margins, he added. “We do prefer Home Depot over Lowe’s,” Rifkin said. Others agreed. “There is still room for Home Depot to outperform relative to Lowe’s heading into 2012. What Lowe’s needs to do is take a hard look at their merchandising, their supply chain, their operations in order to flip that back into their favor,” Morningstar analyst Peter Wahlstrom said. On Monday, Niblock said he sees more room to cut costs. Lowe’s shares were up 2 percent at $23.58 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Lowe’s recently revamped its management and regional structure in an attempt to improve its U.S. operations. Its U.S. stores now operate under three divisions — North, South and West. Previously, it divided its largest market into at least five regions. The chain also consolidated its merchandising operations into two product units from four. Last month, Lowe’s said it was closing 20 of its U.S. locations and eliminating nearly 2,000 jobs, and slashing its store-opening plans to improve profitability. It laid off about 1,700 middle managers across the United States in January. The company nudged its fiscal 2011 sales growth forecast higher, to a range of 2 percent to 3 percent from its August forecast of 2 percent. Lowe’s said net income fell to $225 million, or 18 cents a share, in the third quarter ended October 28, from $404 million, or 29 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding charges related to store closings and discontinued projects, it earned 35 cents a share, beating analysts’ average estimate of 33 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 2.3 percent to $11.85 billion, while analysts expected $11.69 billion. It expects full-year profit of $1.37 to $1.40 a share, including charges of 20 cents a share associated with store closings and discontinued projects. “Although Lowe’s benefits from a relatively attractive valuation, we see limited upside potential from current levels based on our view of likely continued same-store sales underperformance vs. principal competitor Home Depot,” Citigroup analyst Kate McShane wrote.

46,HD,Home Depot outshines Lowe's again; ups outlook,"(Reuters) - Home Depot Inc (HD.N) raised its fiscal-year outlook for the third time in six months as a host of efforts to improve distribution and boost customer service helped the No. 1 home improvement chain gain share from archrival Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N). Home Depot, which reported stronger-than-expected quarterly results on Tuesday, also raised its quarterly dividend by 16 percent to 29 cents per share. The news came a day after Lowe’s also beat quarterly profit estimates and laid out a blueprint to win back shoppers from its larger competitor. Home Depot has benefited from more centralized distribution centers, better merchandising tools, efforts to shift more employees to jobs where they serve customers directly and the use of more technology in stores. The company has also been quicker to cut costs than Lowe’s, and in some cases has benefited as housing markets have improved in regions where it has a heavy presence. Home Depot has also gained from its slower expansion strategy. Under Chief Executive Frank Blake, Home Depot has been closing concept stores and upgrading service and products in its core retail business to win market share from Lowe’s. Blake, who became chairman and CEO in early 2007 after Robert Nardelli resigned, returned the company’s focus to being the regular big-box strip-mall type store and improving its merchandise, supply chain and customer service. “Overall, they are just out-executing Lowe’s at this point,” RBC Capital Markets Scot Ciccarelli said. “Lowe’s is trying to copy a lot of these same efforts that I think have helped Home Depot, but it is going to take a while for them to benefit from some of the changes that they are currently making.” Home Depot’s sales at stores open at least a year rose 4.2 percent globally, including a 3.8 percent rise in the United States. This was the 10th consecutive quarter that the company has outshone Lowe’s, whose same-store sales rose 0.7 percent in the quarter. Both chains got a lift from sales related to Hurricane Irene. The home improvement industry grew 2 percent in the 12 months ending September 2011, a report from market research firm NPD showed. However, the industry — pressured by the weak economy and housing market — is still down 7 percent compared with the same time period in 2009. “We still don’t see and we don’t expect to see in the near term any meaningful tailwind from the housing market,” Home Depot’s CEO said on Tuesday, echoing comments from Lowe’s CEO Robert Niblock earlier this week. Net income rose to $934 million, or 60 cents a share in the third quarter ended on October 30, from $834 million, or 51 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 58 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 4.4 percent to $17.33 billion, beating the analysts’ average estimate of $17.12 billion. For the current fiscal year, Home Depot sees earnings of $2.38 a share, up from its prior outlook of $2.34. It continues to expect sales to rise 2.5 percent in the period. The strong results from Home Depot coincided with a report from the Commerce Department that showed U.S. retail sales rose broadly in October, suggesting the economy started the fourth quarter with some strength. Home Depot shares, which had risen as much as 1.3 percent earlier on Tuesday, were down 8 cents at $38.17 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Shares of U.S. banks, which are sensitive to flare-ups in Europe’s debt crisis, were weak early. Citigroup Inc fell 1.7 percent to $27.88. A silver lining came in the form of stronger-than-expected retail sales in October and a report showing the New York manufacturing sector rose in November, ending five straight months of contraction. But Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channel Capital Research.com in Shrewsbury, New Jersey, said while the data were “OK but are not resounding,” investors were still focused on Europe. “It is what I call the elephant in the room,” he said. “What people are thinking about more than anything is what could trigger a major recession and dislocation, and that’s really Europe.” The Dow Jones industrial average rose 12.64 points, or 0.10 percent, at 12,091.62. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up 2.01 points, or 0.16 percent, at 1,253.79. The Nasdaq Composite Index put on 6.65 points, or 0.25 percent, at 2,663.87. When Italian bond yields rose above 7 percent last week, the S&P; 500 fell nearly 4 percent in one day. Heightened volatility has marked U.S. equities trading recently as investors fret about the debt crisis. In the latest earnings reports, Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s quarterly profit missed expectations as the economy continues to weigh on customers at its U.S. unit, its largest division. Its shares dropped 1.8 percent to $57.81.

49,HD,TEXT-S&P;:Lowe's downgraded to 'A-' on aggressive financial policy,"Nov 15- — Mooresville, N.C.-based Lowe’s financial policy has become more aggressive, a factor which we base on its announcement that it is relaxing its internal target leverage metric to 2.25x from 1.8x. — We expect the economy to remain weak over at least the next few quarters. — We are lowering all of the home improvement retailer’s ratings, including the corporate credit rating to ‘A-‘ from ‘A’ and the short-term rating to ‘A-2’ from ‘A-1’. — The negative outlook reflects the company’s willingness to continue to assume higher debt levels during a weak economic environment, and its under-performance relative to Home Depot . Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services said today that it lowered all of the long-term and short-term ratings on Lowe’s Cos. Inc., including the corporate credit rating to ‘A-‘ from ‘A’ and the short-term and commercial paper (CP) rating to ‘A-2’ from ‘A-1’. The outlook is negative. As of Oct. 28, 2011, Lowe’s had about $6.6 billion of debt outstanding. “The rating action reflects Lowe’s more aggressive financial policy, as signaled by the relaxation of its internal target leverage metric to 2.25x from 1.8x,” said Standard & Poor’s credit analyst Jerry Phelan. He explained, “We believe this will lead to commensurate weakening credit protection measures.” Lowe’s financial policy over the last two years has become more aggressive despite a deep economic downturn, fragile economic recovery, and an economy that could lapse back into recession. The ratings on Lowe’s reflect Standard & Poor’s opinion that the company should continue to report good profitability and free cash flow, despite the probability of significantly higher share repurchase activity, weaker credit measures, and our expectation for tough economic conditions. Our assessment that Lowe’s business risk profile will remain strong reflects its favorable No. 2 market position in the retail home improvement industry, overall satisfactory operating performance, and substantial cash flow generation, despite intense competition from its larger rival Home Depot Inc. Lowe’s intermediate financial risk profile is based on our belief that the company will reach its more aggressive 2.25x internal target leverage metric over the next 12 to 18 months. (We estimate Lowe’s 2.25x internal leverage metric is equal to about 2.3x under our lease-adjusted leverage calculations.) The negative outlook reflects the company’s willingness to continue to assume higher debt levels during a weak economic environment and its underperformance relative to Home Depot. We estimate total stock repurchases over the next year could reach $4.5 billion to $5 billion, including about $2.85 billion through debt-financing. We could lower the rating if we believe credit measures could deteriorate below our current expectations, due to a combination of meaningful debt-financed share repurchases and lower profitability associated with a protracted recession and an intensely competitive pricing environment. We could also consider a downgrade if Lowe’s financial policy becomes even more aggressive than we currently expect, including a further relaxation of its target leverage metric, a meaningful acquisition, or if leverage approaches 2.5x (based on our lease-adjusted calculations). We estimate this could occur if EBITDA falls by about 10% and Lowe’s uses all of its free cash flow, plus the proceeds from about $2.6 billion of debt issuances, to repurchase its common stock. We could revise the outlook to stable if Lowe’s comparable-store sales and profit performance begin to improve relative to market leader Home Depot, and if we become comfortable that the company will maintain its revised financial policy.

51,HD,Home Depot where 7 died in Joplin tornado reopens,"KANSAS CITY, Missouri (Reuters) - A Home Depot store in Joplin, Missouri, where seven people died in a tornado last spring reopened on Wednesday with a reinforced storm room for safety but a similar overall design to the one that did not withstand the giant twister. Home Depot was among several large stores destroyed in the May 22 EF-5 rated tornado that took 161 lives and destroyed about 8,000 homes and other buildings in Joplin. The store began operating out of a tent in the month after the tornado, serving a demand for construction and other materials in the cleanup and rebuilding of Joplin. Store manager Steve Cope said the new store is a step forward for Joplin. “We are ecstatic,” he said Wednesday. “This is another piece of Joplin being rebuilt.” On May 22, Cope arrived at the store 20 minutes after the tornado. Outer walls and much of the roof collapsed, killing one employee and six other people. The new store will have a reinforced room in the event of another tornado, but it is not a designated storm shelter, said Stephen Holmes, spokesman at Home Depot’s corporate office. The old store was built with what is called tilt-up construction in which large concrete slabs are pre-made and then lifted up to form walls. Larry Tanner, a civil engineering research associate at Texas Tech University who helped examine the Joplin storm damage for the federal government, has said that big box stores were vulnerable to failure during the storm, even though they were built to code. Home Depot officials stressed the buildings were built to code rules that states they must withstand winds of 90 mph. The May tornado packed winds more than twice that strong. The new store also uses tilt-up construction, with walls poured off-site and then brought in. That doesn’t affect their strength, Holmes said. The Tilt-Up Concrete Association, which defends the construction practice as safe, appointed a task force to study the damage to the Home Depot in Joplin, according to the association website. Its findings and recommendations are to be released soon. The new store will have a memorial in front, with benches and a plaque in memory of the people who died on May 22.

That report raised hopes that the housing market was stabilizing. Tuesday’s news drove Home Depot shares to their highest level since May 2002 and made some analysts more optimistic about the retailer’s prospects. Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter said the most important part of Home Depot’s strong performance and earnings beat were that “they are occurring prior to any sustained housing recovery.” The company’s earnings power will rise significantly once the housing market and the economy improve, Balter added. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Earnings graphic: link.reuters.com/ryb76s ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> Besides the warm winter, Home Depot benefited from having more centralized distribution centers and from recent efforts to shift more employees to jobs where they serve customers directly.

57,HD,"Factory, income data support growth outlook","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The economy grew slightly faster than initially thought in the fourth quarter and a gauge of factory activity in the Midwest hit a 10 month-high in February, pointing to underlying strength in the economy. Gross domestic product expanded at a 3 percent annual rate, the quickest pace since the second quarter of 2010, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday in its second estimate. The reading, which was up from the 2.8 percent pace the government reported last month and reflected modest upward revisions to almost all components of GDP, added to the recent run of fairly upbeat economic reports. The tone of the GDP report was further bolstered by upward revisions to income and savings data, which should help support consumer spending in the face of rising gasoline prices. “Growth is still on the right path, but we are not going to see any acceleration. Income was revised up so it removed one of the headwinds to growth in the beginning of the year,” said Yelena Shulyatyeva, an economist at BNP Paribas in New York. A steady stream of fairly upbeat data ranging from employment to manufacturing has caused analysts to temper expectations of a sharp pullback in growth this quarter. First-quarter GDP growth is seen between 2 and 2.5 percent. In another report, the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago said its measure of manufacturing in the Midwest region rose to a 10-month high of 64 in February from 60.2 in January. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the regional economy. Activity was boosted by a jump in new orders to a near one-year high and a backlog build-up. The report, which also showed regional factory employment at its highest since May 1984, was in stark contrast with a sharp decline in demand for long-lasting manufactured goods in January reported by the government on Tuesday. “Durable goods orders are usually weaker in the first month of the quarter and that is particularly noticeable in January. Manufacturing is doing well,” said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody’s Analytics in West Chester Pennsylvania. Economists have raised their forecasts for the Institute for Supply Management’s report on overall manufacturing activity to be released on Thursday. The ISM index of national manufacturing is now expected to be around 55, up from the 54.5 forecast in a Reuters poll. Stocks on Wall Street initially rose on the data, but reversed gains to end lower amid disappointment that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke gave no signal for further monetary stimulus. But prices of Treasury debt, a traditional safe haven, fell on the signs of economic improvement. The dollar rose 0.7 percent against a basket of currencies. Better economic data has reduced expectations that the Fed will ease monetary policy further by launching a third round of asset purchases, or quantitative easing, in order to drive down long-term interest rates and help boost economic activity. Chairman Bernanke, in semi-annual testimony to Congress on Wednesday, offered no hints as to whether the U.S. central bank would undertake more bond purchases, but he said the labor market was far from normal. “Continued improvement ... is likely to require stronger growth in final demand and production,” he said. While data so far this year has been relatively upbeat, some of the gains reflect unseasonably warm weather. Analysts are watching gasoline prices, which early last year contributed to a softening in the economy that nearly pushed it back into recession. Retail gas prices have jumped 12.6 percent, or 42 cents a gallon, since the start of the year and averaged $3.78 a gallon in the week through Monday. “The economy is heading in the right direction, but it’s not off and running yet. Even though job growth is accelerating, long-term unemployment is a major problem,” said Sweet. A report from the Fed showed the economy expanded modestly in January through mid-February as hiring picked up a bit across several districts. Recent employment gains are helping the economy. The GDP report showed consumer spending - which accounts for about 70 percent of U.S. economic activity - grew at a 2.1 percent rate in the fourth quarter, revised up from 2 percent. Real disposable income growth was revised up to a 1.4 percent rate from 0.8 percent. The saving rate was raised to a much stronger 4.5 percent rate from 3.7 percent. There were also modest upward revisions to business investment in capital goods and spending on home building. Investment in nonresidential structures was modestly weak. Still, the pace of business spending was the slowest since the 2007-09 recession ended. While a rebuilding of inventories added a hefty 1.88 percentage points to GDP in the last quarter, the increase was revised down to $54.3 billion from $56.0 billion. “The large boost to GDP growth from stock building in the fourth quarter is unlikely to be repeated in the first quarter, but the household accounts provide a much more encouraging backdrop for consumer spending,” said Peter Newland, a senior economist at Barclays Capital. Excluding inventories, the economy grew at a 1.1 percent rate, up from the 0.8 percent rate initially reported, but a sharp step-down from the third quarter’s 3.2 percent pace. The report also showed exports were not as strong as previously thought, but imports were not robust, leaving a smaller trade gap that was less of a drag on growth. Government spending was weak, hurt by a steep decline in defense outlays. Inflation pressures toward the end of the year were slightly elevated, instead of subsiding as the first report had said. A price index for personal spending rose at a 1.2 percent rate instead of 0.7 percent. A core measure that strips out food and energy costs rose at a 1.3 percent rate instead of 1.1 percent. The Fed would prefer to see this measure nearer its 2 percent inflation target.

58,HD,"Amid signs of recovery, caution is still key","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Call it spring fever. For the third year in a row, optimism is spreading that growth in the United States could be poised to accelerate and drive the economy into sunnier pastures. Claims for first-time jobless benefits dipped to a four-year low last week as layoffs slow. Factory output is steadily expanding. Retail sales have picked up the past two months. And Europe no longer looms as an immediate threat since Greece restructured its debt and won more bailout money. Even a 9 percent surge in gasoline prices on tensions with Iran over its nuclear program has failed to take much shine off consumer confidence. The University of Michigan survey slipped by one point to 74.3 in early March, but views on current conditions edged upward. “For now it’s a Goldilocks scenario — moderate GDP growth, an improving jobs market, only a temporary inflation scare,” said Greg Valliere, chief strategist at the Potomac Research Group. That is a marked improvement from five months ago when the prospect of a Greek sovereign chaotic default loomed large and running battles over the U.S. budget deficit damaged business and consumer confidence. Economists last October put the risk of the United States sliding back into recession at 30 percent. No one is talking recession these days. The talk now is more about sustainable recovery, and investors are betting the world economy has turned the corner. Investors poured into stocks last week, shedding safe-haven U.S. and German government debt, and the VIX .VIX, an index that tracks U.S. stock market volatility and is know as Wall Street’s fear gauge, hit its lowest level since the summer of 2007 when the financial crisis began. “All things considered, I think we are doing pretty well,” former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker told an economics summit here last week. But bursts of optimism have sown false hope before. This time last year, the U.S. economy was adding jobs at a similar pace of more than 200,000 a month between February and April. Growth was nipped in the bud by the Arab uprising, which sent oil prices soaring, and took another blow when Japan’s massive earthquake disrupted the global manufacturing chain. First-quarter output in 2011 was a paltry 0.4 percent and 1.7 percent in the second quarter. In 2010, prospects had looked even stronger. Between March and May, companies were adding a net 309,000 new jobs each month, and first-quarter growth came in at a 2.7 percent. The rebound proved temporary, largely driven by companies rebuilding inventory after the steepest recession in over 70 years. Today there is a cautious hope that perhaps this time it’s different. American households have lowered their debt levels and are starting to borrow again. Durable goods are wearing out and demand picking up. Salaries are rising for the highest two income groups, which support 60 percent of all U.S. consumer spending — itself the biggest driver of the country’s economy. Europe’s downturn is looking less severe than feared, and while China’s outlook remains uncertain and its housing market overheated, officials there could yet pull off a soft landing. “I am very cautious about the outlook, partly because we got burned last year. But make no mistake, we are getting better numbers here, and there is an upside scenario where we could get a lot of good growth,” said Craig Alexander, chief economist at TD Bank Financial Group in Toronto. The euro zone gets an early look at its factory and service sector for March on Thursday. Economists forecast the flash PMI index will show gradual improvement though they see it remaining a little below the 50 mark, which divides growth from contraction. One reason for caution is that many risks still loom. Some are persistent problems left over from the financial crisis that will exert a drag for months to come. In the housing market, a flood of foreclosures continue to weigh on house prices this year. Housing starts for February, to be released on Tuesday, and new home sales on Friday are seen little changed at 700,000 units and 325,000, respectively. The home builders index also is forecast to hold steady around 30. Existing home sales, due out on Wednesday, are forecast to rise by 1.1 percent, down from January’s strong 4.3 percent showing. For all its gains, the labor market remains relatively weak. Job growth in this recovery is the slowest since World War Two, and 250,000 to 300,000 new positions would have to be added each month before the 8.3 percent jobless rate would decline substantially. The longer people are out of work, the faster they lose skills, and long-term unemployment is becoming an increasing worry. While Europe’s sovereign debt crisis has abated, it could easily reignite, possibly as soon as this summer. The International Monetary Fund warned on Friday Greece has no room for error. Portugal and Spain are struggling to meet tough budget goals, and European leaders have yet to agree on putting more money into its rescue fund. Politics also threaten. A military strike against Iran, favored by Israel, would send oil prices sky rocketing and upend growth. In the United States, U.S. fiscal contraction threatens when tax cuts worth about $300 billion-$400 billion expire at year end and budget cuts kick in, creating what analysts call a massive fiscal cliff unless lawmakers decide to delay the measures. “You have got a 4 to 5 percent hit to GDP and growth already is going to be moderate at best,” said Robert Rubin, former Citigroup chairman and U.S. Treasury Secretary in the Clinton administration. “It has enormous, enormous consequences for the economy.” ",3182012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-economy-global-weekahead/amid-signs-of-recovery-caution-is-still-key-idUSBRE82H0AP20120318
59,HD,UPDATE 1-Chinese light-bulb maker TCP International files for U.S. IPO,"March 26 (Reuters) - Chinese light bulb maker TCP International Holdings Inc filed with U.S. regulators on Monday to raise up to $100 million in an initial public offering of its common stock. The Shanghai-based company, which makes energy-efficient bulbs and sells to Home Depot Inc, Wal-Mart Stores Inc  and Homebase Group in the United States, said Jefferies, Citigroup, Piper Jaffray and KeyBanc Capital Markets would underwrite its IPO. Home Depot accounted for 33 percent of the company’s sales in 2011, according to TCP’s filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The filing did not mention the number of shares being sold in the offering, or the exchange the stock would list on. In its section about the risks it faces, TCP said it has “material weaknesses” in its internal controls over financial accounting. Listed Chinese companies have faced a number of problems over accounting issues, and many investors have shunned them in the aftermath of the scandals. Last week, Vipshop, a Chinese online retailer, made a dismal debut on the New York Stock Exchange, making it the first Chinese company to go public since August last year. TCP also makes use of a complicated corporate structure called a ‘variable interest entity’ or VIE, which lets Chinese companies bend certain rules forbidding foreign investment.

60,HD,Durable goods orders hint at weak first quarter,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for long-lasting U.S. factory goods increased only modestly in February, supporting the view that economic growth in the first quarter could be lackluster. Durable goods orders rose 2.2 percent last month, missing economists’ forecasts and only partially reversing January’s sharp decline, Commerce Department data showed on Wednesday. A gauge of future business investment also fell short of forecasts. “The economy is slowly improving, but it is definitely a halting recovery where we’re not accelerating to any great degree,” said Liam Dalton, president of Axiom Capital Management in New York. Manufacturing has been a key support for the United States’ recovery from the 2007-2009 recession, and a recent acceleration in job growth has boosted hopes that extra income will create a virtuous cycle that leads to more spending. But economists have also been puzzled by a steep fall in the unemployment rate given generally weak economic growth. The jobless rate has dropped to 8.3 percent from 9.1 percent in August. U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Monday that growth probably needs to pick up for the unemployment rate to fall further. He reinforced his point on Tuesday, saying it was too soon to declare victory in the recovery and declining to rule out further action to spur stronger growth. The durable goods data backs the view that growth will slow in the first quarter to around a 2-percent annual rate, said Capital Economics economist Paul Ashworth. That pace would generally be seen as too weak to lower unemployment. Business executives, however, are feeling more optimistic. A survey released by the Business Roundtable on Wednesday showed U.S. chief executives’ economic outlook brightened in the first quarter, with a growing number planning to hire more workers and invest more in capital equipment. In the fourth quarter, efforts by companies to restock shelves helped gross domestic product expand at a 3.0 percent annual rate. As the impetus from restocking fades, factory output will slip absent a pick-up in orders. The durables goods data suggested the factory sector might not be growing as fast as analysts expected. U.S. stocks fell after the data, and U.S. government debt prices were little changed. Economists expected orders for durable goods, which are items from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, to rise 3.0 percent in February. Excluding transportation-related items, orders climbed 1.6 percent. Orders for non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for future business investment, edged 1.2 percent higher, missing analysts’ expectations of a 2.0 percent gain. They fell 3.7 percent in January. A 3.9 percent increase in bookings for transportation equipment in February, including a 6.0 percent jump in civilian aircraft orders, helped drive overall orders higher. Boeing received 237 orders for aircraft during the month, according to the plane maker’s website, up from 150 in January. In a separate report, the Mortgage Bankers Association said its gauge of loan requests for home purchases rose 3.3 percent in the week ended March 23, the latest sign of rekindling activity in the housing market. Weakness in housing has been a major drag on the recovery since a bubble in home prices popped and triggered a financial crisis. The increase in home loan applications came despite fixed 30-year mortgage rates rising to their highest level since November.

61,HD,"Fourth quarter income trends up, boost for spending","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Household income grew at a faster pace in the fourth quarter than previously thought as the jobs market strengthened, a development that could underpin consumer spending. The Commerce Department said on Thursday real disposable income rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $11.73 trillion, $10.6 billion more than previously estimated. While its final estimate left growth in gross domestic product at an unrevised 3 percent pace last quarter, when measured from the income side, the economy expanded at a solid 4.4 percent rate - the quickest since the first quarter of 2010. “That may indicate that there is a little more strength out there in the economy than what the GDP numbers would indicate,” said Gus Faucher, a senior economist at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh. Economists said the strong rise in gross domestic income, which followed a 2.6 percent advance in the third quarter, reflected stepped-up hiring. The firming labor market tone was underscored by a separate report from the Labor Department showing the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits eased to 359,000 last week, the lowest level in nearly four years. Initial claims have trended lower for much of March, raising hopes of a fourth straight month of nonfarm payrolls gains above 200,000. The government will release its closely followed employment report on April 6. “The labor market and job creation appears to have strengthened significantly in the first quarter of the year,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. Economists said the strengthening in income growth better explained the quickened pace of hiring seen in recent months than the more tepid increase in GDP, which they said could be understating the economy’s vigor. “GDI supports our view that recent GDP readings are too low and will be revised upward, consistent with the improvement in the unemployment rate over the past year,” said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody’s Analytics in West Chester Pennsylvania. While GDP and gross domestic income estimates for a given quarter may differ because they are calculated using different data, over time, they tend to follow similar patterns of change. With companies hiring more workers, profit growth slowed to a 0.9 percent rate in the fourth quarter, the smallest increase in three years, from 1.7 percent the prior quarter. Graphic - U.S. jobless claims: link.reuters.com/puf47s Graphic - U.S. GDP: link.reuters.com/wuf47s SLOWER FIRST-QUARTER GROWTH While GDP grew solidly in the final three months of 2011, momentum appears to have slowed this quarter with signs of cooling in manufacturing and business spending and a pause in the housing market recovery. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Monday that growth needed to accelerate to bring the unemployment rate down further. While he offered no sign the U.S. central bank would launch a third round of bond purchases to spur faster growth, Bernanke said on Tuesday all options remained on the table. Growth is seen slowing to around 2 percent in the first quarter as the impetus from a restocking by businesses fades. Rising gasoline prices, which act as a tax on consumers, present a wild card. So far there is little sign consumers have cut back, with auto sales surging in both January and February. The gains in incomes should provide a cushion against the pain at the pump. Spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of U.S. economic activity, grew at a 2.1 percent pace in the fourth quarter, up from 1.7 percent in the prior three months. Consumer spending data for February due for release on Friday could offer fresh clues on the health of the consumer. Spending was flat in January for the third straight month, when adjusted for inflation. The build-up in business inventories accounted for the bulk of the rise in fourth-quarter output, although slightly less than previously believed. Excluding inventories, the economy grew at an unrevised 1.1 percent rate. That was a sharp step-down from the prior period’s 3.2 percent pace. Business spending was revised up to a 5.2 percent growth rate from 2.8 percent, offsetting weaker export growth.

62,HD,"Consumer spending jumps, GDP prospects brighten","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending increased by the most in seven months in February as households shook off a rise in gasoline prices, leading economists to raise forecasts for first-quarter growth. Even with gasoline around $4 a gallon, Americans were more optimistic about the economy’s prospects this month than at any other time over the past year, drawing solace from a firming labor market. The Commerce Department said on Friday that consumer spending rose 0.8 percent in February as demand for long-lasting goods, like automobiles, rose sharply. It also said spending in January was double the previously reported 0.2 percent gain. Separately, the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan’s final March reading for the overall consumer sentiment index rose to 76.2, the highest level since February 2011, from 75.3 in February. “Fears that the economy was going to slow substantially this quarter were overdone. The economy is doing fairly well, given the headwinds from Europe, rising gasoline prices,” said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody’s Analytics in West Chester Pennsylvania. U.S. stocks rose on the spending and sentiment reports, which were both stronger than expected, while U.S. Treasury debt prices were little changed. The dollar fell against a basket of major currencies. With confidence holding up, consumer spending should remain supported in the first half of the year and soften the impact of cooling factory activity on the economy, analysts said. FIRST-QUARTER GDP FORECASTS RAISED When adjusted for inflation, spending advanced 0.5 percent, the largest gain since September. That prompted several economists, including those at Goldman Sachs to raise their first-quarter GDP forecasts. Goldman Sachs now expects GDP to rise at a 2.3 percent annual rate in the first quarter, up from 2 percent. The economy expanded at a 3 percent pace in the final three months of 2011 as it got a boost from restocking by businesses, but the inventory buildup has likely pretty much run its course and is not expected to help this quarter. The growth in factory activity in the U.S. Midwest slowed in March, another report showed on Friday, with employment and new orders pulling back from recent lofty levels. The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago’s business barometer slipped to 62.2 from 64.0 in February. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the regional economy. Last month’s increase in consumer spending suggested households were taking surging gasoline prices in stride. Prices at the pump averaged $3.97 a gallon in the week to Monday and have risen 62 cents since the start of the year. Earlier this week, Wal-Mart Stores said U.S. sales in the last two months had withstood rising gas prices and a tough economy that worried many of its shoppers. Economists said the pain at the pump was being mitigated by falling natural gas prices, which have been depressed by abnormally warm weather that has curbed demand for heating. A modest 0.2 percent rise in income helped cover some of the rise in spending last month, but consumers also saved less. The saving rate, the amount of disposable income socked away, dropped to 3.7 percent, the lowest rate since August 2009. Disposable income, that amount left after taxes and inflation, declined for a second straight month, a worrying trend that could eventually put the brakes on spending. “While households want to spend and will raid their bank accounts to support that habit, unless income gains start improving, consumption will have to slow,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. Spending on goods meant to last three years or more rose 1.6 percent after advancing 1.4 percent the prior month, a reflection of a pickup in auto sales, which reached their highest level in four years in February. Spending on services, which accounts for about two thirds of consumption, notched its strongest gain in nearly two years. Despite rising gasoline costs, inflation was largely contained. A price index for personal spending rose 0.3 percent in February after increasing 0.2 percent the prior month. In the 12 months through February, the so-called PCE price index was up 2.3 percent. It increased 2.4 percent in January. A core inflation measure, which strips out food and energy costs, edged up 0.1 percent after rising 0.2 percent in January. In the 12 months through February, core prices rose 1.9 percent, the same as in January.

63,HD,Home Depot sales miss Wall Street estimates,"(Reuters) - Home Depot Inc posted quarterly sales that fell short of Wall Street’s heightened expectations on Tuesday after demand slowed in April following a jump in home improvement projects spurred by an unusually warm winter. But results were stronger than the company expected, as the warm weather pushed forward a significant amount of sales that would have normally occurred in the second quarter. And despite recent encouraging signs about the U.S. housing market, the company said it has not fully recovered from the housing crash. “Adjusting for weather impacts and the pull-forward of activity, the quarter’s results were encouraging and consistent with our view that growth this year will be reflective of broad GDP growth, rather than a recovery in the housing market,” said Home Depot Chief Executive Frank Blake on a conference call. Spring is traditionally the biggest selling season of the year for home improvement chains. But this year, customers began projects early, the company said. That fueled investor optimism which lifted sales expectations past the company’s own outlook. Home Depot’s sales rose 5.9 percent to $17.81 billion in the first quarter ended on April 29, missing analysts’ average estimate of $17.96 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Same-store sales, or sales open at least a year, rose 5.8 percent globally, and 6.1 percent in the United States. After the unusually warm weather in February and March, Wall Street analysts were looking for a global same-store sales rise of 6.5 percent in the quarter, Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel said. “A 5.8 percent increase in (same-store) sales is a very good number, but expectations are the name of the game, and they had gotten a little high,” said Edward Jones analyst Robin Diedrich. Home Depot shares, which had gained more than 18 percent this year through Monday, were down 1.7 percent in midday trade. Home Depot estimated that weather lifted U.S. same-store sales by 3 percentage points, with as much as a third of that being sales that would have otherwise occurred during the second quarter. The company said second-quarter same-store sales growth should be lower than the first quarter. The average transaction price at Home Depot rose 2.2 percent to $54.51 in the quarter. Same-store sales rose 6.2 percent in February, 6 percent in March and 5.4 percent in April. The U.S. market saw a similar slowdown in April, rising only 5.6 percent, after gains of 7.2 percent in February and 5.8 percent in March. The lower-than-expected sales at Home Depot caused JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers to lower his sales estimates for smaller rival Lowe’s, to 4 percent growth from a prior estimate of 5 percent growth. Lowe’s plans to report quarterly results next week. Home Depot saw strength in seasonal products like lawn mowers, grills and planters, while plumbing and kitchen supplies were weaker. The company’s net earnings rose to $1.04 billion, or 68 cents a share, from $812 million, or 50 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding items, Home Depot earned 65 cents a share, meeting analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Home Depot was quicker to cut costs than rival Lowe’s, and has benefited as housing demand picks up in regions where it has a heavy presence. It has also gained from opening more centralized distribution facilities. The company expects sales to pick up later in the year. It sees fiscal-year sales rising about 4.6 percent, up from its prior outlook calling for a 4 percent increase. It raised its profit outlook for the year to $2.90 a share from a prior forecast of $2.79 a share. The outlook implies a 1 percent to 2 percent rise in same-store sales for the rest of the year, which is probably conservative, UBS analyst Michael Lasser said.

66,HD,Lowe's cuts profit outlook as demand weakens,"(Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N), the world’s No. 2 home improvement chain, cut its fiscal-year earnings outlook and said demand slowed toward the end of the traditionally strong first quarter, sending its shares down nearly 10 percent. The lackluster forecast came just days after larger rival Home Depot Inc (HD.N) missed Wall Street’s quarterly sales estimates as demand weakened in April following a jump in home improvement projects earlier in the year because of a warm winter. “While we capitalized on better-than-anticipated weather during most of the quarter, demand for seasonal products slowed toward the end,” Lowe’s CEO Robert Niblock said on Monday. In addition to demand being pulled forward, April sales were hurt by Lowe’s decision to offer fewer discounts on expensive items like appliances. That is in sync with the retailer’s bigger plan to move away from promotions to offering everyday low prices. “Clearly there will be some disruption in the process of going to this strategy,” Niblock told Reuters. “Consumers are conditioned to look for a discount.” Niblock sees the disruption as temporary and expects more shoppers to come into stores once it establishes itself as a retailer offering competitive prices. Lowe’s will still offer discounts during key seasons and give additional discounts to shoppers using Lowe’s credit cards. Sales at Lowe’s stores open at least a year rose 2.6 percent, including a 2.7 percent increase for the U.S. business, making it the 12th straight quarter when it trailed Home Depot Inc (HD.N) in same-store sales. The results from both home improvement chains also reflected the state of the housing market, analysts said. While the housing market has started stabilizing after years of weakness, “things are not terrific in this space,” analyst Alan Rifkin at Barclays said. The 2.6 percent rise in same-store sales also fell short of many analysts’ estimates. Rifkin was looking for a 4 percent increase. Lowe’s shares slid about 10 percent to $25.70, while Home Depot shares recovered from earlier losses to trade up 1 percent at $47.53 on Monday. Spring is traditionally the biggest selling season of the year for home improvement chains. But this year, homeowners stepped out earlier than usual to take advantage of the unseasonably warm winter weather across the United States. Lowe’s, which maintained a “cautious view of the housing and macro demand environment,” sees earnings of $1.73 to $1.83 a share for the year ending February 1. It earlier forecast $1.75 to $1.85 a share. Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Fassler called Lowe’s outlook “disappointing,” especially since the company exceeded profit estimates in the first quarter. “My biggest concern about the sector is the underlying demand dynamics,” Fassler said. He has a “buy” rating on Lowe’s and a “neutral” rating on Home Depot. Rifkin said he preferred Home Depot over Lowe’s, citing the larger rival’s efforts to control costs. STORE-LEVEL CHANGES Lowe’s sales rose 7.9 percent to $13.15 billion in the first quarter ended May 4, while analysts, on average, expected $12.99 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net earnings rose to $527 million, or 43 cents a share, from $461 million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding a charge for a previously announced cut in U.S. headquarters staff, the retailer earned 44 cents per share, compared with Wall Street’s estimate of 42 cents. Lowe’s, which runs 1,747 stores in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, continues to expect total sales to rise 1 percent to 2 percent for the fiscal year, with an increase of 1 percent to 3 percent in sales at stores open at least a year.

67,HD,Justin Bieber suffers concussion in Paris,"(Reuters) - Canadian pop star Justin Bieber ran headlong into trouble on a European promotional tour on Thursday, knocking himself out backstage in Paris and dealing with a crushing crowd in Norway that left some fans injured one day earlier. Thursday’s incident occurred after the singer fell into a glass wall during an intimate concert in Paris. Bieber told celebrity news website TMZ.com he felt lightheaded but was able to perform his last song before going backstage and passing out for 15 seconds. TMZ posted an audio clip of its conversation with the pop sensation in which he said doctors told him he suffered a concussion and ordered him to relax. The singer quickly posted on Twitter that he was doing well, joking about the incident and saying “gotta laugh at yourself sometimes.” The concussion comes one day after Bieber, on a brief tour of major European cities to promote upcoming album “Believe,” was met with a crush of fans before a free concert in Oslo leading to reports of dozens of young girls being injured. Bieber’s record label, Universal Music, said in a statement to celebrity site E! Online on Thursday that it “regrets strongly that some of those who were Justin concert had a bad experience.” A label executive said “fortunately no one was seriously injured,” and added that Bieber wanted to return to Norway and perform a future concert there. Calls and e-mails to Bieber’s representatives were not immediately returned. Bieber performed a free, six-song concert at the Oslo Opera House on Wednesday that is planned to be featured on his upcoming one-hour NBC television special to be aired next month. The 18-year-old singer was forced to tweet a safety message ahead of the show after police were unable to control the crowds of fans trying to catch a glimpse of the star. “for the show to happen u must all listen to the police. we are all concerned for your safety and i want what is best for u. please listen,” Bieber posted to his 22 million Twitter followers on Wednesday. TMZ said 49 young girls were injured and 14 taken to hospitals, and police came close to declaring a state of emergency in the capital. Those reports could not be immediately confirmed. This is not the first time Bieber fever has caused crowd control and safety issues. In November 2009, fans stampeded a shopping mall in Long Island, New York ahead of an appearance by the pop star, forcing organizers to cancel the event. Bieber’s manager was charged with reckless endangerment and criminal nuisance, but the charges were later dropped.

70,HD,"Consumers gloomier on jobs, finances","NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Consumer sentiment cooled again in early July to its lowest level in seven months as Americans took a dim view of their finances and job prospects, a survey released on Friday showed. Separately, producer prices rose only slightly last month as energy costs dropped, suggesting inflation pressures remain muted and leaving the door open for more efforts to stimulate the economy by the Federal Reserve. Consumer sentiment eroded for the second month in a row after a streak of gains that started in September and Americans’ attitudes about their financial situations for the coming year reached an all-time low. Analysts said that while the drop in the main index was disappointing, attitudes were still not as dire as last summer when fears of an imminent recession were high. At the same time, however, “The lack of a rebound, despite some help from lower gasoline prices and a modest bounce in equities in the past month, raises the specter of growth remaining stuck at a low level for a while,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan’s preliminary reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment fell to 72.0 from 73.2 in June, frustrating economists’ expectations for a slight gain to 73.4. It was the lowest level since December 2011. Worries about the strength of the global economy have grown of late, along with concerns the euro zone debt crisis is taking its toll. After growing at a 1.9 percent annual rate in the first quarter, the U.S. economy is not expected to have done much better in the second quarter. Only 19 percent of consumers expected to be financially better off in the coming year, the lowest proportion ever recorded by the survey. Americans were also gloomy about their longer-term prospects, with 39 percent anticipating their situation would be better in five years. “You can’t get overly concerned at the moment, but it’s just an indication that the average household is pretty queasy about the current state of play and the U.S. economy,” said Cary Leahey, managing director and economist at Decision Economics. The gauge of consumer expectations slipped to 64.8 from 67.8, also the lowest since December. While there was widespread recognition of an economic slowdown, that did not have a large impact on consumers’ view of their present situation, and the barometer of current economic conditions rose to 83.2 from 81.5. Still, news of job losses was mentioned twice as frequently as job gains, the opposite of the first six months of the year. “The greatest concern to consumers is that wage and job growth will remain depressed over the foreseeable future, and that these meager gains are likely to be further diminished in the years ahead by rising taxes and benefit cutbacks,” survey director Richard Curtin said. Financial markets had little reaction to the data. U.S. stocks rose more than 1 percent in late morning trading as data from China allayed concerns a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy would further hinder growth worldwide. While China’s growth rate slowed to 7.6 percent, it was better than some in the market had feared and left the door open for more stimulus. The Labor Department said on Friday seasonally adjusted producer prices rose 0.1 percent last month. Analysts polled by Reuters expected the index to drop 0.5 percent. “The modest 0.1 percent increase in U.S. producer prices in June is another illustration that the Fed doesn’t need to worry about inflation, at least not in the near-term,” said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. While wholesale prices of finished goods rose, costs for intermediate and crude goods fell, suggesting less inflation pressure down the road. Energy prices dropped 0.9 percent in June, dragged down by a record drop in prices for residential electric power, which fell 2.1 percent. Diesel fuel prices sank 8.8 percent. Higher food and gasoline prices took analysts by surprise, with gasoline prices up 1.9 percent. However, declines in prices for less-refined petroleum products, which go into making gasoline, pointed to softer costs ahead for gasoline. Cheaper energy prices are likely to help the economy as lower costs for fuels and other input prices leave companies with more money to spend on other things, such as equipment or even hiring. Planned spending cuts and tax hikes next year could send the U.S. economy into recession, but the survey showed consumers are not yet overly worried about the so-called “fiscal cliff,” with Americans expecting Congress will take action to avert a sharp tightening in policy. But confidence in government economic policies remained near all-time lows at 11 percent. So-called core inflation, which strips out more volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.2 percent, in line with expectations, the Labor Department data showed. While overall inflation has cooled recently, core inflation has held at higher levels. Some policymakers at the Fed worry that further moves to lower borrowing costs could fuel higher inflation, though the central bank has said it was ready to do more to help the economy if needed. The Fed holds its next meeting at the end of the month, while Chairman Ben Bernanke will be delivering remarks to Congress next week. Americans’ inflation expectations stayed in check in July. The University of Michigan survey showed consumers’ one-year inflation expectation falling to its lowest level since October 2010 at 2.8 percent from 3.1 percent. The five-to-10-year inflation outlook held steady at 2.8 percent. In another sign of the impact of the debt crisis in the euro zone, printer maker Lexmark-International Inc cut its second-quarter outlook, hurt by the impact of exchange rates and weaker-than-expected demand in Europe.

71,HD,Analysis: Rona looks outside the big box for a turnaround,"BOUCHERVILLE, Quebec (Reuters) - Rona Inc, Canada’s home-grown answer to Home Depot Inc and Lowe’s Cos Inc, has built its turnaround plan around a bold theory: the golden age of the big box store is ending. For years, Rona organized its business around cracking the big box market. Now, facing sluggish consumer confidence and smarting from falling sales at established stores, it is closing or splitting up 23 of its 79 biggest outlets. Luc Rodier, Rona’s executive vice president for retail, says the novelty and excitement of bigger formats has worn off for consumers, and the performance of Rona’s smaller stores shows customers want to shop in smaller outlets, closer to home. Under a strategic plan announced in February, Rona is opening more “satellite” and “proximity” outlets that run 5,000 to 35,000 square feet, rather than the 100,000 square feet-plus found at most big boxes. “A nice 100,000 square feet at peak season, it’s phenomenal. At low season, it’s a big box,” Rodier says. “It’s a big building.” He says shoppers can get lost in such a big space, and that’s a turn-off. “I can put 60, 70 people on the floor and you’ll say, there’s nobody here - when we know that our customers are looking for expertise and service.” At stake is Rona’s slender lead over Home Depot in Canada. According to its own data, last year it still held the largest share of the hardware and home improvement market at 19 percent, ahead of Home Depot’s 16 percent. To be sure, the notion that the big box store is losing favor with consumer is counterintuitive, and some analysts question the logic, especially as retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc open more mega-stores in Canada. That said, the fresh emphasis on smaller stores may be smart for Rona regardless of why the chain is making the move. “It’s just a function of Canada becoming increasingly saturated,” says National Bank financial analyst Vishal Shreedhar. “You have to go into smaller markets where you need smaller stores, and sometimes you target pockets of markets, in which case you would need a smaller store.” Indeed, Shreedhar is not rejecting Rona’s plan out of hand: “Rona is trying to target niches of the market in which it believes it can perform better.” The smaller-store strategy is a big change for Rona, which kicked off its transformation from modest Quebec hardware distributor to national retailer in the 1990s to compete as Home Depot and major competitors arrived in Canada. The company was founded in 1939 by independent hardware stores in Quebec keen to ditch their powerful wholesalers, and quickly gathered more members. Many dealers were family-run businesses or small chains. Its corporate offices in Boucherville, Quebec, near Montreal are dwarfed by a nearly kilometer-long warehouse, a legacy of the company’s beginnings as a distributor. By the early 1990s, Home Depot’s orange boxes dotted the United States, and management concluded that Rona had to grow to survive. It teamed up with a group of dealers to open its first sprawling store in Laval, north of Montreal, in 1994, the year Home Depot arrived in Canada. A string of acquisitions - Cashway, Western Canada’s Revy Home Centres, Alberta’s Totem - brought in Rona’s first corporate stores, made it a national player, and took sales from C$707.1 million ($700 million) in 1997 to C$4.55 billion in 2006. The timing was right: the economy was powering ahead, and Rona’s customers were spending freely on home renovations. The stock consistently traded above C$20 from 2005 to late 2007. Then the recession hit. Rona’s sales in established stores, trending lower from the fourth quarter of 2007, rose in late 2009, thanks to a government home renovation tax credit. But same-store sales slumped again in 2010, as the tax credit expired. Home Depot and Lowe’s were, of course, also hit by the recession. Since neither company breaks out Canadian results, it is difficult to compare their recent results to Rona’s. But in its last two reported quarters, Home Depot said same-store sales rose in Canada. Home Depot has 180 locations in Canada, while Rona operates a network of nearly 800 outlets and supplies almost 1,500, most smaller than the average Home Depot. Lowe’s, which did not enter the market until 2007, had 31 stores at the beginning of April. In April, Rona’s shares jumped after the chief financial officer of Lowe’s said it was a “very interesting company,” and that Lowe’s was open to all options should Rona put itself up for sale. Since then, Rona has said repeatedly that it is not for sale. Rodier says small dealers inspired Rona’s strategic shift as the company’s research showed that customers were picking stores close to home as the recession ended. With more, smaller locations, management reasoned, Rona could reach more of them. “We took the decision to get out of the box in some markets,” he says. “We said, okay, how can we get more sales, more volume out of a market like Toronto, but differently? Less fixed costs, closer to the customer.” Rona is holding on to some big box stores, especially in Quebec. But Rodier says people are no longer willing to drive long distances or sit in traffic to get to a superstore. “In my mind, it’s the right course of action. I think instead of focusing on expansion Rona needs to focus on profitability,” says Canaccord Genuity analyst Derek Dley. While Dley does not rule out the possibility that Rona has foreseen a broader trend, he mainly connects Rona’s move out of the big box to tough competition from Home Depot and Lowe’s. “They were able to take advantage of better real estate locations than Rona was,” he says. “These guys can just pay for better spots.” Rodier disagrees. He blames the economy, not real estate or other business decisions, for sales declines. The company’s strategic plan strikes a similar note: it is called “New Realities, New Solutions”. Ed Strapagiel, executive vice president at Toronto market research firm KubasPrimedia, has not seen enough evidence to make sweeping conclusions one way or the other about big box stores. But he added: “Wal-Mart superstores are doing just fine by all accounts, and they’re building more.” ($1=$1.01 Canadian) ",7222012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-rona-turnaround/analysis-rona-looks-outside-the-big-box-for-a-turnaround-idUSBRE86L0LG20120722
72,HD,Durable goods orders ex-transportation fall in June,"WASHINGTON (Reuters)- - New orders for a range of long-lasting manufactured goods fell in June and a gauge of planned business spending plans dropped, pointing to a slowdown in factory activity. The Commerce Department said on Thursday durable goods orders excluding transportation dropped 1.1 percent, the biggest decline since January, after rising 0.8 percent in May. Economists had forecast this category being flat last month. Overall orders increased 1.6 percent as demand for aircraft surged, after an upwardly revised 1.6 percent increase the prior month. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast orders for durable goods, items from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last at least three years, rising 0.4 percent after a previously reported 1.3 percent increase in May. “The manufacturing sector is going through a weak patch with orders excluding transportation falling over the last three months. This is also the message of the sub-50 readings on the ISM manufacturing composite and new orders indexes for June,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. Details of the report were generally weak, with declines in new orders for computers, fabricated metal products, electrical equipment and appliances and machinery. Fears of tighter fiscal policy in early 2013 and a lingering debt crisis in Europe are dampening demand, causing a cooling in manufacturing activity. Factories have been the main pillar of support for the sluggish economic recovery. Last month, orders for transportation equipment rose 8.0 percent as demand for civilian aircraft soared 14.3 percent, offsetting a 0.6 percent fall in new orders for motor vehicles. The decline in autos was the largest since September last year. Boeing received orders for 24 planes in June, up from 8 in May, according to information posted on the plane maker’s website. That accounted for some of the jump in transportation orders. Orders for defense aircraft surged 23.9 percent after rising 11.2 percent in May. Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, fell 1.4 percent after increasing 2.7 percent May. Economists had expected this category to rise 0.6 percent after a previously reported 2.1 percent increase the prior month. Shipments of non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, used to calculate equipment and software spending in the gross domestic product report, increased 1.2 percent after rising 1.1 percent in May. The increase suggests spending on equipment and software grew in the second quarter, but probably nowhere near levels seen in 2011. Orders for defense capital goods soared 62.0 percent in June, the biggest rise since December 2007. The government is expected to report on Friday that the economy grew at a 1.5 percent annual rate in the second quarter, according to a Reuters survey, slowing from the 1.9 percent rate in the prior three months.

73,HD,"U.S. sets duties on washers from Mexico, South Korea","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday set preliminary anti-dumping duties on about $1 billion worth of residential washing machines from Mexico and South Korea in a case brought by American manufacturer Whirlpool. The department estimated Mexico manufacturers were selling the washers in the United States at prices 33.30 percent to 72.41 percent below fair value. It said South Korean producers were undercutting prices by 9.62 percent to 82.41 percent. In an odd twist, one of the two Mexican manufacturers hit with the 72.41 percent preliminary duty was Whirlpool itself. Whirlpool said in a statement it has stopped shipping washers from Mexico for sale in the United States and therefore would not face any duties. The company said it has made significant investments at its Clyde, Ohio plant and expects nearly 100 percent of the washers its sells in the United States will be American-made by 2013. “Whirlpool is committed to building products in the regions where they are sold and investing in our U.S. manufacturing presence. Our investments will continue as long as we can compete on a level playing field, with all of our foreign competitors playing by the established rules,” company spokeswoman Kristine Vernier said. U.S. Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown hailed the decision, which he said would help restore a level playing field for the century-old American manufacturer. “If we want to encourage companies like Whirlpool to continue moving jobs back to the U.S., then we also have to get tough on countries that don’t play by the rules,” Brown said. Washers made by Electrolux and Samsung in Mexico were hit with a preliminary anti-dumping duties of 33.30 percent and 72.41 percent, respectively. Washers made by Daewoo, LG Electronics and Samsung in South Korea received preliminary anti-dumping duties of 82.41 percent, 12.15 percent, and 9.62 percent, respectively. Samsung and Electrolux said they disagreed with the decision and would continue to fight the duties. In a similar case involving refrigerators from Mexico and South Korea, the U.S. International Trade Commission struck down duties imposed by the Commerce Department on the grounds that Whirlpool was not materially injured by the imports. Caryn Klebba, a spokeswoman for Electrolux, said its share of the laundry machine market in the United States was only 5.6 percent compared to Whirlpool’s 56 percent, giving the company hope the ITC would rescue them again. Samsung said it no longer makes washers in Mexico so it also would not be affected by those preliminary duties. Importers have to post bonds or cash deposits based on the preliminary rates. In Daewoo’s case, the required cash deposit will be slightly less than the preliminary duty rate, the Commerce Department said. The United States imported some $434 million of residential washers from Mexico and $568 million from South Korea in 2011. The Commerce Department in May also set a preliminary “countervailing duty” of nearly 71 percent on washers made by Daewoo in South Korea to offset government subsidies. LG and Samsung received duties of just 0.22 percent and 1.20 percent, respectively, in that phase of case. A final decision on both types of duties is expected by the end of the year.

74,HD,Lowe's offers to buy Canada's Rona for C$1.8 billion,"(Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos (LOW.N), the world’s No. 2 home improvement chain, wants to spend C$1.8 billion to buy Canadian competitor Rona Inc RON.TO, but the struggling Canadian retailer publicly rejected the offer on Tuesday and said its own turnaround plan offered a better chance of success. Rona, Canada’s home-grown answer to Lowe’s and Home Depot Inc (HD.N), said the C$14.50 a share proposal was not the best deal for its shareholders. Smarting from years of disappointing sales, it wants to close some of its big box stores and focus on smaller outlets that it says its customers prefer. At stake is both Rona’s long history as an independent company deeply rooted in Quebec, and Lowe’s attempt to kickstart its Canadian expansion by acquiring hundreds of stores and a large national distribution network. Lowe’s said its plan has the support of institutional shareholders with about 15 percent of Rona’s outstanding shares. Its July 8 proposal represents a 36.7 percent premium to the stock’s closing price on Friday, July 6. North Carolina-based Lowe’s sees a deal with Rona as a way to fight Home Depot in Canada, where the domestic economy has been relatively strong, and the housing market never experienced the crash seen in the United States. Acquiring Rona would also give Lowe’s a chance to build up a presence in Rona’s home province of Quebec, where the U.S. company has no operations at all. “We are disappointed that the Rona board said no,” Doug Robinson, Lowe’s head of international operations and development, told Reuters in an interview. “We really want to take a little bit of time to consider options.” But the proposal is already facing political opposition in Quebec, where the ruling Liberals will face a tough challenge from the pro-independence Parti Quebecois in an election campaign expected to start this week. Quebec Finance Minister Raymond Bachon said the offer was not in the best interest of either Canada or Quebec and he has asked economic development agency Investissement Quebec to work out what could be done to counter the proposal. Provincial views are not a determining factor in foreign takeovers, but competition lawyers said federal officials reviewing the deal would pay heed to provincial views. “Traditionally the federal government has been very sensitive to Quebec’s needs and desires,” said one lawyer, who specializes in regulatory reviews and competition law and who asked not to be named due to possible conflicts of interest. “It seems that people pay special attention, when Quebec voices its views, especially when it is in relation to companies that are headquartered in its province.” Under the Investment Canada Act, Ottawa can review any foreign investment worth more than C$330 million and can block a deal it thinks is not in Canada’s best interests. It has exercised that prerogative only twice, most recently in 2010 when it said BHP Billiton’s (BHP.AX) hostile bid for Canadian fertilizer maker Potash Corp POT.TO was not of net benefit. Rona shares rose as high as C$14.49 before easing back to C$13.50, a gain 13.7 percent, as investors lowered their expectations of a deal being struck in the face of Quebec’s objections. Lowe’s stock was down 4.8 percent at $25.58. Morningstar analyst Peter Wahlstrom saw little chance that Lowe’s would approach shareholders with a hostile bid. Boucherville, Quebec-based Rona has struggled as Home Depot and Lowe’s have made inroads into its home turf. Sales at Rona’s established stores, or same-store sales - a key measure for retailers - dropped 7.3 percent in the year ended December 25, 2011. Rona has blamed its weak performance on poor consumer confidence, and its recovery plan centers on closing or splitting up 23 of its 79 biggest outlets and focusing on smaller “satellite” and “proximity” stores. Rona spokeswoman Michelle Laberge said a special committee of the board had considered Lowe’s offer. “They believe that the plan that we have announced and that we are rolling out right now has greater potential to create more value in the mid- to long-term,” she said. Neither Home Depot nor Lowe’s break out Canadian results, so it hard to compare their performance to that at Rona. But in its last two reported quarters, Home Depot said same-store sales rose in Canada. Lowe’s said the two companies’ chief executives first met in July 2011, at Rona’s request, “to discuss a potential relationship.” Rona’s board rejected an earlier proposal from December 15, 2011, was rejected by Rona’s board, and Robinson said the new offer was “marginally” higher than the December one. Lowe’s operates more than 1,745 stores in North America, including 31 in Canada. Bigger rival Home Depot, which has been in Canada more than a decade longer, has 180 Canadian outlets. Rona, founded in 1939 by independent hardware stores in Quebec , operates nearly 800 locations and supplies almost 1,500 stores in Canada. Its stores are mostly smaller than Lowe’s outlets and many Rona dealers are family businesses with a long history in the network, and a stake in the public company. “I have read many comments where people said that Lowe’s would not be interested in the smaller format or the dealer businesses. That is just factually incorrect,” said Robinson. Rona’s biggest shareholder is pension fund Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, which said on Tuesday it had raised its stake in the company to 14.18 percent. It said it will evaluate the offer based on the value it creates for its depositors and shareholders, but also factor in the importance of the continuing development of Rona’s Quebec supplier network. Caisse, formed nearly five decades ago by the government of Quebec to manage the funds of the Quebec pension plan, also has a mandate to contribute to the province’s economic development.

But even before Tuesday’s news, the stock had risen 12 percent in three months, partly on hopes that Lowe’s might bid. Scotiabank and BMO Capital Markets are acting as Rona’s financial advisors, with Norton Rose Canada LLP and Davies Ward Phillips & Vineberg acting as its legal advisors.

79,HD,Retail sales gain hints at stronger growth,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Retail sales rose in July for the first time in four months as demand climbed for goods ranging from cars to electronics, a sign that consumers could drive faster economic growth in the third quarter. Sales rose 0.8 percent last month, the largest gain since February and well above analysts’ expectations, Commerce Department data showed on Tuesday. A separate report showed U.S. producer prices increased in July at the fastest pace in five months even as energy prices fell. The broad-based expansion in retail sales bolstered the view that the slowdown in economic growth during the second quarter will prove temporary. “Here comes the U.S. consumer,” said Harm Bandholz, an economist at UniCredit in New York. Consumer spending drives the U.S. economy, and the report could give some relief to President Barack Obama, whose November re-election bid against Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, has been imperiled by a weak recovery. But after a dismal spring, summer has brought more reassuring signs for the economy. Hiring accelerated in July despite an uptick in the jobless rate, and Tuesday’s data added to uncertainty that the Federal Reserve will implement a third round of bond-buying, or quantitative easing, to stimulate growth. “Today’s retail sales data further reduces the likelihood of QE3 in September, but does not take it off the table,” said Michelle Meyer, an economist at Bank of America in New York. Fed policymakers meet next on September 12-13. Economists polled by Reuters had expected retail sales to rise 0.3 percent. U.S. stocks climbed on the data, as did yields on U.S. government debt. The dollar rose against the yen. Pointing to a strong increase in consumer spending in July, the so-called core measure of retail sales - which excludes autos, gasoline and building materials - rose 0.9 percent. That was the biggest gain since January. Stronger consumer spending would help corporations doing business in the United States. Home Depot Inc, the world’s largest home improvement chain, reported a quarterly profit that beat Wall Street views on Tuesday and raised its earnings outlook for the fiscal year. Economic growth in the United States cooled to a 1.5 percent annual rate in the second quarter from a 2 percent pace in the first three months of the year, and economists are now banking on an acceleration. In the retail report, the government said sales contracted more than previously thought in June, further darkening the view of the second quarter. The Commerce Department said in another report that sales at all businesses slipped in June by the most since March 2009, which economists said should curb some enthusiasm over the jump in retail sales. “Given that sales are only marginally higher since the start of the year, households clearly remain cautious,” said Amna Asaf, an economist with Capital Economics in Toronto. And with good reason. Dark clouds continue to loom over the economic outlook. The euro zone’s debt-ravaged economy shrank in the second quarter after flat-lining in the first, a report showed on Tuesday. Europe’s travails have fueled economic uncertainty, and appear to be choking hiring in the United States. U.S. small business sentiment fell for a third straight month in July as owners worried about sales revenue, according to a survey by the National Federation of Independent Business. By undercutting global growth, the debt crisis in the euro zone has also pushed oil prices lower since March. While the Labor Department’s index of producer prices, which measures prices received by farms, factories and refineries, climbed 0.3 percent last month on higher costs for consumer goods and food, the gain was muted by a drop in energy prices. Still, core inflation at the wholesale level accelerated in July. The core measure has held at higher levels even as a sharp drop in energy prices over the past year has pulled overall producer prices lower. Some policymakers at the Fed worry that further moves to lower borrowing costs could fuel inflation, though the central bank has said it was ready to do more to help the economy if needed. “This report suggests core inflation will persist despite price swings in food and energy,” said Cooper Howes, an economist at Barclays in New York.

80,HD,"Home Depot raises profit view, hopes for housing market","(Reuters) - Cost controls and market share gains helped Home Depot Inc beat Wall Street’s profit estimates for the latest quarter, prompting the No. 1 home improvement chain to raise its earnings outlook for the fiscal year. The retailer is also seeing improvements in California and Florida, states that were hit hard by the housing downturn, Chief Executive Officer Frank Blake said on Tuesday. The news boosted Home Depot shares as much as 4 percent to their highest level in 12 years and raised hopes that the company was positioned to keep outdoing rival Lowe’s Cos Inc once the housing market and the U.S. economy stabilize further. “The worst of the (housing) crisis is behind us,” said Barclays analyst Alan Rifkin, who added that he was seeing signs of stability after years of declines. Groundbreaking on new U.S. homes rose in June, hitting its fastest pace in more than three years, a report showed last month. “Housing is now a contributor to GDP growth, rather than a drag,” said Blake, who has often been credited for improving Home Depot’s merchandise, supply chain and customer service. For Home Depot, he said, Florida and California were among the best-performing states in the quarter in terms of sales growth at stores open at least a year. During the housing downturn, Home Depot’s same-store sales were down more than 20 percent in those markets, Chief Financial Officer Carol Tome told Reuters, but shoppers there are now spending across the store. “We fell so dramatically,” Tome said. “We are just starting to kind of grow back into where we were, and we are not there yet.” U.S. retail sales rose 0.8 percent in July, their first gain in four months, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. Demand increased for everything from cars to electronics, signaling that consumers could drive faster economic growth in the third quarter. Home Depot is “executing marvelously” and taking market share from Lowe’s with the help of better pricing and customer service, Rifkin said. He said he expected Lowe’s to post lower same-store sales growth than Home Depot for the 13th consecutive quarter when it reports its results next week. Shares of Home Depot were up 3.9 percent at $54.88 in midday trading after touching a high of $54.95 earlier in the session. At Monday’s close, they had climbed more than 26 percent this year. While the stock trades at a high price-to-earnings multiple, the lofty premium is justified, said analyst Walter Stackow of Manning & Napier, which owns shares in the company. “You have slow economic growth in general in the U.S., and there’s some uncertainty,” Stackow said. “What Home Depot offers is earnings growth, high amount of visibility and reasonably high predictability,” and it is picking up market share. Net earnings rose to $1.53 billion, or $1.01 a share, in the second quarter ended on July 29 from $1.36 billion, or 86 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts were expecting a profit of 97 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Home Depot, which cut operating expenses by 2.7 percent to $4.46 billion in the quarter, has benefited from its recent efforts to improve distribution and customer service. It has been quicker than Lowe’s to cut costs, and in some cases has gotten a boost as housing markets have rebounded in regions where it has a heavy presence. A return to more localized marketing and merchandising has also helped Home Depot. Sales rose 1.7 percent to $20.57 billion, but missed the analysts’ average estimate of $20.74 billion. The company’s second quarter is typically the most important selling period for home improvement chains, but unseasonably warm weather early in the year pulled some demand into the first quarter. In the second quarter, same-store sales rose 2.1 percent globally, including a 2.6 percent increase in the United States. While Home Depot’s results exceeded his estimates, Janney Capital Markets analyst David Strasser said he was less optimistic about same-store sales growth in the back half of the year, citing consumer spending trends. The company’s operating performance remains impressive, but that is largely priced into the stock, Strasser said. Home Depot said it still expected total fiscal-year sales to rise 4.6 percent. It forecast earnings at $2.95 a share, up from its prior outlook of $2.90. The company, which has stores in the United States, Canada, Mexico and China, reported a 0.6 percent rise in the number of customer transactions in the second quarter, and their average value increased 1.8 percent to $55.02.

Both Home Depot’s earnings and the retail data, which showed retail sales rose for the first time in four months, come after recent housing and jobs numbers lifted hopes that a slowdown in the economy may only be temporary. The better retail sales data also dovetailed with strong earnings reports from niche retailers like Estee Lauder, which jumped nearly 10 percent. “Definitely Wall Street will applaud this data,” said Todd Schoenberger, managing principal at the BlackBay Group in New York. “Retail sales were strong, showing how smart retailers were with their back-to-school promotions.” However, gains were modest after the S&P; 500 rose for seven of the past eight sessions and the perception of risk from Europe’s debt crisis was still running high. Home Depot Inc, world’s largest home improvement chain, gained 3.5 percent to $54.67 as the top boost to the Dow after the company reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit and kept a tight lid on costs to offset weakness in sales. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 37.28 points, or 0.28 percent, to 13,206.71. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 4.40 points, or 0.31 percent, to 1,408.51. The Nasdaq Composite Index added 10.27 points, or 0.34 percent, to 3,032.79. The S&P; 500 is up 12 percent this year after rallying 10 percent from yearly lows reached in June. The rally, which has brought the index to within a stone’s throw of new four-year highs, has also left investors looking for new catalysts to move the market higher. Home Depot is seeing improvements in California and Florida, states that were hit hard by the housing downturn, according to Chief Executive Officer Frank Blake. The comments helped lift housing stocks, and the Dow Jones Home Construction index  rose 1.2 percent. Reports from smaller retailers supported the thesis of  robust consumer spending that may help lift overall growth. Michael Kors Holdings Ltd surged 13.4 percent to $48.05 after the apparel company reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year profit forecast. Estee Lauder jumped 9.1 percent to $59.96 after the cosmetics and fragrance maker reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit and forecast more sales growth this year. Saks Inc reported a narrower-than-expected second quarter loss on Tuesday as sales gains defied what the luxury retailer said was a tough economy, and the retailer stuck to its sales forecast for the second half of the fiscal year. Shares climbed 6 percent to $11.51. Retail sales rose 0.8 percent in July, the biggest increase since February. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.3 percent increase. The S&P; retail index gained 1 percent. “The retail sales is good, and it just continues the trend right now for the S&P; to go higher,” said Frank Lesh, a futures analyst and broker at FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago. “It keeps us going for now. I didn’t see anything here that said sell your longs or get out; if anything, it said buy.” Separately, producer prices rose in July at the fastest pace in five months on higher costs for light trucks, pharmaceutical drugs and cigarettes, although falling energy prices pointed to muted inflation pressures. Groupon Inc tumbled 23.6 percent to $5.77 after the world’s largest online daily deals provider missed quarterly revenue expectations and gave a cautious profit outlook.

The results on Monday came just days after Home Depot Inc  beat Wall Street profit estimates with the help of cost controls and market share gains, and raised its earnings forecast. Shares of Lowe’s fell 5.3 percent to $26.40 in morning trading, while Home Depot dipped 1 percent to $56.17. “Lowe’s is a turnaround story, and it’s not turning,” said Sanford C. Bernstein & Co analyst Colin McGranahan. The company has cut jobs, curbed store expansion plans and streamlined its supply chain to cut costs and compete more effectively, but it has yet to see results. It recently decided to provide fewer discounts on expensive items like appliances, in sync with its bigger plan to offer “everyday low prices” rather than promotions. The move has driven some shoppers away. “The team is making progress on these initiatives but, frankly, the benefits are accruing at a slower rate than I had expected,” Chief Executive Robert Niblock said on a conference call with analysts. “It will likely be mid-2013 before we fully complete this phase of our transformation.” Analysts said other efforts, such as a credit card discount program, had hurt margins more than they had helped sales. “The biggest disappointment was the margins,” McGranahan said. “They lowered some prices, they offered a 5 percent discount on their credit cards, and it doesn’t look like they got any traction yet.” Gross margin fell to 33.9 percent in the latest quarter from 34.5 percent a year earlier. Sales suffered in the traditionally strong second quarter, which ended on Aug. 3, as unseasonably warm weather early in the year pulled some demand into the first quarter. Sales at Lowe’s stores open at least a year fell 0.4 percent, including a 0.2 percent decrease for the U.S. business, the 13th straight quarter that the company trailed Home Depot in same-store sales. “Lowe’s inability to drive sales despite discounting remains a concern,” Janney analyst David Strasser said in a research note. Net earnings fell to $747 million, or 64 cents a share, from $830 million, or 64 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected 70 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales fell 2 percent to $14.25 billion, while analysts had expected $14.46 billion. Mooresville, North Carolina-based Lowe’s, which has stores in the United States, Canada and Mexico, now expects flat sales for the fiscal year ending Feb. 1. It forecast earnings of $1.64 a share, down from a May outlook of $1.73 to $1.83. Last month, the company offered to buy Rona Inc, but the struggling Canadian retailer rejected the proposal. “First and foremost, an acquisition is not imminent,” CEO Niblock said on Monday. “We are evaluating our options ... whether or not we can complete confirmatory due diligence and ensure a fair price and an adequate return on our investment.”   (Reporting by Dhanya Skariachan in New York and Nivedita Bhattacharjee in Chicago; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and John Wallace)",8202012,http://www.reuters.com/article/lowes-results/update-4-lowes-misses-estimates-lags-home-depot-idUSL4E8JK3SM20120820

86,HD,"Second-quarter growth revised up, Fed still seen in play","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The economy fared slightly better than initially thought in the second quarter, but the pace of growth remained too slow to shut the door on further monetary easing from the Federal Reserve. Gross domestic product expanded at a 1.7 percent annual rate, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday, as stronger export growth offset a pull-back in restocking by businesses wary of sluggish domestic demand. While that was an improvement on the government’s first estimate of 1.5 percent published last month and the composition of growth was fairly favorable, it was insufficient to cut into an unemployment rate that ticked up to 8.3 percent in July. The lack of stronger job growth, along with the uncertainty stemming from Europe’s debt crisis and fears of big U.S. government spending cuts and tax hikes in 2013, could compel the U.S. central bank to offer additional stimulus by year end. “I don’t think this really changes the dovish sentiment of the Fed,” said Michael Hanson, a senior economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York. “They are going to look at this and say 1.7 percent is below trend, that’s not where we want to be and the risks going forward are still material.” A growth pace of between 2 percent and 2.5 percent is generally seen as needed just to hold the jobless rate steady, and the sluggish recovery is proving to be a difficult hurdle for President Barack Obama in his quest to secure a second term in November’s election. Growth in the third quarter is expected to show an improvement, but still remain below the economy’s potential. A second report showed contracts to buy previously owned homes hit their highest level in more than two years in July, suggesting the housing market’s recovery was gaining traction and offering a relative economic bright spot. The lackluster recovery has sparked a sharp debate among Fed officials over whether they should launch another round of bond purchases to spur stronger growth. Economists say the outcome of the central bank’s next meeting on September 12-13 will be a close call. Jobs growth has picked up a bit and housing and retail sales have strengthened. However, business spending looks weak and inflation is slowing. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke could offer more clarity on the outlook for monetary policy when he speaks at a gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Friday. “Growth is neither strong enough for Bernanke to take any additional easing off the table, but it is hardly weak enough to force him to announce new actions,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. The Fed’s Beige Book report, which offers a snapshot of the economy, described economic activity as continuing to “gradually” expand in July and early August. It noted, however, that manufacturing activity was softening in many regions of the country. Stocks on Wall Street were little changed for a third straight day as investors opted to wait for Bernanke’s speech. Treasury debt prices fell, while the dollar eked out modest gains versus a basket of currencies. The revised GDP data showed export growth was strong, while import growth was the smallest in a year. Trade contributed 0.32 percentage point to GDP growth instead of subtracting a third of a point, as previously reported. “We expect softer export growth over the coming quarters, but not a collapse because the majority of exports stay in North America (and) will be insulated from what’s going on in Europe and China,” said Paul Edelstein, an economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts. The export strength helped to offset the drag from inventories. However, the careful management of stocks could be a boost to the economy in the third quarter. Excluding inventories, GDP rose at a 2.0 percent rate rather than 1.2 percent. Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of U.S. economic activity, was revised up a notch to a 1.7 percent pace from the previously reported 1.5 percent. Still, that marked a step-down from the first quarter’s 2.4 percent pace, and a smaller rise is expected this quarter with demand for big-ticket items such as automobiles cooling. Stronger than previously reported investment in the construction of nonresidential structures also gave a lift to GDP growth in the second quarter. But growth in business investment in equipment and software was lowered to a 4.7 percent pace, the slowest since the third quarter of 2009, from 7.2 percent previously. Growth in spending by businesses on equipment and software has slowed sharply from a peak of 18.3 percent in the third quarter of last year, and the retrenchment appears to have intensified early this quarter. “There’s no question that as we look toward the end of the year and the risk presented by federal spending cuts and tax increases, the economy remains in a vulnerable window,” said Jim Baird, chief investment strategist at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The report also showed that after-tax corporate profits rose at a 1.1 percent rate after sinking 8.6 percent in the first quarter. Government spending declined, but the drop was not as deep as previously reported. And even though consumer spending was bumped up, inflation pressures remained muted.

87,HD,Consumer spending posts biggest rise in five months,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Consumer spending got off to a fairly firm start in the third quarter, rising by the most in five months and offering hope economic growth would pick up this quarter. Other data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits held steady last week. The reports were consistent with only moderate economic and job growth, and they kept alive the prospect of additional monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve. “The economy does not seem to be faltering or going into reverse,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York. “(But) for a Fed that thinks the economy is not good enough, the data today is not consistent with 3 percent-plus growth or a falling unemployment rate.” Officials at the central bank are debating whether a third round of bond purchases is warranted to spur a stronger recovery, and investors will look to a speech by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke on Friday for clues on the Fed’s next step. The Commerce Department said consumer spending increased 0.4 percent in July after a flat reading in June. The rise was in line with economists’ expectations. With a gauge of prices holding steady, spending was also up 0.4 percent on an inflation-adjusted basis, which was also the largest increase since February. While separate reports from U.S. retailers indicated some of the spending momentum carried into August, economists expect spending to cool a bit in the months ahead because of sluggish income growth and a recent rise in gasoline prices. A range of retail outlets from Costco Wholesale Corp to Limited Brands Inc posted better-than-expected sales gains. “There was some pent up demand after soft spending through the second quarter,” said Robert Dye, chief economist at Comerica in Dallas. “What we are going to need to see is consumer confidence holding its own and moderate job growth for that to continue through the third quarter. Those two key issues are still in doubt.” The Labor Department said first-time applications for state unemployment benefits were unchanged last week at 374,000. The four-week moving average for new claims, a better measure of labor market trends, rose 1,500 to 370,250 - a level economists views as consistent with only sluggish hiring. Stocks on Wall Street fell as investors turned defensive ahead of Bernanke’s speech, while Treasury debt prices rose. The dollar moved up against a basket of currencies. The level of new claims last week was 10,000 above where it stood at the beginning of the month, suggesting job growth moderated. In July employers had added 163,000 workers, which was a sharp step up from June, when the economy created only 64,000 new jobs. Even though data on consumer spending and housing suggest economic activity picked up early in the third quarter, business spending is weakening and inflation is slowing. The jobless rate, which ticked up to 8.3 percent in July, has been stuck above 8 percent for more than three years, the first time this has happened since the Great Depression. With the labor market not showing decisive improvement, the question of whether the Fed will ease monetary policy further at its September 12-13 policy meeting remains firmly on the table. Atlanta Fed Bank President James Lockhart told CNBC the central bank’s decision would be a “close call.” A Reuters poll of fund managers found that only 44 percent think the Fed will announce a third round of bond purchases in September, down from 70 percent last month before July’s employment data was released. The pickup in consumer spending was a welcome bit of news that buttressed the case of hawks at the central bank who think monetary policy has already done enough. In the second quarter, consumption had expanded at the slowest pace in a year, helping to hold back economic growth to a modest 1.7 percent annual rate. Others at the central bank could argue that with inflation slowing, there is room to act to spur more vigorous growth. A price index for personal spending was flat after edging up 0.1 percent in June. In the 12 months through July, this index was up just 1.3 percent — the smallest gain since October 2009. A core measure that strips out food and energy costs also held steady last for the first time since September. Over the past 12 month, it has risen 1.6 percent, the least since October. The Fed aims for inflation of 2 percent. Both the overall and core indexes have been below that target since March, a factor some analysts said could tip the balance toward more easing in the debate at the central bank. “The Fed is now in danger of falling short on its price stability mandate,” said Jeremy Lawson, a senior economist at BNP Paribas in New York. “At the margin, this will make it easier for the doves to make the case for the need to launch a new asset purchase program in September.” Last month, household income increased 0.3 percent after rising by the same margin in June. Income available to households after stripping out inflation and taxes increased 0.3 percent after gaining 0.2 percent in June. With spending a touch above income growth, the saving rate slipped to 4.2 percent in July from 4.3 percent the prior month.

89,HD,Canada Q2 growth tops G7 but government sees dangers,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Finance Minister Jim Flaherty warned on Friday that Canadian economic growth may be set to weaken and undermine his budget projections even though second-quarter GDP data exceeded market expectations and was the strongest in the G7. Solid business investment in plant and equipment, along with inventory build-ups, helped Canada register annualized real growth of 1.8 percent in gross domestic product in the second quarter, data on Friday showed. That matched a recent Bank of Canada forecast and beat a market forecast of 1.6 percent. Canada now has had four straight quarters of expansion, Flaherty said. He added that though the growth rate was modest, it was better than any of the others in the G7, the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations. But he said the global economy was fragile, and while the federal budget deficit had been halved in the first three months of the fiscal year, April-June, to C$1.98 billion ($2.00 billion), there was “downward risk to the fiscal track presented in budget 2012 (in March)”. The government did include an adjustment for risk in preparing the budget, he said. “However, further slowing of the global economic situation can be expected to have an impact on Canada,” he added. Flaherty, a long-time critic of what he sees as Europe’s reluctance to deal with its problems, said he had talked to his European counterparts this week and they had expressed optimism about dealing with the euro-zone debt crisis later this year. “I’ll believe it when I see it, because this has been going on for a long time,” he added. “(The European crisis) is affecting the level of economic growth in the emerging economies including China ... this is a drag on the world economy,” he said. Any hit to the Canadian budget deficit would pale in comparison with the trillion-dollar gap faced by Washington. For the whole fiscal year, Canada’s March budget predicted a deficit of C$21.1 billion. The Bank of Canada’s most recent projection, in July, is for economic growth to accelerate to 2.0 percent this quarter and to keep rising to 2.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013. Scotiabank economist Derek Holt said that while Canada’s second quarter growth was better than expected, it was still very soft and did not merit hawkish monetary policy talk. He noted that inventory build-up contributed 1.7 percentage points of growth. “The fact that so much...is coming from inventories signals that there is unanticipated inventory building in a soft economy. It is not a good form of growth.” Nonetheless, businesses also boosted spending on plant and equipment by an annualized 9.4 percent from the first quarter, and Flaherty said real business investment was now above pre-recession levels. Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney pointedly criticized corporations last week, suggesting they should invest their hefty holdings of cash or return it to shareholders. Flaherty said he would like to see more investment in machinery and equipment as it boosts productivity. Overnight index swaps, which trade based on expectations for the central bank’s key policy rate, showed that traders increased bets on a rate hike in 2013 after the GDP data was released. They have now priced in a greater than 50 percent chance of a rate hike by July 2013. Canada’s dollar climbed against its U.S. counterpart after the GDP figures, and was further boosted by remarks by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke that the stagnation of the U.S. labor market was of grave concern and the Fed would act as needed. At midday, the currency had strengthened to C$0.9863 versus the greenback, or $1.0139, from around C$0.9903, or $1.0100, immediately before the release of the data.

90,HD,Permanent fix of U.S. housing to take time: Home Depot CEO,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. housing market is starting to thaw, but it could be two years before a full-blown recovery takes hold, Home Depot Inc (HD.N) Chief Executive Frank Blake said on Thursday. The world’s largest home improvement retailer has seen the benefits of the nascent U.S. housing recovery as professional contractors have started buying more in recent months. “It’s starting to recover, but we’re a long way away from true recovery,” Blake, 63, told Reuters in a wide-ranging interview that touched on his views of the so-called Fiscal Cliff to why he sees the internet as Home Depot’s next frontier. The comments came less than a week after two influential Federal Reserve officials blamed the disappointing rebound in U.S. housing for continuing to trip up the country’s overall economic recovery. “This housing market’s been very, very bad and it’s going to take some time to recover,” Blake said. A bubble in the U.S. housing market was at the core of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, which started the same year that Blake became CEO. During the housing downturn, Home Depot’s sales at established stores fell more than 20 percent in markets such as Florida and California. “The way we look at it is there’s going to be a period of a workout, a fine period of one to two years and then you’re going to get a more robust recovery,” Blake said. Credit availability and the overhang of distressed housing are among the reasons the housing market can’t “just spring back” to where it was before the recession, Blake said. While California and Florida, states slammed by the housing downturn, show signs of improvement, Blake urged investors not to read too much into the recent signs of recovery. “We’ve had head fakes on the housing market coming back, so you always worry that this is a little bit of a head fake,” Blake said. One way to tell the difference is whether or not consumers will again look at a home improvement as a cost they can recoup when they sell their home. “The fundamental question asked in our business is does our customer think about a granite countertop as an expense or an investment?” he said. As it looks for new areas of growth, Home Depot plans to concentrate on building its Internet business rather than overseas expansion, Blake said. Last month, Blake decided to close all seven of Home Depot’s big box stores in China after a failed expansion attempt there. He said he views online business as the next area of expansion, rather than new geographic markets. “Home Depot can afford not to be in Brazil. Home Depot can afford not to be in, name your country. Home Depot cannot afford not to be the best, what we call, inter-connected retailer in our space,” said Blake. The retailer, which bought California-based Red Beacon earlier this year, is interested in making more acquisitions in Silicon Valley to boost its online business and other related capabilities, Blake said. Even in China, the retailer has already started selling goods on website 360buy.com and is looking for opportunities to partner with other e-commerce sites. Blake said he had not yet seen U.S. shoppers holding back from spending because of fears of the looming “fiscal cliff.” That is Washington’s self-imposed year-end deadline to agree on a plan to shrink the federal budget or trigger $600 billion in spending cuts and higher taxes. “We don’t see that in consumer behavior,” Blake said. He was less confident when asked if he thought Washington will find its way through the crisis. “You never want to get too deep into a bet on the rationality of Washington,” Blake replied.

91,HD,"Home Depot, Target could see CDS reverse course","Oct 11 (IFR) - The CDS of big box retailers Home Depot and Target have tightened significantly in recent months, but have the potential to widen in the months ahead as consumer spending is expected to increase only moderately. The US Fed’s Beige Book on Wednesday cited flat consumer spending growth in September, and with a weak holiday shopping season expected, the two retail giants could see their credit default swaps reverse course. Home Depot (A3/A-/A-) and Target Corp  (A2/A+/A-) are both quality names from a credit perspective, with solid balance sheets, stable earnings growth and good customer loyalty. Market sentiment has helped tighten the credit default swaps of Home Depot to 42bp from 52bp in July, while Target’s CDS has tightened to 38bp from 41bp over the same period. Their CDS trade at tight levels relative to other investment-grade names, and are usually resistant to outside factors that provoke spread widening in lesser-rated entities. But despite the solid fundamentals, that outperformance is likely to fade. Moderate CDS widening can be expected if consumer spending continues to advance at a lackluster pace. There are plenty of other problems, too, including the looming fiscal cliff, elevated unemployment, stagnant wages and rising food and gasoline prices. With that as a backdrop, retailers such as Home Depot and Target have adopted a more guarded outlook in the near term - and September same store sales data back up those concerns. If we extrapolate from the self-published figures of a mix of big box, specialty and other retailers, we can get insight into how consumers feel about spending - and sense what to expect in the months ahead. Target’s September store sales came in at 2.1%, as expected, but compare to 5.3% last year. It does, however, place them on track to meet conservative goals. For October, Target forecasts low to mid single digit same store revenue growth. But the retailer had already planned for a stronger first half of 2012 versus the second half, and its CFO John Mulligan said at an analyst presentation last month that he expects “uncertainty” due to the fiscal cliff and presidential election, which is causing consumers to be cautious. At the same presentation, Home Depot CEO Frank Blake noted the tentative nature of consumers who are strapped for cash and less likely to invest in larger home remodeling projects. Even as the nascent housing recovery looks to gain traction, Blake said that many people were still “underwater on their homes,” and less likely to “put money into it and think you’ll get a return.” With expectations for comparable store sales growth in the low single digits, Home Depot has remained conservative in its opinion of the slow economic and housing recovery - and is linking its future growth to the GDP instead. With shoppers already cash-constrained, forecasts for the upcoming holiday season are less than enthusiastic. The National Retail Federation said last week that 2012 holiday sales will rise by an anemic 4.1% year on year, while the International Council of Shopping Centers has put it even lower at 3.0%. Ratings agency Moody’s also anticipates a lackluster holiday season, and expects Q4 sales will grow at their slowest pace since 2009 when, according to their data, the figure was a paltry 0.815%. The agency cites the slow increase of non-wage income as rising prices outpace wages - and as consumers become more reluctant to take on debt. That reluctance to take on debt will curb spending habits, whether holiday or home project-related, and warrants the cautionary outlook from retailers. This will eventually be reflected in the CDS of Home Depot and Target, in the form of widening spreads. And that widening could be spurred on further if consumer spending continues to be restrained. But the companies’ solid fundamentals should limit any moves in that direction.",10112012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-cds/home-depot-target-could-see-cds-reverse-course-idUSL1E8LB9VM20121011

93,HD,"CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-U.S. companies hustle to re-staff, reopen after Sandy","(Corrects final paragraph to show Dow Chemical, not DuPont, reopened facilities in Massachusetts, Connecticut) * Saks, Macy’s hope to open in NYC on Wednesday * Home Depot reopens 33 stores * Wal-Mart says holiday plans are intact * With airports closed, drugmakers seek other ways to ship By Phil Wahba and Jessica Wohl NEW YORK/CHICAGO, Oct 30 (Reuters) - After Hurricane Sandy bashed the East Coast with wind, flooding and a blizzard, companies scrambled on Tuesday to assess the damage, figure out how to get staff back on the job, and get customers what they needed from fresh water to roofing supplies, Wi-Fi and power for laptops. With the holiday season quickly approaching, retailers in particular hurried to get back to business. At Home Depot, one of the biggest challenges during the height of the storm was constantly rerouting trucks filled with supplies as local officials ordered roads closed, said Doug Spiron, Emergency Response Captain at the No. 1 home improvement chain’s command center. A total of 441 stores faced at least tropical storm strength winds during the storm, with 18 facing hurricane force winds. At the peak on Monday, 44 Home Depot stores were closed. “The biggest challenge that we faced was the sheer size of this,” Spiron said. One new strategy that helped Home Depot move goods to stores quickly was paying drivers to stay with trucks at distribution centers during the storm so they could immediately begin deliveries when the storm passed, Spiron said. By late Tuesday afternoon, the number of Home Depot stores closed had dropped to 11. Wal-Mart Stores Inc had 267 stores closed as of late Monday night. By Tuesday afternoon that was down to 80 stores in 10 states. “Customers were buying bread and water faster than we could literally replenish it, but we’ve been able to start putting a dent in that” by working with local suppliers, said Henry Jordan, senior vice president of the Eastern Seaboard division for Walmart U.S. The world’s largest retailer said none of its facilities had been seriously damaged, and there was no disruption to holiday planning. “I think the lesson is that the East Coast needs to prepare for hurricanes just like the Gulf Coast needs to because, you know, that’s an area that prior to Irene was not an issue,” said Mark Cooper, Wal-Mart’s senior director of Global Emergency Management. Luxury department store Saks Inc said on Tuesday that it had reopened three stores in Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania. The retailer’s flagship store on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue, which generates about 20 percent of the company’s sales, and five other stores in New Jersey and Connecticut were due to reopen on Wednesday, said spokeswoman Julia Bentley. Macy’s Inc said its Herald Square flagship store in Manhattan and others in the city and in parts of New Jersey were closed on Tuesday. “The determining factor is if the store and shopping center have electricity, and if associates are able to get to work,”  Macy’s spokesman Jim Sluzewski said, adding that the company had 195 stores closed all or part of the day on Monday, about a quarter of its locations. New Yorkers searching for a cup of coffee had more luck with small chains or delicatessens and, in some cases, Dunkin’ Donuts  than Starbucks. On the Upper West Side of Manhattan, two Starbucks stores on Broadway six blocks apart were closed. A window sign read: “Blame the weatherman, not us. Sorry but we are closed to inclement weather. We look forward to seeing you soon.” French Roast at 85th Street and Broadway had a long line of customers waiting for a place in the bistro-style eatery. A nearby Dunkin’ Donuts was closed. Dunkin’ Donuts franchisees are responsible for making decisions to open their restaurants, a spokesman said, adding that the stores at Rockefeller Center and Penn Station were open. Sue Chen, who owns three Dunkin’ Donut stores on Long Island where almost a million homes and businesses were without power, had power at two of her stores. “I have to thank my manager,” Chen said on Tuesday from behind the counter at her store in Sea Cliff, where she was helping five employees keep up with demand. “Last night, at 2 o’clock, 3 o’clock, he came here and started to make the bagels.” Chen said workers at the store live nearby, so the manager told them to come in. About 250 Starbucks stores from Virginia to Maine were closed, said spokeswoman Haley Drage. “All of our New York metro stores are closed,” she said, adding that the company was assessing when it could safely reopen the stores. “We’re trying to ensure partner safety. We don’t want partners traveling if it’s not safe,” she said, noting that authorities in many localities had urged residents to limit traveling. Some large media companies in New York struggled with power outages at their offices on Tuesday. Viacom’s offices for its Comedy Central, TV Land and Spike TV networks in Lower Manhattan near the Hudson River had no electricity or phone service on Tuesday and employees stayed home, a spokesman said. Comedy Central’s hit late night shows “The Daily Show with Jon Stewart” and “The Colbert Report”, which have Manhattan studios, canceled tapings on Monday and Tuesday. Media companies in Midtown Manhattan, above power outages, fared better. At HBO, which is owned by Time Warner Inc, a spokesman said the New York-based shows “Girls” and “Boardwalk Empire” had already wrapped production so they were unaffected by the storm. New York staff who had electricity were working from home on Tuesday “doing what needs to be done to keep the network running,” he said. A spokeswoman for NBC Universal, which is headquartered at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, said news operations had been working around the clock, and its Chief Executive Steve Burke was in the office on Monday and Tuesday. She said most employees had been working from home, but they would start trickling back to the office in the next few days. Staff at news magazine “The Week” hauled their own computers and servers down five flights of stairs on Tuesday morning to set up a temporary office in a hotel conference room across the street so they could meet their printing deadline. U.S. telephone companies struggled to provide services on Tuesday as flooding, power outages and even snow crippled their networks. The Federal Communications Commission estimated that about 25 percent of wireless broadcast towers were out on Tuesday and that outages could worsen before getting better. Verizon Communications spent the day trying to pump water from central offices that house critical equipment for home phone, Internet and television services. Drugmakers, heavily concentrated in New York and New Jersey, were laid low by the storm. Novartis AG said all of its offices in the area were closed on Tuesday, as did insulin maker Novo Nordisk. GlaxoSmithKline Plc said it had implemented a continuity plan to ensure medicines would be distributed, especially given the numerous airport closures. The company also said there was sufficient inventory in the supply chain to avoid serious disruptions. Relatively high amounts of pharmaceuticals move by air, since drugs are light and high-value items, meaning companies like GSK have to arrange road transportation when air transportation is unavailable. BASF, the world’s largest chemical company, said its East Coast facilities had sustained minor damage in the storm. None of chemical maker DuPont’s facilities, many of which are in the direct path of Hurricane Sandy in Delaware and New Jersey, were seriously damaged, according to spokeswoman Tara Stewart. Dow Chemical Co said it has already reopened one facility in Connecticut and one in Massachusetts.

98,HD,Home Depot view up as housing heals; Sandy lift looms,"(Reuters) - Home Depot Inc (HD.N) raised its full-year outlook on Tuesday, even before considering any future sales lift from superstorm Sandy, as the retailer benefited from a recent uptick in the U.S. housing market. The nascent recovery in housing has encouraged professional contractors to buy more in recent months. Home Depot, the world’s largest home improvement chain, has also gained from its own efforts to improve distribution, cut costs and localize marketing and merchandising. Janney Capital Markets analyst David Strasser said Sandy “will certainly help the home improvement sector in the next few quarters”. The fact that Home Depot’s new forecast does not include those benefits was helping to push up the stock, he said, along with “further evidence of a company running on all cylinders.” Shares of Home Depot, which also beat analysts’ quarterly earnings and sales estimates, were up 4.2 percent at $63.72 in midday trading. “Sales were considerably higher than we had anticipated,” said Chief Financial Officer Carol Tome in an interview. “The whole store performed better than expected.” “We believe we’re on a path to recovery. We’re not there, but we’re on a path,” she said. The U.S. housing market, which is being buoyed by low interest rates and falling inventories, is becoming “an assist to growth, rather than an anchor,” added. Rising sales are pushing down the stock of unsold properties on the market, lifting prices and giving builders more confidence to take on new projects. The company said it had rung up $70 million in third-quarter sales to consumers who stocked up on flashlights, batteries, generators and extension cords before Sandy slammed into New Jersey on October 29, the day after the quarter ended. Home Depot expects a bigger sales boost ahead because of rebuilding efforts, but could not pinpoint its magnitude or timing. Home Depot raised its full-year sales growth forecast to 5.2 percent from 4.6 percent. The company said it expected earnings of $3.03 a share, excluding an 11-cent charge for closing stores in China. Its prior full-year forecast, given before news of the China closures, called for a profit of $2.95 per share. The new forecast implies fourth-quarter earnings of 62 cents per share, according to Janney Capital Markets analyst David Strasser. That is one cent higher than analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Home Depot derived about $360 million in incremental sales from Hurricane Irene last year, whose strong winds tore off roofs and caused trees to fall on homes. So far, estimates are pegging property damage from Sandy at around $20 billion, Tome said, versus about $16 billion from Irene. “With Sandy sadly, this is structural. Homes are destroyed,” said Tome. “It’s more like Katrina, and if you think about Katrina, the rebuilding continues in New Orleans.” So far in November, sales have been “quite good,” Tome said, with strength in the southern and western parts of the country, which the storm did not affect. The company’s outlook reflects plans to buy back $700 million in additional shares this quarter, which would bring the total value of repurchases for the year to $4 billion. Net earnings rose to $947 million, or 63 cents per share, in the third quarter from $934 million, or 60 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding a charge for closing seven stores in China, Home Depot said earnings were 74 cents per share. On that basis, analysts were expecting 70 cents. Sales rose nearly 5 percent to $18.13 billion, topping analysts’ estimates of $17.93 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year increased 4.2 percent globally, including a 4.3 percent rise in the United States. Edward Jones analyst Robin Diedrich was expecting same-store sales growth of just above 3 percent. “Things are going pretty well for them, with sales remaining strong,” said Diedrich, who has a “hold” rating on the shares due to their valuation. “The stock has done extremely well and trades at quite a premium to the rest of retail.” Home Depot has been taking market share from rival Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) with the help of better pricing and customer service, analysts have said. Lowe’s, which has lagged Home Depot in same-store sales for 13 straight quarters, plans to report its results next week.

100,HD,"US STOCKS-Wall St gains, led by retail sector after Home Depot","* Home Depot shares rally after results, outlook * Traders say buying may be due to rumors about Spain bailout request * Microsoft shares slip on executive exit * Indexes: Dow up 0.5 pct, S&P; 500 up 0.5 pct, Nasdaq up 0.1 pct   (Updates to late morning; changes byline) By Angela Moon NEW YORK, Nov 13 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday in a sharp turnaround from earlier losses, led by gains in retail stocks after strong results from Home Depot, the world’s largest home improvement company. Traders said rumors that Spain may be close to asking for a sovereign bailout may have boosted buying. Dow component Home Depot Inc was the top gainer on the S&P; 500, climbing 4.5 percent to $63.90 after reporting earnings that beat expectations and raising its outlook. Rival retailer Lowes Companies also gained, up 1.1 percent to $32.32. Energy stocks, which were trading lower earlier, also turned around sharply. The S&P; 500 energy sector index rose 0.7 percent. Technology shares were little changed and earlier were under  pressure from weakness in Microsoft after the executive most widely tipped to be the next chief executive left the company. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 74.71 points, or 0.58 percent, at 12,889.79. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  was up 7.49 points, or 0.54 percent, at 1,387.52. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 1.24 points, or 0.04 percent, at 2,905.50. The euro zone debt crisis continued to roil global markets. “The intraday moves are pretty big today as we continue to be in a rumor-filled market, mainly news out of Europe,” said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research in Cincinnati, Ohio. Despite the gains, the S&P; 500 was still down nearly 2 percent for the month on lingering concerns about the “fiscal cliff” in the U.S., and debt crisis in the euro zone. The fiscal cliff is a series of budget cuts and tax hikes that begin to take effect in the new year. Market participants worry that if no deal is reached to avoid going over the cliff, the economy could fall back into recession. Concerns over this possibility contributed to the S&P;’s worst week since June last week, with no sign of a bottom despite a drop of almost 3 percent over the past two weeks. “The attention in the equity markets has shifted more noticeably to the possibility that the U.S. fails to properly handle the so-called fiscal cliff,” said Ari Wald, analyst at PrinceRidge Group. He said equities in developed countries have been outperforming U.S. stocks despite worries about the euro zone’s financial health.

105,HD,Appeal of $7.2 billion card-fee settlement deferred,"(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court refused to hear an expedited appeal of the preliminary approval of a $7.2 billion settlement between Visa Inc, Mastercard Inc. and merchants over credit card fees. In a brief order, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York denied one objecting merchant, The Home Depot’s, request for expedited arguments and a decision on its appeal. The court also said all other objecting parties’ briefs on their appeals should not be filed until after the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York has issued final approval of the settlement. A hearing on final approval is expected to be scheduled for sometime next year. The deal, which received preliminary approval last month, would be the largest federal antitrust settlement in U.S. history, offering nearly 8 million merchants $7.2 billion in cash and temporary reductions in the interchange, or swipe fees, they pay to process credit and debit transactions. Many of the merchants supported the deal, but dozens of retailers and trade groups that brought the proposed class action, including The Home Depot, objected to a portion of the settlement that would release Visa and Mastercard from new legal claims over related interchange issues Hundreds of merchants, including the world’s largest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc, also have objected to the proposed settlement, claiming it offers meaningless relief for merchants saddled with an estimated $30 billion in annual swipe fees. Home Depot did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jeff Shindler, a lawyer who represents a group of plaintiffs objecting to the settlement, said his clients remain confident in their position and will continue to “press that position at every turn going forward.” However, Craig Wildfang, co-lead counsel for the merchants who support the deal, welcomed the court’s decision. “We’re happy that the 2nd Circuit has agreed with us that there’s no imminent harm to anyone from preliminary approval and that is letting the approval process play out,” he said.

109,HD,BlackBerry shares drop as Home Depot switches to iPhone,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Shares of BlackBerry fell 3 percent on Monday after U.S. home improvement retailer Home Depot Inc said it is replacing the BlackBerry smartphones it provides its executives and managers with Apple Inc’s iPhone. The news is a setback for BlackBerry as it fights to retain its base of big corporate clients and government agencies. The recent launch of a revamped line of smartphones powered by its reengineered BlackBerry 10 operating system was a crucial step in that effort. BlackBerry, which is changing its legal name from Research In Motion Ltd, unveiled two new devices - a full touch-screen smartphone dubbed the Z10 and a more traditional physical keyboard version named Q10 - at a launch event in New York on January 30. The company hopes the make-or-break new line will help it win back market share ceded in recent years to the likes of Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, whose Galaxy line is powered by Google Inc’s market-leading Android operating system. The news of Home Depot’s defection sent BlackBerry shares 3.8 percent lower to $15.86 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq on Monday, overshadowing media reports that its Z10 device made a strong debut in the United Arab Emirates on Sunday. Since their unveiling, the devices have been well received in Britain and Canada. The all-important U.S. debut comes next month. Stephen Holmes, a spokesman for Home Depot, confirmed an earlier report on the Apple Insider blog site that the retailer was issuing iPhones to almost 10,000 executives, managers and corporate staffers who currently use the BlackBerry. He declined to say when the company had begun this process, and whether the decision was made before or after the launch of the new BlackBerry 10. “We are replacing the current base of BlackBerry technology with iPhone, but these are not the mobile devices used in our stores,” Holmes said. The Apple Insider report said the move would have no impact on the 60,000 rugged Motorola smartphones used by Home Depot’s store employees. Those devices provide mobile point-of-sale, analytical, walkie-talkie and traditional telephony services. BlackBerry declined to comment directly on Home Depot’s move, but in an email said it is seeing strong demand for its new Z10. “We have over 2,700 unique businesses in North America already registered for our BlackBerry 10 Ready Program,” Amy McDowell, a spokeswoman for the company, said. “We are confident that BlackBerry is, and will continue to be, the best solution for corporations managing large smartphone deployments.” BlackBerry’s Toronto-listed shares were down 3.2 percent at C$15.98 at 1:30 p.m. ET (1830 GMT).

111,HD,UPDATE 5-Lowe's margin outlook disappoints; turnaround questioned,"* Analyst calls fiscal-year operating margin outlook “ho-hum” * Earnings per share 26 cents versus analysts’ estimate 23 cents * Sales fall to $11.05 billion, but beat $10.84 billion estimate * Lowe’s sees higher sales in current fiscal year * Lowe’s shares down 1.8 percent; Home Depot dips 0.2 percent By Dhanya Skariachan Feb 25 (Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos Inc’s forecast a fiscal-year operating margin on Monday that analysts said did little to boost confidence in the U.S. housing market or the retailer’s own turnaround. The news overshadowed stronger-than-expected quarterly results and caused some on Wall Street to worry that investors in the second-largest home improvement chain might have to wait longer than they had anticipated to see Lowe’s catch up with larger rival Home Depot Inc. Morningstar analyst Peter Wahlstrom said Lowe’s outlook for an operating margin rise of about 60 basis points in the current fiscal year was “ho-hum.” “That basically means that investors need to wait another year for maybe the Lowe’s outperformance story to take hold,” he said. “People were hoping for that to come in 2013.” Home Depot plans to report results on Tuesday, and most analysts expect the industry leader’s same-store sales to outpace those from Lowe’s for the 15th straight quarter. Lowe’s shares were down 1.8 percent at $37 in afternoon trading, while Home Depot fell 0.2 percent to $65.46. Citi analyst Kate McShane said Lowe’s outlook might be conservative, given that the company expects meaningful same-store sales and gross margin benefits by the second half. Still, she maintained her “neutral” rating on the stock, citing Lowe’s underperformance against Home Depot and a choppy economy. “The lack of incremental visibility on the company’s progress against key initiatives keeps us on the sidelines,” McShane added. Lowe’s said it expected its fiscal-year sales to rise about 4 percent from $50.52 billion in the year ended on Feb. 1. While “home value perception” ratings are the strongest they have been in four years, tight credit conditions and high mortgage delinquencies will restrain the speed at which housing and, therefore, the home improvement industry can grow, Lowe’s Chief Executive Officer Robert Niblock told investors. The housing market has shown some signs of recovery from a collapse that helped push the economy into its worst recession since the Great Depression. Homebuilding added to national economic growth in 2012 for the first time since 2005 and is expected to provide more support this year. “While we see a modest recovery in housing, we see rising interest rates as a threat to home refinancing, a key driver of remodeling,” S&P; Capital IQ analyst Michael Souers said. In its fourth quarter, Lowe’s benefited from rebuilding after Hurricane Sandy and the retailer’s efforts to improve product selection and customer service. As part of its makeover, the company has started offering everyday low prices and products targeted to specific geographic markets. It made its stores more appealing with improved signs, television displays that stream videos on how-to-do projects, and lower racks to make items easier to reach. Lowe’s has also increased its assortment of products available online and started mylowes.com, a site that allows shoppers to save their room dimensions, create a shopping list and set reminders to buy items such as air filters and batteries for smoke alarms.

Bain Capital, Carlyle Group and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, who took the company private for $8.5 billion in 2007, each own about 28 percent of the company. Home Depot continues to hold a 12.4 percent stake in the company, according to HD Supply’s prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday.

Shares of the two companies helped lift the blue-chip Dow as the broader market picked up steam in the early afternoon, sending indexes to fresh intraday records. Comments from a top Federal Reserve official also boosted the market as they eased some concerns that the central bank could start to reduce its stimulus program, known as quantitative easing, or QE. “It looks like with regard to QE, they’re considering a slower exit rather than a faster exit,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T; Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. “That brought some buying into the market this afternoon.” After a 17 percent rally for major indexes since the start of the year, investors are trying to gauge how much further equities can run. Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients dated May 20 that it sees the S&P; 500 at 1,750 by the end of the year - up 5 percent  from Monday’s close - and expects a 12-month rally to 1,825.

The Nasdaq Composite Index added 9.83 points, or 0.28 percent, to 3,506.26. The Dow climbed to an all-time intraday high at 15,418.53, while the S&P; hit 1,674.17. The small- and mid-cap Russell 2000 continued to face technical resistance at the 1,000-point level, but the index hovered around its all-time closing high. JPMorgan Chase & Co shareholders voted to allow Jamie Dimon to keep his chairman title, sending the bank’s shares up 1.7 percent at $53.20. The housing market’s recovery helped Home Depot  report higher quarterly sales and earnings, prompting the world’s largest home improvement chain to raise its sales outlook for the year. Home Depot was the Dow’s biggest percentage gainer, up 3.2 percent at $79.21 after hitting an intraday record high of $79.40. New York Fed President William Dudley said he cannot be sure whether policymakers will next reduce or increase the amount of purchases, due to the “uncertain” economic outlook. The Fed’s current $85 billion per month bond buying program has played a significant role in the market rally and investors have become nervous over when the central bank will alter or halt the program. Investors will be parsing testimony by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke before a congressional panel, the Joint Economic Committee, on Wednesday morning, while the minutes of the Fed’s latest policy-setting meeting will also be released later that day. “Central banks have been flooding the world with liquidity, and one place that’s gone is into the stock markets,” said Brian Gendreau, market strategist at Cetera Financial Group, based in Los Angeles. Still, a reduction or end of the current quantitative easing program wouldn’t necessarily mean the end of the rally, as a better economic outlook should offset the change to monetary policy, Gendreau said.

The major U.S. stock indexes are up about 17 percent for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve’s ultra-loose monetary policy has played a significant role in the rally. The Fed is buying $85 billion in bonds a month, and the market has begun to search for any sign of when the central bank will alter the amount of purchases or halt the program. “Central banks have been flooding the world with liquidity, and one place that’s gone is into the stock markets,” said Brian Gendreau, market strategist at Cetera Financial Group, based in Los Angeles.

However, the expectation of continuing accommodative monetary policy from the Federal Reserve should continue to lend support to equities. “There’s not strong enough evidence one way or another to change monetary policy,” De Gan said, adding that with all the support the Fed has given to equities there are also “fundamental reasons” driving the market.

128,HD,Housing recovery boosts Home Depot results; outlook raised,"(Reuters) - Home Depot Inc (HD.N) reported higher-than-expected quarterly results and raised its sales and profit outlook for the year on Tuesday as the world’s largest home improvement chain benefited from a nascent recovery in the U.S. housing market. The news pushed the retailer’s shares up as much as 3.4 percent to an all-time high and gave fresh evidence that the U.S. housing market was improving after years of weakness. For the first time since 2008, sales to contractors and professional customers grew at a faster pace than those to regular homeowners and other shoppers, Chief Executive Officer Frank Blake said on a conference call. “This quarter’s outperformance from the pro segment is a positive sign” of a housing recovery, Blake said. A bubble in the U.S. housing market was at the core of the 2007-2009 financial crisis. During the downturn, Home Depot’s sales at established stores fell more than 20 percent in such markets as Florida and California. In recent quarters, the company has gotten a boost as housing markets have rebounded in regions where it has a heavy presence. “In the first quarter, we saw less favorable weather compared to last year, but we continue to see benefit from a recovering housing market that drove a stronger-than-expected start to the year for our business,” Blake said. Recent government data showed permits for single-family homes rose 3 percent to 617,000 in April, the highest since May 2008, while newly issued building permits, a gauge of future construction, rose 14.3 percent. Despite cooler-than-usual weather in many parts of the United States at the start of the spring selling season, Home Depot’s sales rose 7.4 percent to $19.12 billion in the first quarter ended on May 5. That topped the analysts’ average estimate of $18.68 billion. Better pricing and customer service have helped Home Depot take market share from smaller rival Lowe’s Cos (LOW.N). The industry leader has also gained from tailoring its marketing to local areas, centralizing distribution centers and shifting more workers to jobs where they serve customers directly. Sales at Home Depot stores open at least a year rose 4.3 percent, including a 4.8 percent increase in the United States. Many on Wall Street expect same-store sales at Lowe’s to be weaker than Home Depot’s for the 16th straight quarter when the smaller chain reports results on Wednesday. Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter said he expected Home Depot’s sales to accelerate this year “given the company’s strong internal momentum and a developing external tailwind in housing.” He has an “outperform” rating on the stock. At the end of 2012, Home Depot had 19 percent of the U.S. home improvement retail market and Lowe's had 16.7 percent, data from Euromonitor International showed. (Related graphic: link.reuters.com/teh38t) Under Blake, Home Depot was quicker than Lowe’s to cut costs in the years after the housing collapse. Net income in the first quarter rose to $1.2 billion, or 83 cents a share, from $1 billion, or 68 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had forecast a profit of 77 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. For the year, the company now expects earnings of $3.52 a share, up from its prior outlook of $3.37. It forecast a sales increase of about 2.8 percent, up from previous expectations of a 2 percent rise. Shares of Home Depot were up 2.8 percent at $78.89 in morning trading after rising as high as $79.40 earlier in the session.

131,HD,Lowe's sales improve after weak start to spring,"(Reuters) - No. 2 home improvement chain Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) reassured investors that sales trends improved significantly in April and May after seeing a weak start to the spring selling season. The news pushed Lowe’s shares to an all-time high and overshadowed the weaker-than-expected first-quarter results the chain reported on Wednesday, as colder-than-usual weather hurt demand for lawn and garden and other seasonal goods. “We do believe that we will make up a significant portion of the sales that we lost in the first quarter,” Chief Executive Robert Niblock said in an interview, referring to more favorable weather trends in the current quarter. Like its larger rival Home Depot Inc (HD.N), Lowe’s said it was seeing strong sales to contractors. For the first time since 2008, sales to contractors and professional customers grew at a faster pace than those to regular homeowners and other shoppers, Home Depot CEO Frank Blake said on Tuesday. “All that just speaks to what you have been hearing about the housing market starting to recover,” Niblock told Reuters. While Wall Street expects the housing market recovery to help both retailers, some analysts predict that Home Depot will continue to outperform Lowe’s on the sales front for a while, partly due to a structural advantage. Home Depot derives 35 percent of its sales from contractors and professional customers, while Lowe’s derives only 25 percent of sales from professional customers, RBC Capital Markets analyst Scot Ciccarelli said. Ciccarelli said it was “hard to close” that gap because Home Depot had more stores than Lowe’s in major metro areas and many of the professional contractors and their businesses were based in those areas. On a conference call, Lowe’s said same-store sales rose about 10 percent in April after falling 10 percent in March. Lowe’s also managed to maintain the momentum in same-store sales in the first three weeks of May, the company said. Lowe’s sales fell 0.5 percent to $13.09 billion in the first quarter ended on May 3, missing the analysts’ average estimate of $13.45 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year dipped 0.7 percent. It was the 16th straight quarter that Lowe’s posted weaker same-store sales than Home Depot. “The spread between Home Depot and Lowe’s (same-store sales) expanded in the first quarter, something we had worried might happen,” said Janney Capital Markets analyst David Strasser. Lowe’s stocked more lawn and garden products than Home Depot and as a result suffered more from the unfavorable weather, Strasser said. At the same time, he said, Home Depot had a greater presence in California, where housing has made a strong comeback. While Lowe’s has been working to improve product selection and customer service, it has yet to turn around its business. If Lowe’s does not close the performance gap with Home Depot by late 2013 or early 2014, investors may conclude that Lowe’s has failed to benefit as much as expected from its exposure to the U.S. housing market, Ciccarelli said by phone. “I would be very surprised if it caught Home Depot in this cycle in terms of same-store sales, market share,” said Chris Bertelsen, chief investment officer of Sarasota-based wealth manager Global Financial Private Capital that owns Lowe’s shares. He wants the company to close more unprofitable stores. As part of its makeover, the company has started offering everyday low prices and products targeted to specific geographic markets. It made its stores more appealing with improved signs, television displays that stream videos on how-to-do projects, and lower racks to make items easier to reach.

Analysts on average expected a profit of 51 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

133,HD,Rona to sell commercial specialty division in $215 mln deal,"June 20 (Reuters) - Home improvement and hardware store chain Rona Inc has struck a deal to sell its plumbing, heating, ventilation and air conditioning business to Emco Corp and expects net proceeds of C$215 million, Rona said on Thursday. Rona, which previously said it was in serious talks with prospective buyers for the unit, is in the midst of a three-year turnaround plan as it struggles with increased competition. The company said it expects to record a pre-tax loss of about C$125 million in the second quarter related to the sale of its Commercial and Professional Market division. The division sells plumbing, heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems to commercial and industrial construction customers. The division operates under various banners across Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia, including Noble, Don Park and MPH Supplies. The deal is subject to regulatory approval. Emco is a wholesaler-distributor of products for the construction industry. Boucherville, Quebec-based Rona transformed itself from a modest hardware distributor to a national retailer in the 1990s. But it stumbled in recent years as U.S.-based Home Depot Inc  and Lowe’s Cos Inc, the world’s top two home-improvement chains, expanded their presence in Canada. Earlier this year Rona reshuffled its board and named a new CEO after it came under pressure from investors following its rejection of an unsolicited C$1.8 billion takeover proposal from Lowe’s. Scotiabank acted as financial adviser to Rona in the deal with Emco, while Norton Rose Fulbright acted as its legal adviser. Rona shares were off 14 Canadian cents at C$10.10 at mid-morning on the Toronto Stock Exchange.",6202013,http://www.reuters.com/article/rona-asset-emco/rona-to-sell-commercial-specialty-division-in-215-mln-deal-idUSL2N0EW0LA20130620
134,HD,UPDATE 1-HD Supply IPO prices below range amid market volatility,"By Olivia Oran June 26 (Reuters) - Industrial and construction supplies company HD Supply Holdings raised $957.2 million in an initial public offering on Wednesday, less than expected, after recent stock market volatility and rising interest rates led some investors to take a cautious approach. The Atlanta, Georgia-based company, backed by Bain Capital, Carlyle Group and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, priced 53.2 million shares at $18. HD Supply had originally hoped to price shares at a range of $22 to $25, although underwriters told investors earlier in the day it was offering shares at a range of $18 to $20, according to a person familiar with the matter. Volatility in the equity markets within the last few weeks, triggered by concerns the Federal Reserve may trim back its stimulus policies, has led several companies to cut or scrap their IPOs. Technology products retailer CDW Corp priced shares at $17 on Wednesday after reducing its target price range to $18 to $17 per share from $23 to $20. Last week, Brazilian cement company Votorantim Cimentos postponed its $3.7 billion U.S. IPO due to market conditions. HD Supply, one of the largest distributors of construction, industrial and maintenance supplies in North America, was trying to capitalize on a rebound in U.S. housing sector stocks which had been strong up until the last several weeks. The housing market recovery encouraged other companies to hold IPOs earlier this year, including home builders TRI Pointe Homes Inc and home builder Taylor Morrison Home Corp , as well as plywood maker Boise Cascade Co. The pickup in housing has been driven largely by record low mortgage rates. Worries that rates could rise have caused concern that the recovery could falter. Shares of homebuilders like PulteGroup Inc and Lennar Corp have each fallen over 15 percent in the last month. HD Supply’s high debt load, which stands at around 7.7 times  earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) may have also caused pushback from some investors. The company will use its proceeds to reduce debt. Bain, Carlyle and CD&R; bought HD Supply out of Home Depot Inc for $8.5 billion in 2007. HD Supply reported $8 billion in revenues for the fiscal year ended February 2013, up 14 percent from the same period a year prior. Adjusted EBITDA rose to $683 million, up 34 percent from the year prior. HD Supply is expected to trade on the Nasdaq on Thursday under the symbol HDS. Bank of America, Barclays, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse led the IPO.",6262013,http://www.reuters.com/article/hdsupply-ipo/update-1-hd-supply-ipo-prices-below-range-amid-market-volatility-idUSL2N0F21XK20130626
135,HD,Home Depot reaps benefits from U.S. housing rebound,"(Reuters) - A recovery in the U.S. housing market helped boost Home Depot Inc’s (HD.N) quarterly profit and sales above analysts’ estimates, prompting the world’s largest home improvement chain to raise its outlook for the fiscal year. The U.S. retailer also reported its first double-digit rise since 1999 in sales at stores open at least a year and had the highest quarterly transaction count in its history, Chief Executive Officer Frank Blake said on Tuesday. Sales were strong across the country, Blake added. The news, which came just days after data showed that U.S. housing starts rose 5.9 percent in July, gave more evidence that the market for homes was healing after years of weakness. “These stronger results demonstrate the sales leadership of the housing/home improvement segment and Home Depot’s strong positioning and execution within it,” said Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter. He said he believed the company’s future sales would also beat estimates as the housing recovery advances. A bubble in the U.S. housing market was at the core of the 2007-2009 financial crisis. During the downturn, Home Depot’s sales at established stores fell more than 20 percent in such markets as Florida and California. In recent quarters, housing has rebounded in those markets and other states where Home Depot has a heavy presence, such as Arizona and Nevada. In May, the company said its sales to contractors and professional customers increased faster than those to individual homeowners and other shoppers for the first time since 2008. “In 2008, the consumer was really focused on core repair and maintenance,” Chief Financial Officer Carol Tome said in an interview. “Fast-forward to 2013: Home prices are better, and as consumers start to see their home price appreciate, they start to view their home as an investment and not an expense.” Home Depot shares, which have outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX and Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI so far this year, were unchanged at $75.21 on Tuesday afternoon. At least one analyst recommended selling the stock. “While we see continued near-term margin improvement on strong cost control, we think rising interest rates threaten housing turnover, limiting sales growth,” said S&P; Capital IQ analyst Michael Souers, who believes Home Depot shares are expensive at current levels. But Tome said: “We have got a long way to grow” in terms of sales. Net earnings rose to $1.80 billion, or $1.24 a share, in the second quarter ended August 4 from $1.53 billion, or $1.01 a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $1.21 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 9.5 percent to $22.5 billion, topping the analysts’ average estimate of $21.8 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 10.7 percent, including an 11.4 percent increase in the United States. For the year, the company raised its earnings forecast to $3.60 a share from $3.52. It said it expected a sales rise of about 4.5 percent, up from previous expectations of a 2.8 percent increase. Home Depot has also benefited from its own efforts to improve customer service and attract shoppers with more compelling prices than its rivals. It has tailored its marketing to local areas, centralized distribution centers and shifted more workers to jobs where they serve customers directly. As a result, Home Depot has gained market share from rival Lowe’s Cos (LOW.N), which is due to report results on Wednesday.

140,HD,UPDATE 4-Lowe's narrows sales gap with Home Depot,"By Dhanya Skariachan Aug 21 (Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos Inc reported stronger-than-expected quarterly results as the housing market’s recovery encouraged Americans to spend more on their homes, and the No. 2 home improvement chain narrowed its sales gap against rival Home Depot Inc. The results prompted Lowe’s to raise its fiscal-year outlook, and its shares hit an all-time high on a split adjusted basis on Wednesday. The news came the day after Home Depot also reported rosy results, giving further proof of the strength in the U.S. housing market recovery. Lowe’s sales at stores open at least a year rose 9.6 percent in the second quarter ended on Aug. 2 but trailed the 10.7 percent increase at Home Depot. However, that is the narrowest gap in same-store sales between the two retailers since the third quarter of 2010, BMO Capital Markets analyst Wayne Hood said. “This could signal that (Lowe’s) product line reviews and merchandise assortment overhaul are starting to work,” Hood said. Home improvement chains, whose sales crumbled during the housing downturn, are enjoying a comeback as rising prices for homes have led to renewed interest in renovating them. “We think both companies are on a pretty good surfboard in front of a pretty good tsunami,” said Bill Smead, a portfolio manager at the Smead Value Fund in Seattle. U.S. home resales rose in July to a more than three-year high, the National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday, suggesting a sharp rise in borrowing costs has had only a limited impact on the housing recovery so far. “The rate increases will likely take some steam out of the recent housing market rebounds, but shouldn’t derail it as long as job gains persist, homes continue to appreciate and rates rise more gradually going forward,” Lowe’s Chief Executive Officer Robert Niblock said on a conference call. Smead’s firm holds Home Depot shares and sees better longer-term prospects for the industry leader, citing its strong management team, free cash flow and balance sheet. Some analysts also say Home Depot will continue to outperform Lowe’s on the sales front for a while, in part because it derives much more revenue from the key contractor and professional customer group. These customers account for 35 percent of Home Depot’s sales, compared with 25 percent at Lowe’s. Some analysts have said it is hard to close that gap quickly because Home Depot has more stores than Lowe’s in major metropolitan areas, where many of the professional contractors are based. Lowe’s recently agreed to buy several neighborhood hardware and garden stores in California from Orchard Supply Hardware Stores Corp, which Sears Holdings Corp spun off less than two years ago. The deal gave Lowe’s access to Orchard’s prime locations in high-density markets in California, an area where it was under-represented. Shares of Lowe’s were up 4.4 percent at $46.05 in afternoon trading after rising as high as $47.25 earlier in the session. Home Depot dipped 0.2 percent to $74.11. Both stocks trade around 19 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, making them more expensive than many of their retail peers. PLAYING CATCH-UP Lowe’s net earnings rose to $941 million, or 88 cents a share, in the second quarter from $747 million, or 64 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts were expecting a profit of 79 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales increased 10.3 percent to $15.71 billion, exceeding analysts’ estimates of $15.06 billion. For the fiscal year ending Jan. 31, Lowe’s said it expected total sales to rise about 5 percent, while it had previously called for a 4 percent increase. It raised its earnings-per-share forecast to about $2.10 from $2.05. Home Depot was quicker than Lowe’s to cut costs during the recession. In recent years, it has also benefited from its efforts to improve customer service and attract shoppers with more compelling prices than its rivals. It has tailored its marketing to local areas, centralized distribution centers and shifted more workers to jobs where they serve customers directly. After losing share to Home Depot for several quarters, Lowe’s laid out a turnaround plan. As part of its makeover, the smaller company started offering everyday low prices and products targeted to specific geographic markets. It made its stores more appealing with improved signs, television displays that stream videos on how-to-do projects, and lower racks to make items easier to reach.

141,HD,Home Depot to tap health insurance exchanges for part-timers,"(Reuters) - Home Depot Inc is shifting medical coverage for part-time workers to new public marketplace exchanges ahead of new benefits requirements under the U.S. Affordable Care Act, a spokesman said on Thursday. The world’s largest home improvement retail chain announced its move shortly after a similar announcement from Trader Joe’s Co, a popular privately held grocery chain. Home Depot’s change would affect roughly 20,000 part-time workers who previously had chosen the limited liability medical plan the company offered, spokesman Stephen Holmes said. After December 31, companies can no longer offer those plans under the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. “We’re going to shift them over to the public exchanges, where there are more options,” Holmes said. The public exchanges being set up under ACA will allow individuals to buy government-subsidized healthcare based on income. Enrollment begins on October 1. Until now, many restaurants and retailers offered workers limited liability plans that often provided less than $5,000 in coverage. Experts have said exchanges would provide more comprehensive coverage that may not cost more because government tax credits will help some workers offset premiums. Some employers are opting to offer coverage through private health insurance changes. Walgreen Co, the largest U.S. drugstore, and more than a dozen other large employers have said they would offer their employee insurance for 2014 through the Aon Hewitt Corporate Health Exchange.

The change would affect the roughly 20,000 part-time workers who previously had chosen the limited liability medical coverage offered by the company, spokesman Stephen Holmes said. Companies can no longer offer those plans under the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The public exchanges being set up under ACA will allow individuals to buy government-subsidized healthcare based on income.

143,HD,UPDATE 2-Home Depot to tap health insurance exchanges for part-timers,"Sept 19 (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc is shifting medical coverage for part-time workers to new public marketplace exchanges ahead of new benefits requirements under the U.S. Affordable Care Act, a spokesman said on Thursday. The world’s largest home improvement retail chain announced its move shortly after a similar announcement from Trader Joe’s Co, a popular privately held grocery chain. Home Depot’s change would affect roughly 20,000 part-time workers who previously had chosen the limited liability medical plan the company offered, spokesman Stephen Holmes said. After Dec. 31, companies can no longer offer those plans under the health law, also known as Obamacare. “We’re going to shift them over to the public exchanges, where there are more options,” Holmes said. The public exchanges being set up under the law will allow individuals to buy government-subsidized healthcare based on income. Enrollment begins on Oct. 1. Until now, many restaurants and retailers offered workers limited liability plans that often provided less than $5,000 in coverage. Home Depot’s plans for part-time workers provided coverage of up to $20,000 depending on the plan and were administered by Aetna Inc. Experts have said exchanges would provide more comprehensive coverage that may not cost more because government tax credits will help some workers offset premiums. Some employers are opting to offer coverage through private health insurance changes. Walgreen Co, the largest U.S. drugstore, and more than a dozen other large employers have said they would offer their employee insurance for 2014 through the Aon Hewitt Corporate Health Exchange. Home Depot employs about 340,000 people and will continue to offer healthcare benefits to full-time employees, who will be paying more for that coverage next year due to higher healthcare costs, Holmes said.",9202013,http://www.reuters.com/article/healthcare-exchanges-homedepot/update-2-home-depot-to-tap-health-insurance-exchanges-for-part-timers-idUSL2N0HF22H20130920

A recovery in the U.S. housing market helped Home Depot top profit and sales estimates for the third quarter, prompting the No. 1 home improvement chain to raise its fiscal-year outlook for the third time this year. Its stock hit a lifetime high at $82.25. At midday, Home Depot was up 1.7 percent at $81, supporting the Dow and the S&P; 500. The major indexes continued to face resistance at key levels a day after the Dow traded above 16,000 and the S&P; 500 topped 1,800 for the first time. Both indexes were unable to hold those levels at Monday’s close. Markets are seen trading in a tight range as investors wait for further clues from the Federal Reserve on how soon it may begin reducing its stimulus program. “I’d say there’s a very low probability the Fed does anything between now and the end of the year,” said Dan Veru, chief investment officer of Palisade Capital Management, which has $4.5 billion in assets and is based in Fort Lee, New Jersey. “I think we’re going to be sort of this drift-up market between now and the end of the year. If you’re not in the market, you’re looking for any modest pullback to get in. There just is a lot of cash and a lot of managers that are underperforming because they’ve been perhaps too cautious.” The Fed’s stimulus and ultra-low interest-rate policy have helped the S&P; 500 gain more than 25 percent so far in 2013, which would make it the best year for the index in a decade. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 26.26 points, or 0.16 percent, at 16,002.28. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  was up 0.43 of a point, or 0.02 percent, at 1,791.96. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 1.59 points, or 0.04 percent, at 3,950.66. Investors will look for any changes in tone from the Fed as Chicago Fed President Charles Evans speaks on current economic conditions and monetary policy at 2:15 p.m. EST (1915 GMT) and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke speaks on “Communication and Monetary Policy” at 7 p.m. (0000 GMT). On Wednesday, minutes from the Fed’s October meeting are scheduled to be released. Among the day’s drags, Best Buy reported a quarterly profit, reversing a year-ago loss, boosted by tight cost controls. But there was also concern about pressure on margins during the holiday season and the stock fell 8.4 percent to $39.90. At Monday’s close, Best Buy was up 268 percent so far this year, among the S&P; 500’s top percentage gainers for the year.

Trina Solar Ltd posted a profit after eight quarters of losses as solar panel prices held steady after a four-year decline and the company cut manufacturing costs, driving its stock up 2.1 percent $16.53.

147,HD,Home Depot raises forecast as Americans spruce up homes,"(Reuters) - Home Depot Inc (HD.N) raised its 2013 forecast for the third time this year as rising home prices encourage more Americans to invest in their properties and complete delayed projects. Shares of the No.1 U.S. home improvement chain rose 3 percent after the company’s quarterly profit beat analysts’ estimates for the sixth quarter in a row. Home Depot’s third-quarter results gave fresh evidence that the U.S. housing market continues to heal after years of weakness. A bubble in the sector was at the core of the 2007-2009 financial crisis. “The housing market continues to be a positive,” Chief Executive Francis Blake said on a post-earnings conference call. Blake said that although private fixed residential investment as a percentage of GDP improved again this past quarter to 3.2 percent, it remained well below the 60-year average of about 4.6 percent. U.S. home prices have risen since early 2012 and economists have singled out housing as one of the bright spots of the economic recovery. Prices jumped again in August despite a recent rise in mortgage rates and slowing demand for new homes, according to the S&P;/Case Shiller composite index. Chief Financial Officer Carol Tome said she did not expect a decline in home prices, which have been the biggest contributor to the company’s sales growth this year. The company has also improved distribution, cut costs and tailored marketing and merchandising efforts to local markets. Smaller rival Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) is due to report results on Wednesday. “If every earnings report was like Home Depot, we would have the easiest job in the world,” Janney Capital Markets analyst David Strasser wrote in a note to clients.

153,HD,Lowe's outlook disappoints; retailer still lags Home Depot,"(Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) reported slightly lower-than-expected quarterly earnings and gave a disappointing fiscal-year outlook, underscoring the No. 2 home improvement retailer’s struggle to catch up with market leader Home Depot. Wednesday’s news came the day after strong results from Home Depot Inc (HD.N), which increased its forecast for the year for the third time in three quarters as rising housing prices encouraged more people to invest in their homes. Lowe’s results also made some analysts wonder if rising interest rates would take some steam out of the recent housing market rebound that has encouraged homeowners to take up more expensive remodeling projects. “In addition to missing earnings-per-share estimates, interest rates are rising and housing is slowing, calling into question continued outperformance in this space in 2014,” Janney Capital Markets analyst David Strasser said. A report from the National Association of Realtors on Wednesday showed sales of existing homes fell 3.2 percent in October. The median price of a previously owned home rose 12.8 percent from a year ago. Lowe’s shares were down 5.1 percent at $47.85 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Home Depot fell 0.5 percent to $80.01. On a conference call, Lowe’s executives said discretionary spending on larger home projects was still far below pre-recession peaks. They also said competition in the appliance market had eaten into the company’s gross margin. Even though Lowe’s issued an outlook below analysts’ estimates, Chief Executive Officer Robert Niblock said the home improvement industry was poised for growth this quarter and for “further acceleration” in the next fiscal year. In an interview, Niblock said the company had not seen interest rates hurting the recovery in home improvement sales so far. Lowe’s, once a Wall Street darling, is not just a victim of the vagaries in the housing market. It was slower than Home Depot to cut costs during the most recent U.S. recession. Some analysts also say Home Depot will continue to outperform Lowe’s on the sales front for a while, in part because it derives much more revenue from the key contractor and professional customer group. These customers account for 35 percent of Home Depot’s sales, compared with 25 percent at Lowe’s. Some analysts say it is hard to close that gap quickly because Home Depot has more stores than Lowe’s in major metropolitan areas, where many of the professional contractors are based. Sales at Lowe’s stores open at least a year rose 6.2 percent in the third quarter ended November 1. It was the 18th straight quarter that the company posted weaker same-store sales than Home Depot. At the end of 2012, Home Depot had 18.7 percent of the U.S. home improvement market, while Lowe’s had 15.2 percent, data from Euromonitor International showed. The research firm expects Home Depot to have a 19.2 percent share and Lowe’s to have 15.6 percent by the end of this year. In recent years, Home Depot has benefited from efforts to improve customer service and win shoppers with more compelling prices than its rivals. It has tailored its marketing to local areas, centralized distribution centers and shifted more workers to jobs where they serve shoppers directly. After losing share to Home Depot for several quarters, Lowe’s laid out a turnaround plan, offering everyday low prices and products targeted to specific geographic markets. Lowe’s also made its stores more appealing with improved signs, television displays that stream videos on how-to-do projects, and lower racks to make items easier to reach. For the fiscal year ending January 31, Lowe’s raised its earnings forecast to about $2.15 a share from $2.10. However, the new outlook fell short of the analysts’ average estimate of $2.19, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The retailer also increased its outlook for sales growth for the year to about 6 percent from 5 percent. Net earnings in the third quarter rose to $499 million, or 47 cents a share, from $396 million, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts were expecting 48 cents a share. Sales increased 7.3 percent to $12.96 billion, topping the analysts’ average estimate of $12.72 billion.

For the fiscal year ending Jan. 31, Lowe’s raised its earnings forecast to about $2.15 a share from $2.10. However, the new outlook fell short of the analysts’ average estimate of $2.19, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The retailer also increased its outlook for sales growth for the year to about 6 percent from 5 percent. Net earnings in the third quarter rose to $499 million, or 47 cents a share, from $396 million, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts were expecting 48 cents a share. Sales increased 7.3 percent to $12.96 billion, topping the analysts’ average estimate of $12.72 billion.

Seven out of the 10 S&P; 500 sector indexes ended lower, led by financials and industrials, while consumer discretionaries led on the upside. The day’s data showed gains in U.S. home prices slowed in December, according to the S&P;/Case-Shiller index, while the consumer confidence index fell more than expected in February. Selling picked up slightly late in the session as traders unwound positions after the S&P; 500 failed to break above Monday’s intraday record high of 1,858.71, analysts said.

Home Depot shares jumped 4 percent to close at $80.98, giving the biggest boost to both the Dow and the S&P; 500. Home Depot’s earnings beat expectations, though sales fell more than expected in the fourth quarter. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 27.48 points or 0.17 percent, to end at 16,179.66.

Shares of Macy’s Inc gained 6 percent to $56.25 after the department store operator reported a drop in January sales, but said fourth-quarter earnings rose from the previous year. While many analysts have pinned the weakness to harsh winter weather rather than deteriorating fundamentals, the retail earnings suggest that spending has not dried up. “There are a couple of credible pieces of information that didn’t get caught in the snow drifts,” said Fred Dickson, chief market strategist at D.A. Davidson & Co in Lake Oswego, Oregon. “Consumers are spending.” The S&P; retail index rose 1.9 percent, while the consumer discretionary index gained 0.5 percent.

159,HD,Home Depot sees post-winter repairs boosting spring sales,"(Reuters) - Winter storms and record cold in much of the United States hurt Home Depot’s (HD.N) fourth quarter sales of everything from lumber to building materials. But the world’s largest home improvement chain expects to benefit this spring when Americans begin to repair snow damaged homes and gardens. “We know firsthand that many homeowners have some major repairs ahead of them which suggest we should have a great spring selling season,” Chief Financial Officer Carol Tome said on Tuesday, adding that sales at stores open at least a year were up so far in February despite harsh winter weather. The comments came after Home Depot missed sales estimates and relied on tight cost controls to beat profit estimates in the fourth quarter, which ended February 2. Some Wall Street analysts said the retailer held up pretty well in the quarter plagued by inclement weather in its key U.S. market and weakness in the Canadian currency. Home Depot shares were up 2.4 percent at $79.77 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. Home Depot faced tough comparisons with the final quarter of its previous financial year when repairs and rebuilding after Superstorm Sandy boosted sales. In the latest fourth quarter, overall sales fell 3 percent to $17.70 billion, missing the analysts’ estimate of $17.91 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 4.4 percent, including a 4.9 percent rise at its U.S. stores. The latest period had one week less than the prior-year quarter. RBC Capital Markets analyst Scot Ciccarelli said he was cheered by the retailer’s sales at its established stores and recommended Home Depot over rival Lowe’s (LOW.N), due to report results on Wednesday. Others worried whether the sales weakness at Home Depot indicated the recent U.S. housing recovery was losing momentum. Severe cold weather and a shortage of houses on the market had pushed U.S. home resales to an 18-month low in January. “We believe weather had a modest impact, but affordability remains stretched, household formation soft and younger people are not in the market due to higher education debt,” wrote Janney analyst David Strasser, who has a “neutral” rating on the company. Home Depot CEO Frank Blake expects the housing recovery to continue, but does not see all housing metrics sustaining 2013 growth rates. He expects home prices to rise but at a lower rate. Home Depot was faster to begin cutting costs than its smaller rival Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) during and after the most recent U.S. recession. It has particularly gained from its move to have more centralized distribution centers. It managed to cut total operating costs by 4 percent in the quarter. Home Depot has also managed inventory tightly and found creative ways like using less energy in its stores to save money. It also has benefited from its slower expansion strategy. Under Blake, Home Depot closed smaller, secondary stores and upgraded service and products in its core “big box” stores to win back market share from Lowe’s. Net earnings were $1.01 billion, or 73 cents a share, compared with $1.02 billion, or 68 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts were looking for a profit of 71 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Some analysts had raised concerns about inclement weather hurting traffic to its stores in the United States in December and January. For the current fiscal year, the company expects earnings of $4.38 a share on sales growth of about 4.8 percent. It sees same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, rising about 4.6 percent.

The S&P; 500, which hit an intraday record high on Monday, remained points from its all-time closing high of 1,848.38 but still in negative territory for the year. Home Depot shares rose 2.8 percent to $80.09, giving the S&P; 500 its biggest boost. The Dow component’s earnings beat expectations, though sales fell more than expected in the fourth quarter. Macy’s Inc jumped 6.3 percent to $56.41 after the retailer reported a drop in January sales, but said fourth-quarter earnings rose from the prior year. “There are a couple of credible pieces of information that didn’t get caught in the snow drifts,” said Fred Dickson, chief market strategist, D.A.

In the latest economic data, the S&P;/Case-Shiller index of home prices rose slightly more than expected in December, but February consumer confidence fell more than expected. The confidence report was the latest in a string of economic data that came in below forecasts.

162,HD,"WRAPUP 1-U.S. home price rise momentum weakens, consumer confidence falls","* S&P;/Case-Shiller home price index up 0.8 pct in December * Conference board says consumer confidence slipped in February * Toll Brothers’, Home Depot’s results cloud housing outlook By Rodrigo Campos Feb 25 (Reuters) - U.S. home price gains slowed in December, according to a closely watched housing survey on Tuesday that underscored a loss of momentum in the housing recovery, while consumer confidence drifted lower this month. The S&P;/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index rose a seasonally adjusted 0.8 percent in December, down from a 0.9 percent rise in November. For the 12 months to December, prices were up 13.4 percent, below the peak of 13.7 percent in November and the first decline in the rate of change since June. “Recent housing data has shown that activity at the outset of 2014 has slowed down,” said Jefferies economists in a note regarding the Case-Shiller gauge. “It is possible that the index has reached a near-term top.” Recent data have shown the housing recovery losing steam in the early part of the year. Housing starts dropped 16 percent in January, the biggest decline in almost three years, and home resales slid to a 1-1/2 year low last month. Bitter cold and serial snowstorms this winter have been blamed in part for the weakness in the housing sector, though analysts say higher mortgage rates and low inventories have hurt as well. On Tuesday, Toll Brothers, the largest U.S. luxury homebuilder, reported a fall in quarterly orders for the first time in three years as a severe winter deterred buyers. Home Depot’s higher-than-expected profit came in as cost cuts offset weak sales. A Reuters poll showed U.S. home price inflation, as measured by the S&P;/Case-Shiller index, is seen slowing to less than 7 percent this year as mortgage rates rise and there is a gradual transition away from a market driven by institutional buyers looking for bargains. A sentiment survey on Tuesday suggested consumers were wary of future economic conditions. Consumer confidence slipped in February, according to a private sector report. The Conference Board, an industry group, said its index of consumer attitudes fell to 78.1 from a downwardly revised 79.4 in January. Economists in a Reuters poll had expected 80.0. “While expectations have fluctuated over recent months, current conditions have continued to trend upward,” Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at The Conference Board, said in a statement. “This suggests that consumers believe the economy has improved, but they do not foresee it gaining considerable momentum in the months ahead.”",2252014,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-economy/wrapup-1-u-s-home-price-rise-momentum-weakens-consumer-confidence-falls-idUSL1N0LU1F220140225

Major indexes had traded lower for much of the session, pressured by some disappointing data, but turned higher in midday trading. The S&P; climbed to record intraday levels on Monday, but the index pulled back in the afternoon and failed to close at a record. The benchmark index is currently 0.5 percent under its record. “We’re not being aggressive, since valuations aren’t spectacular here, but this certainly isn’t a time to run to cash,” said Rex Macey, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust in Atlanta, Georgia. “We expect we’ll take two steps forward and one step back for a while.” In the latest economic data, home prices rose slightly more than expected in December, according to the S&P;/Case-Shiller index, but February consumer confidence fell more than expected, dropping to 78.1 from 80.7. The confidence report was the latest in a string of economic data that came in below forecasts. While many analysts pin the weakness to harsh winter weather rather than weakening fundamentals, trading are looking for evidence the market’s levels are justified. “We’re waiting to see how much of this weakness is on weather, since if the market gets spooked we could see a big pullback,” said Macey, who helps oversee about $20 billion. “However, you look ahead to 2015, the market likes what it sees, so we would view any pullback as a buying opportunity.” Home Depot rose 2.3 percent to $79.65. The Dow component’s earnings beat expectations, though sales fell more than expected in the fourth quarter. Macy’s Inc gained 4.9 percent to $55.65 after the retailer reported a drop in January sales, though its fourth-quarter earnings rose from the prior year. The S&P; retail index rose 1.6 percent.

Lowe’s shares rose more than 6 percent in early trading, after the company reported that net sales increased 5.6 percent to $11.66 billion in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 31. Home Depot on Tuesday reported a 3 percent decline in sales in the same period, which was marked by winter storms and record cold in much of North America. Lowe’s big rival is more dependent on contractors, who had trouble working on projects in the stormy quarter. “When extreme winter weather arrived late in the quarter, our distribution network responded quickly and efficiently to move product where it was most needed,” Lowe’s CEO Robert Niblock said in a statement on Wednesday. Demand was strong for products such snow blowers, space heaters and fittings to fix broken pipes, the company said. Home Depot’s results had raised concerns that the U.S. housing recovery was losing momentum. But Niblock said Lowe’s continued to see strength in “recovery markets” such as California, Arizona and Florida. “With consumers more willing to invest in their homes, the job and income growth forecasted for 2014 should provide the wherewithal for continued home improvement spending,” Niblock said on a call with analysts. The U.S. Commerce Department said on Wednesday that sales of new single-family homes surged to a 5-1/2 year high in January. Lowe’s, which struggled to catch up with Home Depot after the recession, has tried to arrest market-share losses by offering discounts and products aimed at specific regions. The company posted a 3.9 percent rise in comparable store sales in the fourth quarter. It also said its board had authorized an additional $5 billion share repurchase program Lowe’s gross margin expanded to 34.67 percent in the quarter ended Jan. 31 from 34.27 a year earlier. “We believe that Lowe’s has made significant operational strides, and is now positioned to benefit from its investments in its store resets and product line reviews,” Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter wrote in a note to clients. Lowe’s reported a 6.3 percent rise in fourth-quarter net income to $306 million, or 29 cents per share, up from $288 million, or 26 cents per share, a year earlier. “For businesses that are this mature, to find growth like this is fairly difficult,” Morningstar analyst Jaime Katz said. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 31 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Home Depot’s net profit fell about 1 percent in the quarter. Lowe’s said it expected 2014 total sales to rise by about 5 percent. That translates to about $56.07 billion. The company also forecast earnings of about $2.60 per share for the year ending Jan. 30, 2015. Analysts on average were expecting $2.64 per share on sales of $56.25 billion. Lowe’s shares were up 5.2 percent at $50.64 in late-morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They had risen about 34 percent in the year up to Tuesday’s close. Home Depot’s shares, which were up 1.9 percent at $82.50, rose about 27 percent in the same period. Lowe’s shares were trading at 18.03 times forward earnings as of Tuesday’s close, while Home Depot shares were trading at 17.54 times.

177,HD,"UPDATE 3-Home Depot says May sales ""robust"" on post-winter demand","* Maintains full-year sales growth forecast * Says most sales lost in 1st qtr to be realized in 2nd qtr * Shares rise 2.7 pct   (Adds CEO comment, details; updates shares) By Maria Ajit Thomas May 20 (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc, the world’s largest home improvement chain, said its sales were “robust” in May and that it expected to realize in the current quarter most of the sales lost in the first quarter due to a severe winter in the United States. Shares of the company, which reported lower-than-expected first-quarter sales, rose 2.7 percent in morning trading on Tuesday. Home Depot said its sales of landscape items and products such as concrete were improving as a result of repairs needed after the harsh winter weather. The company gets much of its business from building contractors, who are vulnerable to weather-related disruptions. Spring is also an important time for the company, as households prepare their gardens and get set for the barbecue season. Home Depot maintained its sales growth forecast of 4.8 percent for the year ending January, but analysts were skeptical.

U.S. homebuilder sentiment weakened unexpectedly in May to its lowest in a year, the National Association of Home Builders said last week. Sales of previously owned homes fell each month in the first quarter, while new home sales declined in February and March.

Home Depot rival Lowe’s Cos Inc will report its results on Wednesday. Home Depot also raised its full-year earnings forecast to $4.42 per share from $4.38 per share.

The world’s largest home improvement chain gets much of its business from building contractors, who are vulnerable to weather-related disruptions. Spring is also an important time for Home Depot, as households prepare their gardens and get set for the barbecue season. Home Depot shares fell 1.4 percent in premarket trading. The company maintained its sales growth forecast of 4.8 percent for the year ending January, but analysts were skeptical. A slowing recovery in the U.S. housing market could make it difficult for Home Depot to meet its reiterated sales growth forecast for the year, they said. “We remain neutral as we worry that a weaker housing market will impact sales as the year progresses,” Janney Capital Markets analyst David Strasser wrote in a note. Home Depot said it had “solid results” in markets that were not affected by harsh winter weather. Brian Sozzi, chief executive of Belus Capital Advisors, said slowing U.S. home sales have left Home Depot stores with high inventory of building supplies such as lumber, plywood and roofing material. U.S. homebuilder sentiment weakened unexpectedly in May to its lowest in a year, the National Association of Home Builders said last week. Sales of previously owned homes fell each month in the first quarter, while new home sales declined in February and March. Home Depot rival Lowe’s Cos Inc will report its results on Wednesday.

With the day’s gains, the S&P; 500 ended within 10 points of its all-time intraday high of 1,991.39 reached on July 24. The Nasdaq Composite extended Monday’s gains and ended on Tuesday at yet another 14-year high. Apple Inc was among the most heavily traded names of the day after the stock hit $100 for the first time since its seven-for-one split in June. The stock climbed 1.4 percent to a new split-adjusted closing high of $100.53. Apple contributed the most to the gains of both the S&P; 500 and the Nasdaq Composite in Tuesday’s session. Consumer discretionary shares led advances in the S&P; 500 as a string of positive earnings reports lifted the stocks of major retailers. Home Depot Inc rose 5.6 percent, its largest daily percentage gain since May 2009, to close at a record $88.23 The stock also set an intraday lifetime high of $88.98. The rally occurred after the world’s largest home improvement retailer beat Wall Street’s earnings expectations. Shares of Lowe’s Cos, a Home Depot rival, rose 2.1 percent to $51.52. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 80.85 points, or 0.48 percent, to close at 16,919.59. The S&P; 500  gained 9.86 points, or 0.50 percent, to end at 1,981.60. The Nasdaq Composite added 19.20 points, or 0.43 percent, to finish at 4,527.51, its highest close since March 31, 2000. Encouraging data on the economic front gave the market another boost, driving the PHLX housing sector index up 1.7 percent. Housing starts posted their strongest rebound in eight months in July, topping expectations and adding another data point to suggest optimism is returning among homebuilders. That helped investors gain confidence in the face of continuing tensions along the Ukraine-Russia border, which have pressured markets for weeks. “A lot of the geopolitical concerns with the Middle East, Russia and Ukraine have dissipated, and the combination of that with good economic data and strong corporate results is making investors move stocks higher,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York. “We’re finally starting to see that strength in the housing market that we were expecting to get in the second quarter.” Quarterly results sent shares of discount retailer TJX Cos Inc up 8.7 percent to $58.56 and pushed Dick’s Sporting Goods shares up 1.6 percent to $44.21. In contrast to retailers’ overall strength, shares of Elizabeth Arden Inc sank 23.3 percent to $15.05 after the company reported the biggest quarterly loss in its history. About 4.5 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, compared with the five-day average of 5.2 billion.

The dollar climbed smartly as the euro sank to a nine-month low against the greenback. U.S. Treasuries yields rose.

The MSCI All Country Index was up 0.46 percent at 428.37. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares ended up 0.57 percent, led by gains in Germany, where the blue-chip DAX index was up just under 1 percent. Traders were encouraged by economic news while on alert for central banker comments for indications of interest rate moves after years of rock-bottom benchmark borrowing rates. The dollar rallied, benefiting from U.S. economic data and the euro zone’s current account surplus in June. The euro dipped to a nine-month low of $1.3314. The U.S. dollar index  rose 0.37 percent to a high last seen nearly a year ago. U.S. housing starts rebounded strongly in July, pointing to economic momentum. Groundbreaking surged 15.7 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted 1.09 million annual unit pace, after two straight months of declines. Separately, the Labor Department said its U.S. Consumer Price Index edged up 0.1 percent last month as declining energy costs partially offset increases in food and rents. The CPI had increased 0.3 percent in June. The benign inflation data gave Treasuries prices a fleeting boost. Benchmark 10-year Treasuries fell 4/32 of a point in price to yield of 2.40 percent. The 30-year bond dropped 10/32 of a point in price, pushing the yield up to 3.21 percent. U.S. crude oil and Brent crude futures  dropped after giving up early gains as recovering Libyan output, sustained Iraqi production and weak demand offset concerns about threats to supply. Brent touched 14-month lows at $101.17, but traded late off just 4 cents at $101.56. U.S. crude finished at $94.48, down 2 percent. Investors looked ahead to Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve releases minutes from the July 29-30 Fed policymaking meeting, as well as Fed Chair Janet Yellen’s speech on Friday at a gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. “In the minutes, people will be looking for an exit strategy, but given data we have had, no one is expecting it to come sooner than previously expected. Fed futures are looking to September 2015 and expectations in the market come around that time frame, which is late 2015,” said Thomas Simons, money market economist at Jefferies LLC in New York.

186,HD,Home Depot says U.S. housing recovery to boost sales in second half,"(Reuters) - Home Depot Inc said it expected same-store sales to grow faster in the second half of the year as customers renovate homes with big-ticket purchases such as wood and laminate flooring in a recovering U.S. housing market. Shares of the world’s largest home improvement chain rose as much as 6.5 percent to an all-time high of $88.99, adding more than $7 billion to the company’s market value after it also reported better-than-expected quarterly results.  An improving U.S. jobs market is encouraging people to undertake larger home remodeling projects, David Crowe, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, said in July. (bit.ly/1w5iXUB) People also spent more on repairing winter-related damage to their houses, helping Home Depot recover most of sales it lost in the first quarter, Wedbush Securities analyst Seth Basham wrote in a note on Tuesday. Home Depot expects same-store sales growth in the second half to be 80 basis points higher than the first half, Chief Financial Officer Carol Tome said on a conference call.  The company, however, maintained its full-year sales growth forecast of about 4.8 percent, which Canaccord Genuity analyst Laura Champine called “somewhat conservative.” She said Home Depot was expected to gain market share on the strength of its product assortment and in-store execution.  The company controlled 19.2 percent of the U.S. home improvement market in 2013, up from 17 percent in 2006, according to Euromonitor International. In the period, smaller rival Lowe’s Cos Inc’s share grew to 15.6 percent from 12 percent. Lowe’s, the world’s second-largest home improvement company, is scheduled to report results on Wednesday.  Lowe’s shares rose 3 percent to $51.98 on Tuesday.  Tome said there was a “nice recovery” in demand from building contractors as “customers clearly feel better about investing in their homes.” Home Depot gets much of its business from building contractors.  Purchases of over $900 rose 8.4 percent in the second quarter ended Aug. 3, driven by sales of appliances, windows, water heaters, wood and laminate flooring.  U.S. housing starts rebounded strongly in July, Commerce Department data showed on Tuesday, signaling that the housing market is regaining its footing after being hurt by last year’s runup in interest rates. Home Depot, however, said it was concerned about the availability of mortgage financing, given that a third of Americans aged 18-36 were living with their parents. “Something has got to move on mortgage financing reform ... we continue to pay real close attention to that,” Tome said. Home Depot’s same-store sales rose 5.8 percent in the second quarter, higher than the 4.4 percent analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix had expected. Same-store sales grew 6.4 percent in the United States, where Home Depot has more than 85 percent of its stores. “In the second quarter, our spring seasonal business rebounded, and we saw strong performance in the core of the store and across all of our geographies,” Chief Executive Frank Blake said in a statement on Tuesday. A severe winter had delayed the onset of spring in the United States, hurting Home Depot’s first-quarter sales. Spring is an important time for home improvement retailers, as customers begin to repair snow-damaged homes and gardens and get set for the barbecue season. Home Depot raised its full-year profit forecast to $4.52 per share from $4.42. The revised forecast includes the impact of a $3.5 billion share buyback plan.

Groundbreaking surged 15.7 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted 1.09 million annual unit pace, after two straight months of declines. Separately, the Labor Department said its U.S. Consumer Price Index edged up 0.1 percent last month as declining energy costs partially offset increases in food and rents. The CPI had increased 0.3 percent in June. The benign inflation data gave Treasuries prices a boost that then petered out and left prices off or unchanged in early-afternoon New York trade. The bellwether 10-year note  was off 3/32 in price and yielding 2.398 percent. German 10-year bund yields hovered near 1.0 percent, just above record lows hit at the end of last week, while yields on lower-rated bonds dipped. U.S. crude oil and Brent crude futures were down after giving up early gains as recovering Libyan output, sustained Iraqi production and weak demand offset concerns about threats to supply. Brent was at 14-month lows at $101.35, off 25 cents. U.S. crude was last at $95.89, down 52 cents. Investors were looking ahead to Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve releases minutes from the July 29-30 Fed policymaking meeting, as well as Fed Chair Janet Yellen’s speech at a gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming on Friday. “In the minutes, people will be looking for an exit strategy, but given data we have had, no one is expecting it to come sooner than previously expected. Fed futures are looking to September 2015 and expectations in the market come around that time frame, which is late 2015,” said Thomas Simons, money market economist at Jefferies LLC in New York.

Data on housing and inflation gave the market more support. Home Depot Inc gained 6 percent to $88.66, marking the stock’s largest percentage gain since May 2009 and giving the biggest boost to the Dow. The world’s largest home improvement retailer reported earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street’s expectations. Home Depot also raised its full-year profit forecast. The S&P; 500 retail index shot up 2 percent, its biggest gain since Feb. 6. The index is up nearly 6 percent for the month so far. Apple Inc returned to the triple-digit zone, hitting $100 for the first time since its seven-for-one stock split in June and giving the iPad and iPhone maker a market capitalization that topped $600 billion. The rally in Apple’s stock was the single biggest force lifting the S&P; 500 and the Nasdaq 100 index on Tuesday. At midday, Apple was up 1.3 percent at $100.49. “People have been looking to put a stake in the heart of retailers, due to a weak consumer and weak jobs market, relatively speaking, but they have been a ‘bend but don’t break’ group, which gives a comfort to those on the fence,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. Housing starts rebounded strongly in July as groundbreaking surged 15.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.09 million units to halt two straight months of declines and top expectations for a rate of 969,000 units. In addition, the Consumer Price Index edged up 0.1 percent last month, in line with expectations, which could give the Federal Reserve reason to keep interest rates low for a while. “All of these together are giving the market a good tone, shrugging off the recent dip related to geopolitical concerns,” Bakhos said. Minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July meeting will be released on Wednesday. Investors will also closely monitor the  annual meeting of top central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, from Thursday through Saturday for possible insight into the path for monetary policy. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 75.83 points or 0.45 percent, to 16,914.57. The S&P; 500 gained 8.54 points or 0.43 percent, to 1,980.28. The Nasdaq Composite  added 12.39 points or 0.27 percent, to 4,520.70. Shares of discount retailer TJX Cos Inc jumped 8.6 percent to $58.51 and the stock of teen-oriented chain Urban Outfitters Inc rose 4.1 percent to $38.43 - both after quarterly results. Dick’s Sporting Goods shares advanced 3.3 percent to $44.96 after the retailer’s second-quarter results topped analysts’ forecasts. The shares of youth-oriented retailer Aeropostale Inc  surged 22.8 percent to $3.98. Aeropostale said it had reappointed Julian Geiger as chief executive officer and forecast a smaller loss than its earlier view. In contrast to retailers’ overall strength for the day, shares of Elizabeth Arden Inc sank 24 percent to $14.91 after the company reported the biggest quarterly loss in its history due to a steeper-than-anticipated drop in sales of celebrity perfumes.

The dollar climbed smartly as the euro sank to a nine-month low against the dollar. U.S. Treasuries yields fell. Bolstered by strong profits from retailer Home Depot  and improved U.S. housing and economic data, Wall Street gained as  equities worldwide traded near multi-year highs despite the past month’s jitters over conflicts in Ukraine, Iraq and Gaza.

The MSCI All Country Index was up 0.35 percent at 427.89.

Home Depot gained 4.1 percent to $86.99 as the biggest boost to both the Dow and S&P; 500. The world’s largest home improvement retailer reported earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street expectations and raised its full-year profit forecast. “It’s been very mixed in the retail world and a company like Home Depot, there is a multiplier effect there,” said David Donabedian, chief investment officer at Atlantic Trust in Baltimore. “It is retail but it also feeds into the perception of what is happening in the housing market, which finally seems to have turned positive. That is huge for the economy.” Housing starts rebounded strongly in July, as groundbreaking surged 15.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual 1.09-million unit pace to halt two straight months of declines and top expectations for a 969,000-unit rate. In addition, the Consumer Price Index edged up 0.1 percent last month, in line with expectations, which could give the Federal Reserve reason to keep interest rates low for a while. “The Fed wants to see a pick-up in economic activity to raise their confidence that we are in a solid expansion, and the housing starts data certainly does that. At the same time, the very low inflation reading doesn’t give them any cause for panic on the inflation front,” said Donabedian. Minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July meeting will be released on Wednesday. Investors will also closely monitor the Aug. 21-23 annual meeting of top central bankers at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, for possible insight about the path for monetary policy. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 43 points or 0.26 percent, to 16,881.74, the S&P; 500 gained 4.78 points or 0.24 percent, to 1,976.52 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 10.53 points or 0.23 percent, to 4,518.84.

The minutes were from the two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in late July, when the Fed trimmed its monthly bond-buying program by an additional $10 billion. Stocks pared gains immediately after the release of the minutes, but the Dow and the S&P; 500 returned to positive territory with a little more than an hour of trading left in the regular session. The S&P; 500 barely missed its record close of 1,987.98 and finished within 5 points of its all-time intraday high of 1,991.39, both set on July 24. “The market was absolutely being driven by the Fed. It started out strongly, then it looked like a bit of capitulation before the statement came out, and then we obviously saw a big sigh of relief,” said Drew Wilson, an equity analyst at Fenimore Asset Management in Cobleskill, New York. With the minutes out, investors have turned their attention to the annual meeting of top central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, which will take place from Thursday through Saturday.  Fed Chair Janet Yellen is expected to acknowledge during the conference that while economic data has generally been supportive, she remains concerned about slack in the labor market. She is scheduled to speak on Friday. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 59.54 points, or 0.35 percent, to end at 16,979.13. The S&P; 500 gained 4.91 points, or 0.25 percent, to finish at 1,986.51. The Nasdaq Composite dipped 1.03 points, or 0.02 percent, to close at 4,526.48. After the bell, Hewlett-Packard Co shares fell 0.7 percent following the computing company’s results. Hewlett-Packard reported an increase in quarterly revenue, surprising analysts. During the regular session, Home Depot was the Dow’s biggest percentage gainer. Shares of the world’s largest home improvement retailer rose 2.9 percent to a record closing high of $90.75 a day after Home Depot’s earnings beat Wall Street’s expectations. The stock also set an all-time intraday high on Wednesday of $91.07. Lowe’s Cos Inc, a rival of Home Depot, rebounded. The stock gained 1.6 percent to close at $52.33 after setting an intraday record high of $52.65. At one point, Lowe’s stock fell as low as $49.71 after the home improvement products retailer reported better-than-expected quarterly results but cut its full-year forecast. The S&P; retail index ended up 1.1 percent, marking its fifth gain in six sessions despite tepid results from some major retailers. Shares of Target Corp rose 1.8 percent to $60.33, shaking off initial declines after the U.S. discount retailer’s second-quarter earnings fell shy of analysts’ estimates. The company cut its full-year outlook. American Eagle Outfitters was a bright spot in the retail sector after the teen-oriented chain’s second-quarter results beat expectations and forecasts for third-quarter earnings were in line with the current estimate. Its stock jumped 12 percent to $12.98. About 4.5 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, compared with the five-day average of 5.2 billion.

194,HD,UPDATE 3-Lowe's expects pickup in home improvement spending,"* Cuts sales growth forecast to 4.5 pct from 5 pct * 2nd-qtr revenue rises 5.6 pct to $16.59 bln * Expects spending on home-improvement to grow in second half   (Adds details from conference call, CEO interview; updates shares) By Sruthi Ramakrishnan Aug 20 (Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos Inc, the No. 2 U.S. home improvement products retailer, echoed larger rival Home Depot Inc in anticipating higher spending on renovations in the second half of the year as the U.S. housing market showed signs of a recovery. Lowe’s said it expects higher demand for products such as electronic appliances, fashion fixtures and flooring as people spruce up their homes ahead of the holidays. “Consumers are indicating stronger intentions to complete a home-improvement project, with most of them planning a specific project in the next three months,” Lowe’s Chief Executive Robert Niblock said on a conference call with analysts. Home Depot on Tuesday maintained its full-year sales growth forecast of about 4.8 percent, but said it expected same-store sales to grow faster in the second half as customers renovate homes with big-ticket purchases. U.S. housing starts rebounded strongly in July, Commerce Department data showed on Tuesday, signaling that the housing market is regaining its footing after being hurt by last year’s run-up in interest rates. Lowe’s, however, on Wednesday cut its sales growth forecast to about 4.5 percent from about 5 percent for the year ending January, unable to make up for the sales missed during the prolonged North American winter. “... First and second quarter together, we are still slightly short of where we’d anticipated being this time of the year,” Niblock told Reuters. Lowe’s also lowered its same-store sales growth forecast for the year by half a percentage point to about 3.5 percent. “It was quite evident after the first quarter that the guidance was hopelessly optimistic,” Rahul Sharma, managing director at Neev Capital, told Reuters. “They assumed too much acceleration.” Sharma said wage inflation among the more skilled job categories and the “general wealth effect” on those invested in equities and similar products were making the higher-income consumer a spending “sweet spot.” But lower and middle-income consumers are reining in spending on food and other essentials, forcing Wal-Mart Stores Inc and dollar stores to discount more. BETTER-THAN-EXPECTED SECOND QUARTER Lowe’s maintained its full-year profit forecast of about $2.63 per share. The company said it recovered “most of the outdoor product sales” it had missed due to a severe winter but said sales of discretionary interior products, such as window air conditioners, were fewer than expected in the second quarter due to a cooler summer. Lowe’s same-store sales rose 4.4 percent in the second quarter. Analysts polled by Consensus Metrix had expected a rise of 4.1 percent. Net income rose 10.5 percent to $1.04 billion, or $1.04 per share, in the quarter ended Aug. 1. Revenue rose 5.6 percent to $16.59 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.02 per share on revenue of $16.55 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Lowe’s shares were nearly flat at $51.70 on the New York Stock Exchange after falling as much as 3.5 percent in early trading.

196,HD,Home Depot names U.S. retail head Craig Menear as CEO,"(Reuters) - Home Depot Inc named retail industry veteran Craig Menear as its chief executive, four months after he was appointed as head of the home improvement chain’s U.S. retail business. Menear succeeds Frank Blake, who has led the company since 2007. Blake will stay on as chairman, the company said in a statement. Menear, 56, joined Home Depot in 1997 as a merchandising manager. He held various management positions before being named senior vice president of merchandising in 2003, according to the company’s website. The move comes as Home Depot tries to steer through a slow recovery in the U.S. housing market, where rising interest rates and low wage growth have stifled spending on new homes. The company, on Tuesday, maintained its full-year sales growth forecast but offered a positive outlook for the rest of the year. Home Depot said it expected same-store sales to grow faster in the second half of the year as homeowners spend more on repairing and remodeling their homes after a severe winter season. Menear’s move will be effective on Nov. 1, the company said. Before joining Home Depot, Menear worked at furniture companies Ikea [IKEA.UL], Builders Emporium, Grace Home Centers and Montgomery Ward. Blake, who led Home Depot through the financial recession, drove sales at the world’s largest home improvement retailer from $66 billion in 2010 to $78 billion in 2013 - levels last seen before the recession. The company’s stock more than doubled during his six years at the helm. Home Depot shares were little changed in extended trading after closing at $91.15 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.

198,HD,Home Depot says probing 'unusual activity' after data breach report,"(Reuters) - Home Depot Inc said on Tuesday it was working with law enforcement to investigate “some unusual activity” related to customer data but that it could not confirm if it had become the latest retailer to be hit by a large-scale security breach. Shares of the home improvement chain closed 2 percent lower at $91.15 on the news, which highlights growing scrutiny of data security in the retail industry following a massive breach at Target Corp last year. “At this point, I can confirm that we’re looking into some unusual activity and we are working with our banking partners and law enforcement to investigate,” Home Depot representative  Paula Drake wrote in an emailed statement to Reuters. “If we confirm that a breach has occurred, we will make sure customers are notified immediately.” The statement came after security website KrebsonSecurity first reported that multiple banks had seen evidence that Home Depot may be the source of stolen credit and debit cards put up for sale on underground markets. Brian Krebs, who runs the website, could not be immediately reached for comment. Krebs wrote on his website that his preliminary analysis indicated the problem could affect all of Home Depot’s 2,200 stores in the United States. He said several banks he contacted believed the breach could extend back to April or May of this year. “If that is accurate - and if even a majority of Home Depot stores were compromised - this breach could be many times larger than Target,” Krebs wrote. In the Target breach, which hit the retailer during the important year-end holiday shopping season, hackers stole at least 40 million payment card numbers and 70 million other pieces of customer data.  The incident cost the company hundreds of millions of dollars and prompted numerous investigations by attorneys general and congressional hearings and inquiries. In May, the company ousted its CEO, Gregg Steinhafel, who has now been replaced by former Wal-Mart Stores Inc executive Brian Cornell.  Numerous companies have come under the spotlight for potential breaches in recent months.  In some situations, companies that conduct investigations into data breaches may not be able to come to a definitive conclusion. For instance, Sears Holdings Corp said in February that an investigation into a possible data breach did not reveal conclusive information. Retailers have been taking steps to better protect customer data. Wal-Mart Stores Inc said last week that 4,600 of its group stores were now using payment terminals capable of reading credit and debit cards that store information on computer chips. Such cards are more secure than conventional ones that store data on magnetic stripes. The bulk of those stores activated the terminals this year, spokesman Randy Hargrove said. The retailer plans to activate terminals in its remaining U.S. stores by the end of 2014.

Brian Krebs, who runs the website, had said on Tuesday   that the problem could affect all of Home Depot’s 2,200 stores in the United States. On Wednesday, he said he found new evidence that the breach first surfaced on the website Rescator, where customer credit cards were listed according to store ZIP code. These codes showed a 99.4 percent overlap with Home Depot stores, he said. In all, there were 1,939 codes corresponding to Home Depot store locations, Krebs’ website said. It is not yet clear how many customers were impacted. Home Depot has not confirmed that a breach occurred. Company spokeswoman Paula Drake said the retailer is working with leading IT security firms, including Symantec Corp (SYMC.O) and FishNet Security, to investigate whether there has been a data breach. “Our forensics and security teams have been working around the clock since we first became aware of a potential breach Tuesday morning,” she said. The retailer sought to reassure customers on Wednesday that they will not be held responsible for any possible fraudulent charges. It also asked them to closely monitor their accounts and said it will offer free identity-protection services, including credit monitoring, to any customers who may have been affected. Home Depot could be the latest in a string of retailers to have been hit by security breaches in the recent past. If confirmed, the Home Depot breach could be among the worst.   U.S. retailers have been slow to adopt chip-reading technology on their terminals as most Americans do not carry chip-enabled cards. In one of the most serious incidents, hackers last year  stole at least 40 million payment card numbers and 70 million other pieces of customer data from Target Corp (TGT.N).  The largest-known breach at a U.S. retailer, however, was uncovered in 2007, at TJX Cos Inc (TJX.N), operator of the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains, where more than 90 million credit cards were stolen over about 18 months. In some situations, companies that conduct investigations into data breaches may not be able to come to a definitive conclusion. For instance, Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD.O) said in February that an investigation into a possible data breach did not reveal conclusive information. Home Depot shares fell 2.4 percent to close at $89.00 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

209,HD,"In wake of Target, Home Depot tight with info in breach response","(Reuters) - Home Depot Inc (HD.N) is being tight-lipped about its possible credit card breach, the opposite approach to the one Target Corp (TGT.N) took nearly a year ago. Almost a week after security blogger Brian Krebs warned that Home Depot could be the victim of a breach extending to more than 2,000 U.S. stores, the home improvement chain has not confirmed or denied that one had occurred. The company said Tuesday that it was working with authorities to investigate the matter. By contrast, Target made initial disclosures on its breach’s scope but later revised them in a series of updates that confused and angered consumers, hitting sales and contributing to Chief Executive Officer Gregg Steinhafel’s departure.  In its minimalist communication strategy, Home Depot likely is drawing lessons from Target, avoiding an incremental approach that risks giving the impression that it does not have a complete grasp of the problem, crisis management experts said. “When you have criminal behavior, you don’t know right away what all the ramifications are,” said Davia Temin, head of a consultancy focused on crisis and reputation management. “It’s really hard when you are trying to overcommunicate not to misstate reality.” Target in December used its first disclosure to say 40 million credit and debit cards might have been compromised. A week later it said encrypted PIN data had been stolen. And in January, it said data on up to 70 million people might have been taken. Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said the company had moved quickly to inform customers as facts were uncovered during a complex investigation.  To be sure, the situations facing Target and Home Depot are not exactly the same. While Target knew it was dealing with data theft, Home Depot has held on to the possibility that no breach has occurred.  “When you are in a situation like this you have a choice,” Home Depot CEO Frank Blake said at an investor conference on Thursday. “On the one hand, you can wait to communicate anything until you have the facts at hand, or you can communicate the facts as you know them. We chose the latter path.” Blake did not address Krebs’ reporting, including his estimate on the scope of the possible breach. Home Depot spokeswoman Paula Drake said on Monday that the company did not have any updates on the situation.    A spate of recent breaches has tested crisis communications across the retail sector. When such an incident happens, management must balance competing interests, from law enforcement, which typically pushes for sparse disclosure, to public relations officials, who want to say more. Jason Maloni, a crisis communications specialist at public relations firm Levick, said Home Depot had done the right thing by waiting until it knows more before estimating the parameters of the breach or disclosing other details.   “I think everyone has learned from Target,” he said.

211,HD,"U.S. states probe Home Depot breach, senators seek FTC investigation","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two senators asked the federal government to investigate a data breach on the payment-card processing systems of Home Depot Inc (HD.N) and five U.S. states launched a probe into the matter on Tuesday as fallout from last week’s attack intensified. The retailer has yet to say what was stolen, though experts fear the attackers may have gotten away with more than 40 million payment cards, which would exceed the number taken in last year’s unprecedented attack on Target Corp (TGT.N).  Home Depot said customers who shopped at its stores as far back as April were exposed, meaning the breach extended for more than four months including the busy summer season. That is far longer than the three-week Target breach. The increased government scrutiny could be another sign of trouble for Home Depot, even though it has yet to determine the full scope of the breach, analysts warned. “This sounds worrisome,” said Efraim Levy, senior equity analyst at Standard & Poor’s. The news also caught the attention of credit ratings agency Moody’s, which said the attack is a “negative” factor, though there was no immediate rating impact. The effort by five U.S. states was disclosed just a day after the largest U.S. home improvement retailer confirmed it had been breached.  A spokeswoman for Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen told Reuters that California, Connecticut and Illinois would lead the multistate effort. New York and Iowa said they would also participate. “We have had initial contact with the company,” said Jaclyn Falkowski, director of communications for Jepsen. Meanwhile, U.S. senators Edward Markey of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate. “If Home Depot failed to adequately protect customer information, it denied customers the protection that they rightly expect when a business collects such information,” the senators said in a statement. “Such conduct is potentially unfair and deceptive, and therefore could violate the FTC Act.” An FTC spokesman declined comment. The agency investigates breaches but tends to focus on cyberattacks that are partially the result of poor security on the part of the victim. Home Depot spokeswoman Paula Drake said in response to the possible FTC probe that the company will continue to cooperate with lawmakers and others. She declined to comment on the multistate investigation. The retailer said on its website that banks and law enforcement warned of unusual activity related to its payment systems on Sept. 2, prompting it to hire security experts who confirmed it had been breached. When asked if investigators had confirmed the attackers had been removed from the company’s network, Drake declined to comment.  The company has advised customers to examine statements carefully for unusual charges, saying they will not be held responsible for fraudulent activity. It has arranged for free credit monitoring.

212,HD,Home Depot sued by customer over data breach,"(Reuters) - Home improvement retailer Home Depot Inc (HD.N) has been sued over data breach by a customer, saying the company failed to properly safeguard customer data from hackers, a lawsuit filed in a Chicago federal court showed on Tuesday. The lawsuit comes a day after Home Depot confirmed that its payment security systems have been breached, potentially impacting its customers in stores across the United States and Canada.  Illinois resident Kelsey O’Brien filed the lawsuit, seeking class-action status, compensatory and punitive damages and credit card monitoring services for a period of three years. O’Brien said he used his credit card at two Home Depot stores on May 19 and June 2 and had his personal financial information exposed. Home Depot had failed to comply with reasonable security standards at the expense and to the severe detriment of its own customers, the lawsuit said. Several stolen card details were placed for sale on an underground website notorious for offering stolen card data and were being used to change the PIN numbers, it said. “We haven’t seen the suit yet and right now we are focused on our customers and the investigation, so it would be premature to comment,” Stephen Holmes, a Home Depot spokesman said. The retailer said there was no evidence that online customers were affected or debit personal identification numbers (PINs) were compromised, but experts fear the attack could rival Target Corp’s (TGT.N) massive breach last year. Home Depot said customers who shopped at its stores as far back as April were exposed, suggesting the breach extended through the busy summer season. The company, which had said earlier it would roll out PIN- and chip-enabled cards at all its U.S. stores, has promised free identity-protection services, including credit monitoring, to any potentially impacted customers. The breach was first reported by security website KrebsOnSecurity last Tuesday. Krebs said on Sunday that Home Depot’s systems were hit by a variant of the same malware that compromised Target’s systems last year.

Home Depot said customers who shopped at its stores as far back as April were exposed, meaning the breach extended for more than four months including the busy summer season. That is far longer than the three-week Target breach. The increased government scrutiny could be another sign of trouble for Home Depot, even though it has yet to determine the full scope of the breach, analysts warned. “This sounds worrisome,” said Efraim Levy, senior equity analyst at Standard & Poor’s. The news also caught the attention of credit ratings agency Moody’s, which said the attack is a “negative” factor, though there was no immediate rating impact. The effort by five U.S. states was disclosed just a day after the largest U.S. home improvement retailer confirmed it had been breached. A spokeswoman for Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen told Reuters that California, Connecticut and Illinois would lead the multistate effort. New York and Iowa said they would also participate. “We have had initial contact with the company,” said Jaclyn Falkowski, director of communications for Jepsen. Meanwhile, U.S. senators Edward Markey of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate. “If Home Depot failed to adequately protect customer information, it denied customers the protection that they rightly expect when a business collects such information,” the senators said in a statement. “Such conduct is potentially unfair and deceptive, and therefore could violate the FTC Act.” An FTC spokesman declined comment. The agency investigates breaches but tends to focus on cyberattacks that are partially the result of poor security on the part of the victim. Home Depot spokeswoman Paula Drake said in response to the possible FTC probe that the company will continue to cooperate with lawmakers and others. She declined to comment on the multistate investigation. The retailer said on its website that banks and law enforcement warned of unusual activity related to its payment systems on Sept. 2, prompting it to hire security experts who confirmed it had been breached. When asked if investigators had confirmed the attackers had been removed from the company’s network, Drake declined to comment. The company has advised customers to examine statements carefully for unusual charges, saying they will not be held responsible for fraudulent activity. It has arranged for free credit monitoring.

220,HD,RPT-UPDATE 2-Home Depot confirms security breach following Target data theft,"(Repeats with no changes to additional subscribers)  (Adds breach details, attorney comments, share price) By Nandita Bose CHICAGO, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc confirmed on Monday its payment security systems have been breached, a data theft analysts warn could rival Target Corp’s  massive breach last year. Home Depot said the data theft could impact its customers in stores across the United States and Canada, but there was no evidence that online customers were affected or debit personal identification numbers (PINs) were compromised. “We owe it to our customers to alert them that we now have enough evidence to confirm that a breach has indeed occurred,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Frank Blake said in a statement. “It is important to emphasize that no customers will be responsible for fraudulent charges to their accounts.” The breach was first reported by security website KrebsOnSecurity almost a week ago. It said the problem could extend back to April and affect all of Home Depot’s 2,200 stores in the United States. No details were immediately available on how many customers were impacted. But Brian Krebs, who runs the security website, said last week the breach could be larger than Target’s last year when hackers stole at least 40 million payment card numbers and 70 million other pieces of customer data. Krebs reported on Monday that Home Depot’s systems were hit by a variant of the same malware that compromised Target’s systems last year. Target has spent $146 million to resolve data breach-related issues since the fourth quarter of 2013. Most of these expenses were for settling actual and potential breach-related claims, mainly by payment card networks. The largest known breach at a U.S. retailer was uncovered in 2007 at TJX Cos Inc, operator of the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains, which had more than 90 million credit cards stolen over about 18 months. Home Depot said it started investigating the data breach last Tuesday, but the investigation will look at data from April. “It doesn’t exactly say a lot of good things about their data security systems if something was able to go on for months and they didn’t notice,” said Kenneth Dort, partner at intellectual property practice group, Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP. Home Depot promised free identity-protection services, including credit monitoring, to any potentially impacted customers. Home Depot had said earlier it will roll out PIN- and chip-enabled cards at all its U.S. stores by the end of the year. The retailer also said its internal information technology security team is working with banking partners, firms including Symantec Corp and Fishnet Security, as well as the U.S Secret Service to gather facts in the investigation, it said. Shares of Home Depot ended 0.86 percent lower at $90.82 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.

222,HD,Cyber breaches rare among U.S. state-registered investment advisers -study,"Sept 10 (Reuters) - Cyber security breaches are rare among investment advisory firms registered with U.S. states, but improvements to technology and procedures could still bolster protection of client information, state securities regulators said on Wednesday. Just 4 percent of advisers reported having a “cyber security incident” during the years in which they have been registered in their respective states, according to a study by the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA). The incidents were as diverse as website breaches and hackers impersonating clients via email. Theft and unauthorized use of confidential data were problems for 1 percent of advisers, NASAA said. The study did find problems, however. For example, nearly a third of advisers that contact clients via email do not send messages through a secure system that prevents them from being read by hackers and other third parties. Also, fewer than half of the firms surveyed, or 44 percent, had policies, procedures and training in place related to cyber security. State-registered investment advisers account for more than half of the registered investment advisers in the United States, NASAA said. The group released the cyber-security study on Wednesday at its annual conference in Indianapolis. Financial services firms have been jittery about information security after several high-profile data breaches at major retailers, including Target Corp and Home Depot Inc.  JPMorgan Chase & Co is also investigating a possible cyber attack, a spokeswoman said on Aug. 29. NASAA’s study included 440 state-registered investment advisory firms in nine states. U.S. state securities regulators oversee small and mid-sized investment advisers who manage up to $100 million. Larger investment advisers register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Other states are now using NASAA’s pilot study to collect information from advisers in their jurisdictions. NASAA plans to develop guidance for advisers about cyber security practices based on the results, Valerie Mirko, NASAA deputy general counsel, said in a telephone interview. NASAA expects the additional results by yearend, Mirko said.

223,HD,Home Depot sued by customer over data breach,"(Reuters) - Home improvement retailer Home Depot Inc (HD.N) has been sued over data breach by a customer, saying the company failed to properly safeguard customer data from hackers, a lawsuit filed in a Chicago federal court showed on Tuesday. The lawsuit comes a day after Home Depot confirmed that its payment security systems have been breached, potentially impacting its customers in stores across the United States and Canada.  Illinois resident Kelsey O’Brien filed the lawsuit, seeking class-action status, compensatory and punitive damages and credit card monitoring services for a period of three years. O’Brien said he used his credit card at two Home Depot stores on May 19 and June 2 and had his personal financial information exposed. Home Depot had failed to comply with reasonable security standards at the expense and to the severe detriment of its own customers, the lawsuit said. Several stolen card details were placed for sale on an underground website notorious for offering stolen card data and were being used to change the PIN numbers, it said. “We haven’t seen the suit yet and right now we are focused on our customers and the investigation, so it would be premature to comment,” Stephen Holmes, a Home Depot spokesman said. The retailer said there was no evidence that online customers were affected or debit personal identification numbers (PINs) were compromised, but experts fear the attack could rival Target Corp’s (TGT.N) massive breach last year. Home Depot said customers who shopped at its stores as far back as April were exposed, suggesting the breach extended through the busy summer season.

The breach was first reported by security website KrebsOnSecurity last Tuesday. Krebs said on Sunday that Home Depot’s systems were hit by a variant of the same malware that compromised Target’s systems last year.  Target’s data breach weeks before Christmas led to theft of about 40 million credit and debit card records and 70 million other records with customer details. Two senators asked the federal government to investigate the Home Depot breach and five U.S. states launched a probe into the matter on Tuesday as fallout from last week’s attack intensified.

225,HD,UPDATE 2-JPMorgan Chase replaces some credit cards after Home Depot breach,"(Adds detail on card security breaches, byline) By David Henry NEW YORK, Sept 17 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co is replacing some credit and debit cards following the security breach at Home Depot Inc, a company spokesman said. The company began sending notices on Tuesday to some card holders, advising them that they will soon receive new cards because the breach put them “at risk.” One of the notices said the company would mail a new card on Sept. 30. The existing card can be used in the meantime, but the notice advised monitoring the account for unrecognized purchases. JPMorgan spokesman Paul Hartwick could not immediately say how many cards are likely to be replaced. Home Depot disclosed on Sept. 8 that its payment security systems had been breached. The company is investigating how much account data might have been taken as customers paid for purchases in the United States and Canada from April through August. The spokesman could not immediately say why the bank moved now to replace the cards or discuss how it balanced the goals of thwarting fraud and minimizing inconvenience to customers. After card data was taken from Target Corp stores in December, JPMorgan quickly canceled some debit cards that were threatened and asked customers to go to branches for replacements. JPMorgan is the biggest U.S. bank by assets and one of the biggest card issuers. It issues cards under its Chase brand and under co-branding relationships with some airlines and hotel chains, such as United, Southwest and Marriott. The notice to card holders said customers will not be liable for unauthorized transactions that they report promptly to the company. The company said it would continue to monitor accounts to help identify unusual activity. After confirming the breach, Home Depot promised free identity-protection services, including credit monitoring, to any potentially affected customers.

228,HD,Home Depot breach bigger than Target at 56 million cards,"BOSTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc (HD.N) Thursday said some 56 million payment cards were likely compromised in a cyberattack at its stores, suggesting the hacking attack at the home improvement chain was larger than last year’s unprecedented breach at Target Corp (TGT.N).  Home Depot, in providing the first clues to how much the breach would cost, said that so far it has estimated costs of $62 million. But it indicated that costs could reach much higher. It will take months to determine the full scope of the fraud, which affected Home Depot stores in both the United States and Canada and ran from April to September. Retailer Target incurred costs of $148 million in its second fiscal quarter related to its breach. Target hackers stole at least 40 million payment card numbers and 70 million other pieces of customer data. Home Depot said that criminals used unique, custom-built software that had not been seen in previous attacks and was designed to evade detection in its most complete account of what had happened since it first disclosed the breach on Sept. 8.  The company said that the hackers’ method of entry has been closed off, the malware eliminated from its network, and that it had rolled out “enhanced encryption of payment data” to all U.S. stores. “We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience and anxiety this has caused and want to reassure them that they will not be liable for fraudulent charges,” Chief Executive Frank Blake said in a statement. Of the estimated cost so far of $62 million, which covers such items as credit monitoring, increased call center staffing, and legal and professional services, Home Depot said it believes that $27 million of the amount will be paid for by insurers. But the company said it has not yet estimated the impact of “probable losses” related to the possible need to reimburse banks for fraud and card replacement, as well as covering costs of lawsuits and government investigations. “Those costs may have a material adverse effect on The Home Depot’s financial results in the fourth quarter and/or future periods,” the company said in its statement.  Wesley McGrew, an expert of retail breaches who is an assistant research professor at the department of computer science at Mississippi State University, said that Home Depot is going to be expected to bear the costs related to fraud and payment card replacement.  Banks typically seek to get retailers to cover those costs if there are any indications of shortcomings in their security. Criminals have frequently used software that evades detection, but retailers are expected to closely monitor their networks using tools that are designed to uncover signs of a crime in progress, McGrew said.  “It’s hard to feel sorry for them when there are things they could have done to improve the security of these transactions,” McGrew said.  Hitesh Sheth, chief executive of Vectra Networks, a cybersecurity firm in San Jose, California, said Home Depot’s breach exposes a weakness, noting that the company said hackers used unique, custom-built malware. That “essentially means the technology they are using is only designed to detect malware that has already been used in a previous attack, and that is symptomatic of the retail industry,” Sheth said. “Retailers need to upgrade to technology that is available and detects behavior of malware that is new because these attacks are not going to stop anytime soon.” For its fiscal year ending in February, Home Depot revised its earnings estimate to $4.54 per share from $4.52. In addition to the cost related to the breach, it said the estimate includes a pre-tax gain of about $100 million on the sale of 3.6 million common shares of HD Supply stock. The company left its outlook for sales growth for the year at 4.8 percent.

236,HD,UPDATE 2-J.C. Penney names Home Depot executive to succeed CEO Ullman,"(Adds analyst comments and details, updates shares) Oct 13 (Reuters) - J.C. Penney Co Inc named Marvin Ellison, credited with resurrecting Home Depot Inc’s U.S. business, as its next chief executive as the department store operator looks to push on since stemming a two-year long sales decline. J.C. Penney’s shares rose as much as 5.3 percent to $7.50 in early trading as the company ended a year-long search for a replacement for interim CEO Myron Ullman. Ellison, who will take over as CEO on Aug. 1, 2015, held a variety of roles at Target Corp over 15 years before joining Home Depot Inc in 2002. The 49-year old has been heading the home improvement chain’s U.S. stores business since August 2008. “Ellison has a successful track record of simplifying store operations, improving customer service, and ... is widely known for being a great leader and motivator,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Wayne Hood wrote in a note. After two years of falling profits, Home Depot has posted an increase of at least 16 percent in earnings every year since 2010 - a feat that Belus Capital Advisors analyst Brian Sozzi said is down to Ellison and Home Depot’s CEO Frank Blake. Ullman, who was J.C. Penney’s CEO from 2004 to 2011, was brought back by J.C. Penney in April last year and succeeded in arresting a same-store sales declines that lasted nine quarters. Same-store sales has since increased for three straight quarters, but the company has reported a profit only once in the last 12 quarters. “While Mike Ullman has done a respectable job stabilizing JCP, it’s become readily apparent that a new vision is necessary to transform the company and fix its largest problem - deteriorating traffic,” Sterne Agee analysts wrote in a note. The 112-year-old retailer’s market share losses and slide in sales has been blamed on attempts by former CEO Ron Johnson, who was replaced by Ullman, to take the retailer upmarket. The company has been trying to win back shoppers by revamping its household goods section and bringing back many of the no-frills clothes ditched under Johnson. Still, J.C. Penney cut its third-quarter same-store sales forecast last week citing lower sales in September and a “difficult retail environment” and laid out plans to revamp the high traffic areas of its stores. The company said on Monday Ellison would join on Nov. 1 as president and CEO-designee. Ullman will remain with the company as executive chairman for one year after Ellison takes over as CEO. J.C. Penney said in August that Ullman was recovering from a surgery related to a medical condition he had for more than 20 years. The stock was up 4.5 percent at $7.44 in morning trading. Up to Friday’s close, it had lost 22 percent of their value this year.

238,HD,U.S. lawmaker seeks information from CEOs on cyber attacks,"WASHINGTON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - A senior Democratic lawmaker on Wednesday asked the chief executives of five companies, including Home Depot Inc, Target Corp and Kmart , to share more information about recent cyber attacks on their companies. U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said he was concerned about the rising number of cyber intrusions and media reports that they originate from overseas. “The increased frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks on both public and private entities highlights the need for greater collaboration to improve data security,” Cummings wrote in the letter, which was distributed to journalists. “Your company’s knowledge, information and experience with this recent data breach will be helpful as Congress examines federal cybersecurity laws and any necessary improvements to protect sensitive consumer and government financial information.” A Home Depot spokesman said the company will continue to cooperate with lawmakers and others. He declined to provide details. Cummings’ letter also went to Community Health Systems  and the parent company of US Investigations Services,  USIS, a firm that performs background checks on U.S. government employees. USIS was victim of a breach that compromised data of at least 25,000 workers, including some undercover investigators. Cyber attacks on retail outlets, such as Home Depot and Target, have affected tens of millions of American customers. Other widespread breaches include Michaels Stores Inc  and Neiman Marcus. Cummings sent a similar letter to the postmaster general on Monday after the U.S. Postal Service revealed it was the victim of a cyber attack that may have compromised the personal information of more than 800,000 employees, as well as data on customers who contacted its call center this year.

240,HD,"Home Depot sales exceed expectations, but profit misses","(Reuters) - Home Depot Inc (HD.N) on Tuesday reported slightly higher-than-expected quarterly sales as an improving job market encouraged home owners to increase spending on renovations, but earnings came in just below Wall Street estimates.

245,HD,Fitch Upgrades The Home Depot to 'A'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded its long-term Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) on The Home Depot, Inc. to 'A' from 'A-', and its  short-term IDR to 'F1' from 'F2'.  The Rating Outlook is Stable. Home Depot had  $16.7 billion of debt outstanding as of Nov. 2, 2014. A full rating list is  shown below.   Key Rating Drivers The upgrade reflects the strong improvement in Home Depot's comparable store  sales (comps), operating margins and free cash flow (FCF) over the past five  years, and Fitch's expectation that the company will be able to sustain this  performance going forward. Compared with its nearest competitor, Home Depot has  generated superior operating margins (400 basis-point gap) and consistently  stronger comps over the past five years. The ratings further consider Home Depot's leading position in the home  improvement retail sector in North America and steady adjusted debt/EBITDAR at  or under 2x. In addition, the ratings consider the cyclical nature of home  improvement retailing and the challenges posed by a slow economic recovery.  Home Depot is the world's largest home improvement retailer with a 25% market  share in the $312 billion U.S. home improvement market using the U.S. Census  Bureau's NAICS codes. Lowe's has a 17% share, and Menards has sizable presence  in the Midwest. Defining the market more broadly to include wholesalers, mass  merchants, and online sellers suggests that Home Depot and Lowe's have a  combined 20% of the market. Home Depot has been able to generate strong operating momentum in the midst of a  home improvement industry that has seen consumers focus on repair and  maintenance projects. Home Depot's comparable store sales (comps) have been positive since 2010.  Faster growth of seasonal and big ticket items helped to drive healthy 4.6% comp  growth in the first nine months of 2014. Comp sales are expected to grow at  3%-5% over the next two years, supported by a continued recovery in the housing  market and the company's investments in its multi-channel activities. Online  sales represented 4.4% of Home Depot's total sales in the third quarter of 2014,  but grew almost 40% in the quarter and the nine months, adding 1.7% to top-line  growth.   There has been no discernible impact on sales from Home Depot's September 2014  announcement of a data breach in which 56 million credit card numbers and 53  million emails were stolen. Fitch believes that the ultimate cash costs from  this breach to cover fraud reimbursement and credit card reissuance, among other  things, can be covered by FCF, although it would reduce the amount available for  share repurchases. Home Depot has produced a strong margin recovery on expense leverage, with EBIT  margins improving to 12.6% in the 12 months ending Nov. 2, 2014, from 11.9% in  2013 and 10.9% in 2012. The company targets a 13% operating margin and a 27%  ROIC by 2015 (from 11.9% and 20.9%, respectively, in 2013). Fitch believes this  is achievable, and sees moderate margin upside longer-term from fixed expense  leverage and the investments the company is making in technology and its supply  chain.  Home Depot is maintaining a very slow pace of new-store expansion, with plans to  build only six new stores in 2014, focused primarily in Mexico. Low levels of  capital expenditures (less than 2% of sales) have resulted in strong FCF after  dividends, which is expected to track around $4 billion annually going forward.  Fitch expects Home Depot would remain FCF positive in an economic downturn, as  it did through the last recession.  Financial leverage (adjusted debt/EBITDAR) was 1.8x as of November 2014, in-line  with year-end 2013. Fitch expects FCF and some incremental borrowings to be  directed to share repurchases, as the company manages its financial leverage at  or under 2x. Home Depot has a solid liquidity position supported by a cash balance of $2.2  billion at Nov. 2, 2014, together with an undrawn $2 billion credit facility.  The company also benefits from owning 90% of its stores.

246,HD,Obama seeks enhanced cybersecurity laws to fight hackers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Tuesday renewed a push to beef up U.S. cybersecurity laws after recent headline-grabbing hacking attacks against companies like Sony Pictures (6758.T), Home Depot (HD.N) and Target (TGT.N). During a tour of a “war room” at the Department of Homeland Security’s cybersecurity nerve center, Obama said the recent attacks have highlighted the threat faced by financial systems, power grids and healthcare systems that run on networks connected to the Internet. “We’ve got to stay ahead of those who would do us harm. The problem is that government and the private sector are still not always working as closely together as we should,” Obama said. Congress has tried and failed for years to pass legislation to encourage companies to share data from attacks with the government, and each other, but grappled with liability issues raised by companies and privacy concerns from civil liberties groups. But Obama proposed legislation, due to be sent to Congress on Tuesday, that seeks a balance. It would offer liability protection to companies that provide information in near-real-time to the government, but require them to strip it of any personal data. Obama has elevated cybersecurity to the top of his 2015 agenda, seeing it as an area where cooperation is possible with the Republican-led Congress.  He discussed the legislation on Tuesday with House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and said they agreed cybersecurity needs to be addressed.  The White House will also build momentum for the legislative move at a cybersecurity summit slated for Feb. 13 in Silicon Valley, at Stanford University. “Foreign governments, criminals and hackers probe America’s computer networks every single day. We saw that again in the attack on Sony,” Obama said. Obama has blamed the Sony hack on North Korea. A top Treasury Department sanctions official told lawmakers at a hearing on Tuesday the agency was looking at more ways to cut the country off from international financial systems. On Monday, people claiming to be allied with Islamic State militants hacked social media accounts for the U.S. military command that oversees operations in the Middle East. The attack is still under investigation but did not seem to have affected classified information, Obama said. U.S. cyber officials and companies have for years urged Congress to codify how they can best exchange information to respond to hacking attacks. Obama proposed legislation in 2011 that fizzled in Congress. His revised plan seeks to address corporate concerns that companies get immunity against government and private lawsuits based on cyber threat-related data shared with federal authorities. Privacy advocates applauded the proposal to require companies to strip private information from the data they share, and cautiously welcomed a call for new privacy rules that will determine how federal agencies are allowed to use and store the data. “It is a thoughtful proposal but ... there are still many gaps that need to be filled,” said Harley Geiger, senior counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology. Privacy advocates remain concerned about the access that intelligence agencies may have to the information companies share with the Department of Homeland Security, following last year’s disclosures about the scope of U.S. surveillance programs by former contractor Edward Snowden.  Obama also proposed to give law enforcement agencies broader power to investigate and prosecute cybercrime, hoping to deter the sale of spyware and theft of personal data.  His proposal would make selling stolen credit card information overseas a crime and would allow authorities to prosecute the sale of botnets, computer networks linked to cybercrime. He also wants to require companies to tell consumers within 30 days from the discovery of a data breach that their personal information has been compromised.

248,HD,UPDATE 3-Obama seeks enhanced cybersecurity laws to fight hackers,"(Adds legislation moving to Capitol Hill) By Roberta Rampton and Alina Selyukh WASHINGTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama sent a bill to Congress on Tuesday to strengthen U.S. cybersecurity laws to protect government, businesses and consumers while protecting privacy, after recent hacking attacks against Sony Pictures, Home Depot Inc and Target Corp , and on Monday the federal government itself. “We’ve got to stay ahead of those who would do us harm. The problem is that government and the private sector are still not always working as closely together as we should,” Obama said. During a tour of a “war room” at the Department of Homeland Security’s cybersecurity nerve center, Obama said the attacks highlighted the threat to financial systems, power grids and healthcare systems that run on networks connected to the Internet.

Liability issues raised by companies and privacy concerns of civil liberties groups contributed to the failure to implement such laws. Obama’s proposed legislation looks to balance needs with concerns by offering liability protection to companies that provide information in near-real-time to the government, while requiring them to strip it of any personal data. On Monday, the Twitter and YouTube accounts of the U.S. military command that oversees operations in the Middle East were hacked by people claiming to be sympathetic toward the Islamic State militant group being targeted in American bombing raids. Obama said the attack, which is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, did not seem to affect  classified information. Obama has moved cybersecurity to the top of his 2015 agenda, seeing it as an area where cooperation is possible with the Republican-led Congress. He discussed the legislation on Tuesday with House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and said they agreed cybersecurity needed to be addressed. Reaction from other congressional leaders was also positive. The leading Republicans and Democrats on the Senate and House Homeland Security committees said in a joint statement that Obama’s proposal would be useful. The White House will also try to build support for the legislation at a cybersecurity summit scheduled for Feb. 13 at Stanford University. Obama proposed legislation in 2011 that died in Congress. “Foreign governments, criminals and hackers probe America’s computer networks every single day.

249,HD,Pickup in U.S. home investment pushes broader housing rebound,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Results from Home Depot Inc (HD.N) and Toll Brothers Inc (TOL.N) bode well for a continued recovery in the housing market this year, thanks largely to an improving jobs market and low gasoline prices, industry officials and analysts said.  On Tuesday, the world’s largest home-improvement chain, Home Depot, posted its strongest-ever fourth quarter in terms of sales growth, driven by demand for home renovations. Luxury home builder Toll Brothers also lifted its full-year home delivery forecast. Shares of both companies rose nearly 4 percent. The pickup in home renovations, reflected by demand for paint, flooring and appliances, can be explained in part by the improved financial position of many households over the past three months due to lower gasoline prices, said Neil Saunders, chief executive of retail research firm Conlumino. The improved picture for many U.S. households is supported by data that measures consumer spending on new homes and home improvement, he said. Private residential fixed investment topped $577 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, the highest amount since the fourth quarter of 2007 when it stood at $616.4 billion. This comes even though total homes sold decreased in 2014,  Saunders said. He cautioned, however, that the sudden spurt in renovations could be short-lived if gasoline prices continue to inch up. Prices have risen every day for the past 28 days to an average of $2.30 for a gallon, up from a low of $2.03 last month. U.S. home prices also rose in December and experts said sales and prices of existing homes remained close to normal but construction of new home sales remain weak. But analysts said overall housing demand would continue to show an uptick, helped by growth in the number of jobs, higher wages and the recent federal initiatives to increase mortgage availability. For example, Toll Brothers is finding it easier to raise prices of its homes now and said there are more buyers in its key markets including Arizona, Colorado, Nevada and Washington. Another sign is the monthly principal and interest payments for single-family homes as a percentage of disposable income. It stood at 23 percent in December, much lower than the average of 35 percent since 1990, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Wetenhall. Wetenhall expects wage inflation in the second half of 2015 to more than offset higher interest rates and a low single-digit price appreciation in home prices. This he said adds to both affordability and the broader outlook for housing demand this year.

261,HD,Amazon.com expands into professional services with home marketplace,"CHICAGO, March 30 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is launching a home services marketplace that will connect customers with electricians, plumbers and painters in a move to have its services tied to every product sold on its website. Amazon Home Services, which will launch on Monday, will allow customers to buy 700 services such as car maintenance, TV wall-mounting and house cleaning at upfront prices. The quality of the service will be backed with an Amazon guarantee, which the retailer uses to vouch for products sold by third-party sellers on its website. A home services marketplace will extend Amazon’s role as a middleman for third-party vendors, which account for about 40 percent of its sales. It would also help Amazon gain an edge in the fast-growing services industry in the U.S. which the retailer estimates to be around $630 billion. “Third party estimates show that customers spend four times more on services each year than they do on physical products,” Peter Faricy, vice-president, Amazon Marketplace told Reuters. “So for us the opportunity is very big,” he said. Around 85 million Amazon shoppers buy products that require servicing or installation, the company said. Amazon will roll out the service nationwide with “high coverage” in Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York. Services marks a new frontier for Amazon, which has focused on selling products as it expanded from books into consumer goods, groceries and media. Local services have been tough for marketplace companies to turn a profit, since offerings must be tailored to each city or region. Amazon will be in direct competition with Angie’s List Inc , Craigslist Inc, and Yelp Inc as well as U.S. home improvement chains like Home Depot Inc and Lowe’s Companies Inc, which have invested in ways to link customers with local plumbers, painters and other service providers. Amazon will hand pick service professionals after running background checks and offer to match prices if customers get a lower price for the same service and professional on another site, store or directly from the professional within 30 days of a purchase, Faricy said. Amazon Home Services will have a revenue share model with the service providers. The retailer will charge a 5 percent transaction fee, along with platform fees ranging from 10 percent for custom services and 15 percent for standardized services.

262,HD,Home Depot profit beats amid U.S. housing recovery,"(Reuters) - Home Depot Inc (HD.N) reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit and sales on Tuesday and raised its full-year forecast as North American customers spent more on home repairs after a harsh winter.   The world’s No. 1 home improvement chain said strong housing contrasted with below-consensus U.S. GDP growth in the first quarter.  “The growth that we see in our business ... supports the view of the continued recovery in the U.S. housing market,” Chief Executive Craig Menear said on a conference call. Recent government data has led to optimism the housing market is picking up. U.S. housing starts rose 20 percent in April to their highest level since November 2007. Reports on existing home sales and mortgage applications have also pointed to strength in the sector. [US:nL1N0YA0KO] Home Depot said improved spending among wealthier Americans aided sales. About half of its shoppers live in homes valued above $200,000, which helped drive demand for big-ticket items like appliances.  Stores across the United States catered to customers making home improvements after digging out from a long winter. Departments that outperformed included tools, decor, lighting, plumbing and appliances. Net income rose to $1.58 billion, or $1.21 per share, from $1.38 billion, or $1.00 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $1.16 per share, 1 cent ahead of Wall Street estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.     Revenue rose 6 percent to $20.89 billion, also topping forecasts. Shares of the Dow industrials component were down 0.7 percent at $113.52. Up to Monday’s close, the stock had risen nearly 9 percent this year, outperforming rival Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N), which reports results on Wednesday.   Atlanta-based Home Depot raised its profit forecast for the year ending in February 2016 to between $5.24 and $5.27 per share including items, from $5.11 to $5.17.

Lowe’s missed earnings estimates during the first quarter, which is typically driven by promotions for home retailers, sending its shares down over 5 percent on Wednesday. A day earlier Home Depot topped expectations. Lowe’s comparable sales underperformed that of Home Depot in two out of the three months in the first quarter. The second-largest home improvement chain had lower exposure to the Northeastern states, which were battered by winter storms and blizzards leading to widespread economic damage. Home Depot capitalized on the storms and the winter months with better-timed promotions and saw its sales and profit beat expectations as customers spent more on home repairs after a harsh winter.   The two companies dominate the home improvement market and are seen as leading indicators for the health and revival of the U.S housing market. “Home Depot did a pretty good job in offering quick promotions to stimulate people into buying during the winter months whereas Lowe’s clearly lost momentum there,” said Neil Saunders, chief executive at research firm Conlumino. Explaining why Lowe’s sales were held back during the quarter, Lowe’s Chief Executive Robert Niblock told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday that some of the company’s spring promotions in stores were offered later than usual. In the face of the cold weather, it waited until the second quarter to launch promotions generally seen in the first. “We felt that would give better returns on investment in advertising and marketing,” Niblock said. He said Lowe’s is off to a strong start in seasonal category sales in the second quarter and will be able to achieve its full-year profit and sales outlook. During the quarter, Lowe’s outperformed in home appliances, but saw muted sales in key spring categories like lawn and garden.

Shares of the Dow component rose 3.3 percent to a record $123.60 in morning trading. The stock has far outperformed the broader market this year with a 17-percent gain. “The pace of growth was always bound to moderate as we came out of the exceptionally bad winter ... That the momentum has not slowed further is down to both a more confident consumer and greater activity in the housing market,” said Stephen Ward, director at retail research firm Conlumino. Sales of appliances, tools, plumbing materials and lighting products were strong in the quarter, Home Depot said. Despite moderate 2015 U.S. GDP projections, housing data pointed to continued growth in the home-improvement industry,  Chief Executive Craig Menear said on a conference call. U.S. housing starts rose to a near eight-year high in July as builders ramped up construction of single-family homes, suggesting the economy was firing on almost all cylinders. That followed Monday’s strong homebuilder sentiment data. “Home Depot and the home-remodeling space remains one of the strong areas of U.S. consumer spending,” said Peter Keith, senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray in New York. Net income rose to $2.23 billion, or $1.73 per share, in the quarter ended Aug. 2. Excluding items, the company earned $1.71 per share, in-line with the average analyst estimate. Home Depot incurred $153 million in gross expenses in the quarter for a data breach last year when hackers stole about 56 million payment cards. Net sales rose 4.3 percent to $24.83 billion, beating analysts’ estimate of $24.69 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Same-store sales rose 4.2 percent, also ahead of estimates, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. U.S. same-store sales rose at a faster clip. Home Depot raised its profit forecast for the year ending in  January to a range of $5.31 to $5.36 per share, from its earlier estimate of $5.24 to $5.27 per share. The forecast reflects this year’s estimated $7.0 billion in share buybacks. The company said it now expected sales to grow 5.2 percent to 6.0 percent, above its earlier 4.2 percent to 4.8 percent range, partly due to last month’s $1.63 billion acquisition of supplier Interline Brands. Smaller rival Lowe’s Cos Inc is scheduled to report results on Wednesday.

Home Depot rose as much as 3.4 percent to a record high of $123.80 after the home improvement retailer’s quarterly same-store sales increased more than expected. The stock gave the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P; 500 and, along with TJX, led the consumer discretionary index to its fourth straight day of gains. Home improvement companies and home builders are enjoying a spot in the sun from strong results and economic data. Data on Tuesday showed U.S. housing starts rose to a near eight-year high in July. This followed a Monday report showing homebuilder sentiment in August rose to a near decade-high. Housing stocks such as D.R. Horton, Toll Brothers , Lennar, PulteGroup and KB Home  all rose between 1 and 3 percent following the data. “The good data on housing is certainly helpful since its 4 percent of the U.S. GDP,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. “It’s something we know the Fed looks at relative to not only its impact on employment and things residual to the housing market but as well as to the wealth effect of homeowners.” At 10:59 a.m. ET (1459 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  was down 9.92 points, or 0.06 percent, at 17,535.26. The biggest drag on the index was Wal-Mart, which fell as much as 3.3 percent to a nearly 2-1/2 year low of $69.55 after its weak results. The S&P; 500 was up 0.42 points, or 0.02 percent, at 2,102.86 and the Nasdaq composite was down 8.18 points, or 0.16 percent, at 5,083.52. Even on the tech-heavy Nasdaq, the gains in consumer stocks such as Amazon.com, up 0.7 percent, on the index, helped lessen the impact of a slump in technology stocks. Seven of the 10 major S&P; sectors were lower, with the energy index’s 0.48 percent fall leading the decliners. U.S. oil prices and industrial metals, including copper, traded near six-year lows, amid worries over China’s outlook. Chinese stocks plunged again, reigniting fears that Beijing may be intent on a deeper devaluation of the yuan. A near 2 percent devaluation last week triggered an avalanche of selling by investors across the world who feared Beijing wanted to engineer a much sharper decline to support weak exports. “The problem in China is that the markets haven’t been released for free and open trading and until that happens there is going to continue to be downside pressure,” said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.

Wal-Mart shares fell as much as 3.2 percent to a nearly 2-1/2 year low of $69.58 and were the biggest drag on the Dow Jones industrial average. Disney fell 1.1 percent to $107.86 after a Wells Fargo downgrade and weighed on the S&P; 500 and the Dow. Apple , for whom China is a key market, fell 0.5 percent to 116.60 and was the biggest drag on the Nasdaq and the S&P; 500. Chinese stocks plunged again as the yuan weakened against the dollar, reigniting fears that Beijing may be intent on a deeper devaluation of the currency despite the central bank’s reassurances. The People’s Bank of China devalued the currency last week by nearly 2 percent, triggering an avalanche of selling by investors across the world who feared Beijing wanted to engineer a much sharper decline to support weak exports. “The problem in China is that the markets haven’t been released for free and open trading and until that happens there is going to continue to be downside pressure,” said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.

This follow a Monday report showing U.S. homebuilder sentiment in August rose to a near decade-high. Economic data points are being carefully evaluated by investors to gauge when the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. Although the U.S. economy appears to be stabilizing, the effect of the yuan devaluation and other macro factors are playing on investor’s minds. Investors are still not fully convinced the Fed will raise rates in September, but most are betting a rate hike will occur by the end of year. With the earning season winding down, all eyes are on the Wednesday minutes of the Fed’s latest meeting. Among retailers, TJX Cos, jumped 6.7 percent to a lifetime high of $76.43 after it reported higher quarterly sales.

The company’s same-store sales rose 4.3 percent in the second quarter, beating the average analyst estimate of 3.9 percent, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. Larger rival Home Depot Inc also reported a stronger-than-expected rise in quarterly same-store sales on Tuesday, helped by increased home remodeling activity and a recovery in the housing market. “Economists are forecasting a modest acceleration in both incomes and consumer spending this year and recovery in the housing market continues,” Lowe’s Chief Executive Robert Niblock said on a conference call on Wednesday. U.S. homebuilder sentiment rose in August to its highest level in almost a decade, the National Association of Home Builders said on Monday. Lowe’s sells items such as refrigerators, dishwashers and washing machines in its kitchens and appliances category, its biggest by sales. Its outdoor power equipment category includes chainsaws, branch trimmers and generators. The company offered more promotions on appliances to beat fierce competition. This hurt its gross margins to some extent, Chief Operating Officer Rick Damron said. Demand was low for exterior improvement items such as paint due to heavy rain in parts of the United States, Lowe’s said. Lowe’s net sales rose 4.5 percent to $17.35 billion in the quarter ended July 31, beating the average analyst estimate of $17.27 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income rose 8.7 percent to $1.13 billion, or $1.20 per share, but missed analysts’ expectation of $1.24 per share, mainly due to a higher tax rate and a rise in selling and general expenses. Unlike Home Depot, which raised its full-year profit and sales forecasts, Lowe’s maintained its forecast of a profit of about $3.29 per share, sales growth of 4.5-5.0 percent and same-store sales growth of 4.0-4.5 percent for the year ending January. Lowe’s shares were up slightly at $73.16 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Up to Tuesday’s close, the stock had risen about 45 percent in the past 12 months.

281,HD,Home Depot third-quarter sales beat amid U.S. housing recovery,"(Reuters) - Home Depot Inc (HD.N) on Tuesday reported a better-than-expected rise in quarterly sales at stores open at least a year and said full-year profit and same-store sales would be at the top end of its forecast. Shares of the world’s biggest home improvement retailer rose 3.4 percent to $125.07. “Consensus U.S GDP growth projections have moderated (in 2015) but we continue to see positive signs in the housing data with home price appreciation and housing turnover being key drivers of growth for our business,” Chief Executive Officer Craig Menear said on an earnings conference call. The U.S. housing recovery has been gaining traction, with homebuilder sentiment hitting decade highs in July, August and September, according to the National Association of Home Builders.  Builders’ confidence rose to a near 10-year high in October, according to a survey released last month.  All of Home Depot’s merchandising departments, including appliances, tools and plumbing, posted comparable-sales growth from a year ago. Categories like outdoor garden, electrical, millwork and lumber grew but were below the company average. Same-store sales rose 5.1 percent in the third quarter ended Nov. 1, above the 4.6 percent rate expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix. Comparable sales at its U.S. stores were up 7.3 percent, comfortably ahead of analysts’ average estimate of 5.9 percent, helped by strong demand from retail customers as well as professional contractors and builders.   Menear said the retailer posted growth in the size per transaction in the third quarter, with transactions over $900 rising nearly 8 percent from a year ago. The company expects overall same-store sales to increase 4.9 percent in the year ending January. Online sales rose approximately 25 percent and represented about 5.1 percent of overall sales. About 42 percent of all online orders were picked up in stores, Menear said. Quarterly net income jumped 12.2 percent to $1.73 billion, or $1.35 per share, from the same period a year ago.

The S&P; energy sector was down 1.23 percent - easily the worst performer of the 10 major S&P; sectors - as crude prices slipped on concerns of a supply glut. Exxon and Chevron were down about 1 percent. Wal-Mart, up 2.7 percent at $59.39, and Home Depot , up 2.8 percent at $124.08, provided the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P.; Strong results from the two big-box retailers lifted others in the sector, with Lowe’s up 3 percent, Ross Stores  2.3 percent and Target 2 percent. TJX was up 5.6 percent at $69.33 after reporting strong results. Data showed U.S. consumer prices rose 0.2 percent in October, in line with expectations, a sign that the drag on inflation from a strong dollar and lower oil prices was starting to ease. The modest rise in inflation could bolster chances of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates next month. Retail stocks were hammered last week after weak economic data and earnings from retailers such as Macy’s rekindled concerns about slowing retail spending ahead of the crucial holiday shopping season. “People understand that the U.S. consumer is okay, but not great,” said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG. “What we’re seeing with the consumer is that there’s a limited wallet. If you see increased spending one place, you see decreased spending in another place.” At 9:42 a.m. ET the Dow Jones industrial average was down 11.25 points, or 0.06 percent, at 17,471.76, the S&P; 500  was down 1.86 points, or 0.09 percent, at 2,051.33 and the Nasdaq Composite index was down 5.62 points, or 0.11 percent, at 4,979.00. Six of the 10 major S&P; sectors were higher, with the consumer discretionary sector’s 0.6 percent rise leading the advancers. U.S. stocks had their best day in three weeks on Monday, helped by strong gains in energy stocks as investors saw limited economic impact from the deadly attacks in Paris. Urban Outfitters dropped 12.7 percent to $19.87 and Dick’s Sporting Goods 15.4 percent to $34.51 after the retailers reported disappointing results. U.S. industrial output fell 0.2 percent in October, compared with the 0.1 percent increase expected, raising concerns for the robustness of fourth-quarter economic growth. Federal Reserve board governors Jerome Powell and Daniel Tarullo are slated to speak at separate events later in the day. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,629 to 1,038.

287,HD,Home Depot executive defends Electrolux deal for GE in U.S. court,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AB Electrolux’s deal to buy General Electric Co’s appliance business will tie together two companies facing stiff competition from Asian competitors and be good for consumers, Home Depot Inc  executive Bob Baird testified in U.S. federal court on Wednesday. The Justice Department is asking a judge to stop Sweden’s Electrolux, which makes Frigidaire, Kenmore and Tappan appliances, from buying GE’s appliance business for $3.3 billion. The department argues it would push prices up by 5 percent. The Justice Department questioned Baird’s credibility, saying he had a close relationship with Electrolux and General Electric, including a potential job offer from Electrolux. Baird has worked for Home Depot for 15 years. Asked if the deal would mean higher prices, Baird said, “I don’t think that’s true.” Ethan Glass, who argued for the government, highlighted a series of emails in which the Home Depot executive either advocated higher prices to appliance makers or unilaterally increased them. In one exchange, an Electrolux executive protested a higher price on a refrigerator, $998 in this case, and Baird responded, “I think $898 is too cheap. But thanks for asking.” Glass also pressed Baird on an email from August 2014, when he told a GE executive that “tomorrow should be a good day for our stock.” The following day, Home Depot announced better-than-expected earnings and the share price surged, Glass said. Baird responded that the note was sent after the market closed. “There is after-hours trading,” Glass said. The department has asked Judge Emmet Sullivan for an injunction to stop the deal. Two weeks ago, Electrolux CEO Keith McLoughlin testified that the deal would help his company negotiate more effectively with big input suppliers like steelmakers. He denied it would give his company increased pricing power. The Justice Department’s case focuses on lower-end kitchen appliances, the type that home builders put in new houses and apartments or less affluent consumers buy at big box stores. Electrolux, GE and Whirlpool make 90 percent of the stoves and ovens sold to big builders and property managers, it said.

291,HD,"Home Depot sales beat on housing recovery, outdoor demand","(Reuters) - Home Depot Inc (HD.N), the world’s largest home improvement chain, reported better-than-expected sales, boosted by an improving housing market and mild weather in the holiday quarter that encouraged customers continue outdoor activities and home renovations. Shares of the company, which also raised its quarterly dividend by 17 percent and announced a $5 billion share buyback plan, rose as much as 3.5 percent in morning trading on Tuesday. Home Depot is benefiting from a pent-up demand for houses after the 2008 financial recession. Low interest rates and growth in jobs, wage and credit are also spurring customers to spend more on renovating homes.      Warmer-than-average weather during the holidays also helped Home Depot drive sales across a number of outdoor categories as activities such as gardening carried on for much longer, Conlumino analyst Carter Harrison said.  Favorable weather trends in the quarter helped sales growth by about $100 million, Ted Decker, executive vice president of Merchandising, said on a conference call. Net sales rose 9.5 percent to $20.98 billion in the fourth quarter.   Sales at stores open for more than a year rose 8.9 percent in the United States in the quarter ended Jan. 31. Analysts on average expected sales to rise 5.3 percent, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. The results bucked a broader retail trend of disappointing holiday quarter sales as shoppers spent more on big-ticket items such as home improvement and automobiles, instead of discretionary items such as apparel. Sales of items priced above $900 rose 11.9 percent in the quarter, while those below $50 rose 3.8 percent, Decker said.  The appliances, tools and building material businesses posted double-digit comparable sales, while those for outdoor garden, paint, kitchen and bath were in mid-single digits, he added.  “Home Depot remains a beacon of strength in an increasingly bumpy macro and retail backdrop,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note, raising their price target by $10 to $145.   Home Depot’s strong performance has set a high bar for rival Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N), which reports results on Wednesday.  Home Depot said it expected 2016 sales to grow by 5.1-6.0 percent, which translates to $93.03-$93.83 billion. Analysts on average were expecting $93.12 billion. Comparable sales are expected to grow 3.7-4.5 percent, the company said.   Net earnings rose 6.6 percent to $1.47 billion, or $1.17 per share, in the fourth quarter, above analysts’ average estimate.

294,HD,"Fitch Affirms The Home Depot, Inc.'s IDR at 'A'; Outlook Stable","(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, February 25 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'A' long-term  Issuer Default Rating (IDR) for The Home Depot, Inc. (Home Depot). The Rating  Outlook is Stable. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating reflects Home Depot's strong track record of comparable store sales  (comps) growth, margin expansion and cash flow generation. Fitch expects the  company to maintain leverage (adjusted debt/EBITDAR) in line with its publicly  stated commitment of at or modestly below 2.0x over the forecast horizon. With $89 billion in 2015 sales, Home Depot holds the leading position in the  U.S. home improvement industry, which is amidst a recovery from the prior  housing recession. Fitch's rating anticipates a continued recovery as well as a  benign competitive environment. However, Fitch believes that should the housing  recovery stall, Home Depot has the willingness and ability to use its cash flow  generation to maintain its leverage commitments. Solid Track Record Home Depot has grown comps and EBITDA margin every year since 2010, with 5%  average annual comps and EBITDA improvement of over 500bps from 2009 to 15.8% in  2015. Operating momentum has been supported by improvement in home improvement  industry fundamentals, especially regarding repair and maintenance projects.  Home improvement retailers have further benefited from benign industry square  footage growth (including very modest unit expansion from Home Depot and chief  competitor Lowes) and competitive resilience to the discount and online  channels.  Success in the home improvement industry requires significant investments in  inventory breadth and customer service, and discounters generally focus on  categories with narrow assortment needs and limited customer service. Online  competition, meanwhile, has been limited due to short purchase windows and the  bulky/heavy nature of home improvement inventory (note that nearly half of Home  Depot's existing online sales involve in-store merchandise pickup). Continued Growth Expected Fitch anticipates continued sales and EBITDA growth over the forecast horizon,  predicated on a continued U.S. housing market recovery and Home Depot's focus on  its strategic pillars of customer service, product leadership, and  interconnected retail. The company's growth initiatives are designed to leverage  Home Depot's existing scale to broaden its customer base and share of wallet.  For example, the recent acquisition of Interline Brands gives Home Depot access  to the underpenetrated residential facility maintenance and repair market.  Meanwhile, Home Depot is using its online infrastructure to expand product  assortment and offer customers increased product knowledge, while promoting its  in-store pickup capability. Fitch believes successful execution of its initiatives, coupled with industry  tailwinds, will allow Home Depot to generate 2-4% annual comps and revenue  growth. EBITDA margins are expected to remain around 16% though Home Depot could  leverage fixed expenses at the high end of its comps range. Modest annual EBITDA  growth is projected to yield annual free cash flow (FCF) of $4.0 - $4.5 billion  after dividends of approximately $3.5 - $4.0 billion. Disciplined Capital Allocation Home Depot's scale and stable growth has allowed it to comfortably manage to its  adjusted leverage target of at or below 2.0x for several years (1.9x at year-end  2015). Fitch expects management to continue to balance its leverage target  against its goal to return cash to shareholders, with incremental debt issuance  expected to support share purchases. Given Home Depot's leverage commitment,  Fitch believes management could pull back on share repurchase to maintain or  reduce debt levels should economic or operating headwinds limit EBITDA growth. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Fitch expects comp sales to grow approximately 3% over the next two years,  supported by a continued recovery in the housing market and the company's  strategic investments; --EBITDA margin is expected to remain close to 16%, yielding 3 - 4% average  EBITDA growth; --Fitch expects $4.0 - $4.5 billion of annual FCF after dividends going forward; --Fitch expects FCF and some incremental borrowings to be directed to share  repurchases, as the company manages its adjusted leverage at or under 2.0x. RATING SENSITIVITIES Weaker operating trends or a move by management to more shareholder-friendly  policies that cause adjusted leverage to increase to the low 2x range on a  sustained basis could lead to a negative rating action. Continued positive operating trends together with a sustained reduction in  adjusted leverage to below 1.5x could lead to a positive rating action. LIQUIDITY Home Depot has a strong liquidity position supported by a cash balance of $2.2  billion at Jan. 31, 2016, together with an undrawn $2 billion credit facility.  The company also benefits from owning 90% of its stores. Home Depot is maintaining a very slow pace of new-store expansion, with plans to  build only five new stores in 2016. Low levels of capital expenditures (less  than 2% of sales) have resulted in strong FCF after dividends, which is expected  to track more than $4 billion annually going forward. Fitch expects Home Depot  would remain FCF positive in an economic downturn, as it did through the last  recession. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed Home Depot's ratings as follows: --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A';  --Senior unsecured notes at 'A'; --Bank credit facilities at 'A'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper at 'F1.'

295,HD,Home Depot settles consumer lawsuit over big 2014 data breach,"(Reuters) - Home Depot Inc agreed to pay at least $19.5 million to compensate U.S. consumers harmed by a 2014 data breach affecting more than 50 million cardholders. The home improvement retailer will set up a $13 million fund to reimburse shoppers for out-of-pocket losses, and spend at least $6.5 million to fund 1-1/2 years of cardholder identity protection services. Home Depot also agreed to improve data security over a two-year period, and hire a chief information security officer to oversee its progress. It will separately pay legal fees and related costs for affected consumers. Terms of the preliminary settlement were disclosed in papers filed on Monday with the federal court in Atlanta, where Home Depot is based. Home Depot did not admit wrongdoing or liability in agreeing to settle. The settlement requires court approval. “We wanted to put the litigation behind us, and this was the most expeditious path,” spokesman Stephen Holmes said. “Customers were never responsible for any fraudulent charges.” Home Depot has said the breach affected people who used payment cards on its self-checkout terminals in U.S. and Canadian stores between April and September 2014. It has said the intruder used a vendor’s user name and password to infiltrate its computer network, and used custom-built malware to access shoppers’ payment card information. The accord covers about 40 million people who had payment card data stolen, and 52 million to 53 million people who had email addresses stolen, with some overlap between the groups. Home Depot said it has booked $161 million of pre-tax expenses for the breach, including for the consumer settlement, and after accounting for expected insurance proceeds. Lawyers for the consumers said the accord compares “favorably” with other data breach class actions, including Target Corp’s $10 million settlement over a 2013 data breach that compromised at least 40 million cards. Legal fees and costs for the lawyers could top $8.7 million, court papers showed. At least 57 proposed class action lawsuits were filed in U.S. and Canadian courts over the data breach.

299,HD,Amazon says home services orders grew 20 pct per month since launch,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc said on Wednesday customer orders for home services like plumbing and mounting TVs had increased 20 percent per month on average since the online retailer launched the platform last year.  The marketplace allows Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, to enter the lucrative field of local services that is already crowded with review sites like Yelp Inc, Angie’s List and start-ups like TaskRabbit. Adding local services to its offering makes sense for Amazon, which has said that over 85 million U.S. customers shop for products that require additional services like installation.   Erika Takeuchi, a spokeswoman for Amazon Home Services, declined to disclose the number of contractors that have so far signed up for the service but said it now offers 36 million pre-packaged services on the site, up from 2 million when it first began offering local services last year. Customers buying appliances like washing machines or TVs can choose to include professional installation services at checkout, making it attractive to buyers who might ordinarily make similar purchases at home improvement stores like Home Depot Inc.  Home services are now available across the country in 30 metropolitan areas and customer orders have been particularly brisk in New York, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., Amazon said.

All times in ET/GMT) U.S. consumer prices likely picked up in April on rising gasoline and rental costs, pointing to a steady increase in inflation that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates later this year. The consumer price index likely increased 0.3 percent last month, according to a Reuters survey of economists, after edging up 0.1 percent in March. Excluding food and energy, the so-called core CPI is forecast to rise 0.2 percent after March’s 0.1 percent increase. (0830/1230) Housing starts are expected to have gained to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.127 million units and building permits are also likely to have increased to a 1.130 million units. (0830/1230) Industrial production probably rebounded in April by 0.3 percent, after an unexpected fall of 0.6 percent in March. (0915/1315) Two top Federal Reserve officials, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President John Williams and Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Dennis Lockhart, give their latest views on the U.S. economic outlook with the central bank’s next policy meeting five weeks away. Both have been upbeat recently on the health of the U.S. economy, but neither has so far publicly agitated for raising rates in June. (1225 /1625) Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan, whose dovish views on monetary policy align with much of the Fed’s core, participates in a moderated question-and-answer session before a community forum hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas in Midland, Texas, where the oil slump has cost jobs and created a sense of devastation. (1315 /1715) Separately, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew addresses the Jewish Theological Seminary Commencement Ceremony in New York. (1040/1440) Home Depot Inc, the world’s largest home improvement chain sales, is expected to report first-quarter sales above analysts’ average estimate. The company likely benefited from higher spending by customers on homes and home improvement than on discretionary categories such as clothes. Off-price retailer TJX Cos Inc is expected to report first-quarter profit above the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Investors will look for sales forecast for the second quarter and the retailer’s international expansion plans. JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO Jamie Dimon may give some of his current insights into the U.S. and global economies when he addresses shareholders at what is expected to be one of the least dramatic of the bank’s recent annual meetings. The company has modified its executive pay plan since the 2015 meeting to address criticism from proxy advisers who had recommended shareholders disapprove of the plan. Canada’s manufacturing sales are expected to have declined by 1.8 percent in March, adding to the previous month’s decline. A drop in sales of petroleum products due to a fall in prices was partly responsible for February’s decline and investors will look for signs the sector is finding a bottom. Chile’s central bank sets interest rate. Caught between high inflation and anemic growth, the bank has hinted that it is unlikely to move in the near future, and most analysts are expecting a hold for the rest of 2016. Brazil’s Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles may announce the next central bank chief and his team at the ministry. Meirelles, a former banking executive who served as central bank president from 2003 to 2010, has said his top priority was to return transparency to public finances.

305,HD,Home Depot raises forecasts after strong start to the year,"(Reuters) - Home Depot Inc (HD.N) boosted its sales and profit forecasts for the year on Tuesday after a stronger-than-expected first quarter, driven by a healthy housing market and favorable weather that encouraged Americans to spruce up their homes. The company’s results stood in stark contrast to grim quarterly reports from retailers such as Macy’s Inc (M.N), which have been hit as consumers shift spending away from apparel and accessories to big-ticket items including cars and homes. “After last week’s dismal set of retail trading updates, Home Depot provides some much needed relief and also an indication of where consumers are spending their money,” Håkon Helgesen, an analyst at research firm Conlumino, said in a note. However, shares of the No. 1 home improvement chain were down 1.9 percent at $132.72 in a weaker market at midday as some investors concluded that the stock had run its course for now. “With shares trading at a premium to historical averages and expectations for slower profit margin improvement going forward as the company is at peak profit margins, we believe shares fully reflect the company’s high growth expectations,” Edward Jones analyst Robin Diedrich wrote in a note. Up to Monday’s close, Home Depot’s shares had risen 19.4 percent in the past year, outperforming the S&P; 500 consumer discretionary index’s .SPLRCD rise of 2.7 percent. Home Depot said its strong start to the year was characterized by weather-related demand spikes that added $250 million to sales in the quarter. Sales of products priced at more than $900 rose 9.5 percent in the quarter ended May 1, with strong sales of appliances, roofing, sheds and windows, the company said. Home Depot’s sales U.S. stores open for more than a year rose 7.4 percent, well above the 4.9 percent average forecast of analysts surveyed by research firm Consensus Metrix. “We believe that February was the strongest month, driven by a ‘warm winter’ and unseasonal weather last year in many areas,” J.P. Morgan analyst Christopher Horvers wrote in a client note. “March was solid and then April slowed with normal spring weather volatility affecting sales.” Warm weather during February gave the company a great start to the year as outdoor projects took off strongly in the North,  Chief Executive Craig Menear said on a call with analysts, adding that spring weather had yet to arrive in many markets. Strength in the U.S. housing market is likely to continue, the company said. “While U.S. GDP forecasts have pulled back slightly since we built our 2016 sales plan, we continue to see strength in the housing market, with home price appreciation (and) housing turnover and household formation trending where we thought they would,” Chief Financial Officer Carol Tomé said on the call. U.S. housing starts rose a stronger-than-expected 6.6 percent in April, data showed on Tuesday. Housing starts hit their highest level in five months in February, before falling more than expected in March. Home Depot’s net income rose 14 percent to $1.80 billion, or $1.44 per share, in the quarter while net sales increased 9 percent to $22.76 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.36 per share and revenue of $22.39 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company said it now expected full-year earnings of about $6.27 per share, with overall sales growing about 6.3 percent and comparable sales increasing by about 4.9 percent. Shares of Home Depot rival Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N), which will report on Wednesday, were down 1 percent at midday.

306,HD,US STOCKS-Wall St sells off as rate hike expectations rise,"* April consumer prices record biggest gain in over 3 years * Home Depot falls after results, weighs on Dow, S&P; * AbbVie shares tumble on patent concerns for top drug * Indexes down: Dow 1.01 pct, S&P; 0.96 pct, Nasdaq 1.13 pct   (Updates with late afternoon trading) By Lewis Krauskopf May 17 (Reuters) - Wall Street sold off on Tuesday as investors boosted chances of an interest rate hike later this year after data pointed to firming inflation, while Home Depot weighed after its quarterly report. U.S. consumer prices recorded their biggest increase in more than three years in April as gasoline and rents rose. The data  pointed to a steady inflation build-up that could give the Federal Reserve ammunition to raise interest rates later this year. Two Fed policymakers on Tuesday said the central bank could still raise interest rates two or three times this year. Traders now see the probability of a rate hike after the Fed’s November meeting at 55 percent, up from roughly 42 percent on Monday, according to the CME FedWatch tool. “This morning the economic news was generally favorable suggesting that ... the U.S. economy has improved to levels warranting something other that crisis-level rates,” said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. The major U.S. stock market indexes slid back after rallying sharply on Monday. The S&P; 500 is little changed in 2016. While the benchmark index has risen about 13 percent since February lows, the rally fizzled out in the last few weeks amid mixed corporate earnings and economic data. “We seem completely unable to break out of the ranges this year,” said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. “For every step forward in the market like yesterday, it just seems like it’s met with a step back on a day like today.” The Dow Jones industrial average was down 178.78 points, or 1.01 percent, to 17,531.93, the S&P; 500 had lost 19.87 points, or 0.96 percent, to 2,046.79 and the Nasdaq Composite had dropped 53.93 points, or 1.13 percent, to 4,721.53. Utilities and consumer staples, both high-dividend-paying groups that tend to be sold when the expectation of higher rates increases, were the worst performing S&P; sectors. All ten sectors were lower. Home Depot boosted its sales and profit forecasts for the year after a stronger-than-expected first quarter. But its shares, which have outperformed the consumer discretionary sector over the past year and last week touched an all-time high, dropped 2.7 percent in afternoon trading and were among the biggest drags on the S&P; 500 and the Dow. Gloomy reports from retailers had clouded the market last week. Wal-Mart and Target are set to report results later this week. AbbVie was down 4.9 percent at $59.41 after Coherus  said the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office agreed to review its petition to make a copy of AbbVie’s top-selling drug. Coherus was up 13.9 percent at $18.53. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,921 to 1,052, for a 1.83-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,901 issues fell and 883 advanced for a 2.15-to-1 ratio favoring decliners. The S&P; 500 posted 7 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 18 new highs and 66 new lows.

The company’s net income rose to $1.80 billion, or $1.44 per share in the first quarter ended May 1, from $1.58 billion, or $1.21 per share, a year earlier.

312,HD,Lowe's sales beat estimates; shares hit record high,"(Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) followed larger rival Home Depot Inc (HD.N) in reporting better-than-expected quarterly sales as strength in the U.S. housing market and favorable weather powered demand for building and home renovation products. Shares of the home improvement chain, which also raised its profit forecast for the year ending Feb. 3, rose as much as 4 percent to a record high of $79.08, boosting the company’s market value by about $2.5 billion. In contrast, Home Depot’s shares fell as much as 3 percent after reporting results on Tuesday, as investors viewed the stock as fairly valued following a more than 19 percent gain in the 12 months to Monday’s close. Lowe’s stock rose only 5 percent in the period.  Investors had been relatively negative on Lowe’s stock prior to the earnings and the stock was “cheap” compared to the past three years, J.P. Morgan analyst Christopher Horvers wrote. The outlook for the home-improvement industry remained positive for the rest of the year as gains in the job market and disposable income drive consumer spending, Chief Executive Robert Niblock said on a conference call on Wednesday. U.S. housing starts rose a stronger-than-expected 6.6 percent in April, data showed on Tuesday. Rising home prices were also encouraging consumers to invest in their houses, Niblock added. “The home improvement industry once again shows its resilient nature in an increasingly more difficult environment for retailers,” Horvers wrote. Retailers such as Macy’s Inc (M.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N) reported quarterly sales that missed Wall Street’s estimates as consumer spending shifts away from apparel and accessories to big-ticket items including cars and homes. Separately, New York’s Attorney General Eric Schneiderman reached a settlement with Lowe’s and Home Depot over alleged violations of a 2010 state law designed to reduce water pollution. The attorney general alleged that 90 percent of Home Depot and Lowe’s stores in New York violated the law by displaying phosphorus-containing lawn fertilizers without the required signage or failing to separate phosphorus-containing fertilizers from those without it. Lowe’s agreed to pay $52,000 and Home Depot $78,000 in fines. Lowe’s told Reuters that most of its fertilizers did not contain phosphorous and that its signage complied with the law. The company, however, agreed to settle to avoid lengthy litigation.  SAME-STORE SALES BEAT  Lowe’s raised its full-year profit forecast to about $4.11 per share from about $4.00. The company’s same-store sales rose 7.3 percent in the first quarter, handily beating the 4.3 percent increase expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix.    The jump also outpaced the 6.5 percent rise reported by Home Depot, only the second time Lowe’s has outpaced its rival in nearly seven years.   The rise in Lowe’s same-store sales increase also handily beat the 4.3 percent increase expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix.   Mild weather in February helped drive outdoor construction projects, boosting demand for lumber, building materials and millwork, the company said. Excluding items, Lowe’s earned 87 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 85 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales rose 7.8 percent to $15.23 billion, above analysts’ average estimate of $14.87 billion.

316,HD,UPDATE 4-Heat wave tests Southern California's power grid amid gas shortage,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California’s power grid operators warned homes and businesses on Monday to conserve electricity as rising demand for air conditioning stoked by a record-setting heat wave across the U.S. Southwest tested the region’s generating capacity. The so-called Flex Alert was posted until 9 p.m. Pacific time during a second day of triple-digit temperatures that strained Southern California’s energy production, creating a potential for rolling blackouts on the first official day of summer. But the peak hour for energy demand came and went Monday evening without disruption of the region’s power delivery network, the California Independent System Operator (ISO) reported. “Since we’re past that and have not experienced any trouble, I think we’re headed into the safe zone,” agency spokeswoman Anne Gonzales told Reuters. Temperatures were expected to begin abating on Tuesday, according to weather forecasts. As of Monday night, there were no plans to extend the Flex Alert, ISO officials said. Monday’s alert was the first big test of power generators’ ability to meet heightened energy demands in the greater Los Angeles area without natural gas supplies normally furnished by the now-crippled Aliso Canyon gas storage field, effectively idled since a major well rupture there last fall. The oven-like heat prompted the city of Los Angeles to keep its network of public “cooling centers” - libraries, recreation centers and senior centers - open for extended hours as a haven for people whose homes lack air conditioning. Area home improvement and hardware merchants were doing a brisk business in fans and AC window units. Brett Lopes, 31, a freelance lighting technician, stopped in a Home Depot outlet near downtown to buy supplies for a homemade air conditioner he called a “swamp cooler” to use while he waited for his landlord to repair his broken AC unit. “It’s brutal,” he said of the heat, explaining that he looked up directions on YouTube for assembling the makeshift cooling device. “It doesn’t work as well as AC, but it’s better than sitting in 100 degrees.” Others flocked to public swimming pools.  “It was really refreshing today, but more crowded than usual,” said Paul Stephens, 31, a pastor who was swimming laps at the Rose Bowl Aquatic Center in Pasadena, where the mercury climbed to 108 Fahrenheit (42 Celsius) . The ISO, which runs the state’s power grid, urged consumers on Monday to cut back on electricity usage, especially during late-afternoon hours. Utility customers were advised to turn off unnecessary lights, set air conditioners to 78 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, and wait until after 9 p.m. to run major appliances, such as clothes washers and dryers. Gonzales credited public cooperation with the flex alert for likely helping avert widespread outages on Monday. Large stretches of three states sweltered in a second straight day of record, triple-digit temperatures, as the National Weather Service posted excessive-heat warnings through Wednesday for southern portions of California, Arizona and Nevada, though the hot spell appeared to have peaked on Monday. Power customers ranging from homes and hospitals to oil refineries and airports are at risk of losing energy at some point this summer because a majority of electric-generating stations in California use gas as their primary fuel.  Since the energy crisis of 2000-2001, the ISO has imposed brief, rotating outages in 2004, 2005, 2010 and 2015, mostly related to unexpected transmission line or power plant failures during periods of unusually high demand. With California’s largest natural gas storage field shut down indefinitely at Aliso Canyon, state regulators have warned that Los Angeles faces up to 14 days of gas shortages severe enough to trigger blackouts this summer.      Aliso Canyon, owned by Southern California Gas Co, a division of San Diego-based utility giant Sempra Energy, normally supplies the region’s 17 gas-fired power plants, hospitals, refineries and other key parts of California’s economy, including 21 million residents. The gas leak there, ranking as the worst-ever accidental methane release in the United States, forced thousands of nearby residents from their homes for several months after it was detected last October. The leak was finally plugged in February. ",6212016,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-california-heatwave/update-4-heat-wave-tests-southern-californias-power-grid-amid-gas-shortage-idUSL4N19C48U
317,HD,"Amid 'Brexit' selloff, some fund managers are bargain shopping","NEW YORK, June 24 (Reuters) - Britain’s unexpected decision to leave the European Union spurred a global stock market selloff that has inspired some opportunistic U.S. investors to move in the opposite direction. Operating on the belief that the initial rout might be an overreaction, even in some European stocks, several fund managers said on Friday they were buying up shares of big blue chips, domestic companies that are insulated from a lot of European activity and even European companies that might have been oversold. “We are looking to put cash to work in some of our favorite companies which are cheaper today,” said Kevin Dreyer, the co-chief investment officer at Gamco Investors Inc, noting holdings such as razor blade and sunscreen-maker Edgewell Personal Care Co that were down more than 3 percent in morning trading. The benchmark S&P; 500 was also down about 3 percent in midday trading. Still, some investors gravitated toward U.S. companies that are relatively insulated from Europe and can withstand what many expect are coming referendums in France and Scotland over their EU membership. U.S. stocks and bonds are a “great” buying opportunity on Brexit, said Gregory Peters, a senior investment officer at Prudential Fixed Income with more than $621 billion of assets. “Uncertainty will be a multi-year event, which will clearly benefit the U.S. from rates to risk assets (except for financials), as the U.S. will benefit from capital flows,” he said. Several fund managers said they were drawn to U.S. companies that had little exposure to Europe. John Boland of Maple Capital Management, an investment manager based in Vermont, said his firm has been considering some stocks that look too beaten-down because of Brexit-induced turmoil. For example, he bought shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill  when it was below $400 a share early Friday. “They’re a U.S.-focused company, so it was illogical for them to be down. That’s what we’re looking for, companies that have no ties or minimal ties to the EU market,” Boland said. Salesforce.com Inc “looks to be the most mispriced based on the Brexit vote” among technology stocks because Europe accounts for only 17 percent of its revenue, FBN Securities said. And Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management, said he had put in buy orders Friday for companies such as Home Depot Inc that are more domestically oriented. Those who did take a chance on European shares during a selloff that sent the Euro Stoxx 50 index of blue-chips down about 7 percent said they focused on infrastructure companies with high recurring cash flows. Michael Underhill, a portfolio manager at RidgeWorth Investments, said that he was buying shares of Groupe Eurotunnel SE, which were down 14.5 percent, and Italian airport operator Atlantia SpA, which has fallen 9 percent, because he expects the market is over exaggerating the impact that the so-called ‘Brexit’ will have on European travel. “You will see some more passport controls and higher security, but at the end of the day the business of logistics and travel will keep grinding higher,” he said.

318,HD,Dividend-focused fund managers find more appeal in U.S. consumer stocks,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fund managers on the hunt for dividends find themselves wading into the shares of consumer companies that typically attract investors looking for growth instead.  One big reason for the move: traditional yield-heavy sectors like utilities and telecoms are trading at some of their highest valuations on record relative to the broad market. Fund managers see more to gain by buying companies that may offer capital gains alongside growing dividends at a time of low unemployment and an improving housing market.  Also, some consumer stocks look relatively cheap at a time when Amazon.com Inc and fast online shopping have been threatening to upend the retail sector. “We’ve been nibbling at very high quality discretionary companies that are now cheaper because of ‘Brexit’ and worries about Amazon,” said Ramona Persaud, a co-portfolio manager of the $7.8 billion Fidelity Equity-Income fund.  Companies that look poised to grow their dividends thanks to improving free cash flows are one standard deviation cheaper than traditional income-oriented companies measured by either price to earnings or price to book, she added. Overall, income-oriented funds have 10.1 percent of their portfolios invested in consumer discretionary companies, up from 8.1 percent three years ago, according to fund-tracker Morningstar. Cruise line operator Carnival Corp and big box retailers Home Depot Inc and Best Buy Co Inc are among those seeing new interest from income-oriented managers.  Each company offers a yield of 3.6 percent or less, on par with the 3.8 percent yield of utility-giant Duke Energy Corp. At the same time, Duke trades at a trailing price to earnings ratio of 21.6, compared with a 15.1 P/E of Carnival, which increased its dividend by 17 percent in April. The broad S&P; 500 trades at a trailing P/E of 19.6, according to Thomson Reuters data. Scott Moore, a portfolio manager of the $37 million Buffalo Dividend Focus fund, said his fund holds Home Depot in large part as a play on the housing market that will not be hurt by online shopping.  “This is a company in the discretionary space that’s not going to be disrupted by Amazon,” Moore said.

319,HD,Home Depot lifts profit forecast as housing market strengthens,"(Reuters) - Home Depot Inc (HD.N) reported a 9.3 percent rise in quarterly profit and boosted its full-year earnings forecast as it kept a tight lid on costs, while benefiting from a strong U.S. housing market.   Shares of the world’s largest home improvement retailer were up 1 percent at $138.42 in early trading on Tuesday. Home Depot and smaller rival Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) have benefited as consumers cut back spending on items such as apparel and accessories and instead spend more on houses and renovating and redecorating their homes. The company said there was increased demand for big-ticket items - or products that are priced above $900 - such as heating, ventilation and cooling products and home appliances and roofing. Sales of such products rose 8.1 percent in the second quarter ended July 31, accounting for about 20 percent of total U.S. sales.  “We are encouraged by the strength of our core business as U.S. housing market continues to recover,” Chief Financial Officer Carol Tome said on a post-earnings conference call. Low interest rates and a strengthening labor market are driving the housing sector. Home resales hit more than nine-year highs in May and June. July data will be released next week. Home Depot’s expenses were lower than expected for the quarter as its multi-year plan to cut supply-chain costs helped improve inventory management and lowered transportation costs, Chief Executive Craig Menear said on the call. The company said it expected full-year expenses to grow at about 32 percent of its sales growth rate, down from its previous forecast of about 40 percent. The company also raised its full-year earnings forecast to $6.31 per share from $6.27. Sales at Home Depot stores open more than a year rose 4.7 percent in the quarter ended July 31, matching the average analysts’ estimate, according to  research firm Consensus Metrix. Comparable sales at U.S. stores rose 5.4 percent. The company’s net income rose to $2.44 billion, or $1.97 per share, in the quarter from $2.23 billion, or $1.73 per share, a year earlier.    Net sales rose to $26.47 billion from $24.83 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.97 per share on revenue of $26.49 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

324,HD,UPDATE 2-Lowe's sales miss estimates as short spring hurts,"(Reuters) - Home improvement chain Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit and cut its full-year earnings forecast, hurt by a shorter spring in the northern United States and fewer big-ticket purchases at its stores. Lowe’s shares were down 6.8 percent in late morning trading on Wednesday. While Home Depot’s sales got a big boost from big-ticket items such as appliances and roofing products, Lowe’s reported average sales. Number of transactions worth over $500 rose 2.9 percent in the second quarter ended July 29, Lowe’s said. In contrast, Home Depot reported a 9.5 percent rise in big-ticket purchases worth over $900. Sales in northern United States were challenged by a short spring, which hindered outdoor projects, Lowe’s Chief Customer Officer Mike Jones said on a conference call. An early spring this year also led to a number of outdoor projects being moved to the first quarter from the traditional second quarter, hurting Lowe’s comparable sales, which fell 2.8 percent in May. Lowe’s gets a bigger chunk of its revenue from outdoor business, which benefited from a warmer-than-usual March and April, compared with Home Depot, Edward Jones analyst Robin Diedrich said. “That has come back to haunt them here in the second quarter,” Diedrich added. Lowe’s also lowered its full-year earnings forecast to $4.06 per share from $4.11, saying the cut reflected its acquisition of Canada’s Rona Inc that was completed in May. Net sales rose 5.3 percent to $18.26 billion, below the $18.45 billion analysts had expected. Home Depot’s sales rose 6.6 percent. Sales at Lowe’s stores open more than 13 months rose 2 percent, compared with the 4.1 percent growth expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix. Home Depot’s same-store sales rose 4.7 percent.  Lowe’s net income rose to $1.17 billion, or $1.31 per share, in the quarter, from $1.13 billion, or $1.20 per share, a year earlier.

KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating reflects Home Depot's strong track record of comparable store sales  (comps) growth, margin expansion and cash flow generation. Fitch expects the  company to maintain leverage (adjusted debt/EBITDAR) in line with its publicly  stated target of 2.0x over the forecast horizon. With $89 billion in 2015 sales, Home Depot holds the leading position in the  U.S. home improvement industry, which is amidst a recovery from the prior  housing recession. Fitch's rating anticipates a continued recovery as well as a  benign competitive environment. However, should the housing recovery stall,  Fitch believes Home Depot has the willingness and ability to use its cash flow  generation to maintain its leverage commitments. Solid Track Record Home Depot has grown comps and EBITDA margin every year since 2010, with 5%  average annual comps and EBITDA improvement of over 500bps from 2009 to 15.8% in  2015. Operating momentum has been supported by improvement in home improvement  industry fundamentals, especially regarding repair and maintenance projects.  Home improvement retailers have further benefited from benign industry square  footage growth (including very modest unit expansion from Home Depot and chief  competitor Lowes) and competitive resilience to the discount and online  channels.  Success in the home improvement industry requires significant investments in  inventory breadth and customer service, and discounters generally focus on  categories with narrow assortment needs and limited customer service. Online  competition, meanwhile, has been limited due to short purchase windows and the  bulky/heavy nature of home improvement inventory (note that nearly half of Home  Depot's existing online sales involve in-store merchandise pickup). Continued Growth Expected Fitch anticipates continued sales and EBITDA growth over the forecast horizon,  predicated on a continued U.S. housing market recovery and Home Depot's focus on  its strategic pillars of customer service, product leadership, capital  allocation, and interconnected retail. The company's growth initiatives are  designed to leverage Home Depot's existing scale to broaden its customer base  and share of wallet. For example, the recent acquisition of Interline Brands  gives Home Depot access to the underpenetrated residential facility maintenance  and repair market. Meanwhile, Home Depot is using its online infrastructure to  expand product assortment and offer customers increased product knowledge, while  promoting its in-store pickup capability. Fitch believes successful execution of its initiatives, coupled with industry  tailwinds, will allow Home Depot to generate 2% - 4% annual comps and revenue  growth over time. EBITDA margins are expected to remain around 16% though Home  Depot could leverage fixed expenses at the high end of its comps range. Modest  annual EBITDA growth is projected to yield annual free cash flow (FCF) of $4.0 -  $4.5 billion after dividends of approximately $3.5 - $4.0 billion. Disciplined Capital Allocation Home Depot's scale and stable growth has allowed it to comfortably manage to its  adjusted leverage target of 2.0x for several years (1.9x at year-end 2015).  Fitch expects management to continue to balance its leverage target against its  goal to return cash to shareholders, with incremental debt issuance expected to  support share purchases. Given Home Depot's leverage commitment, Fitch believes  management could pull back on share repurchase to maintain or reduce debt levels  should economic or operating headwinds limit EBITDA growth. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Fitch expects Home Depot to produce comps in the 3% - 5% range over the next  two years, supported by a continued recovery in the housing market and the  company's strategic investments; --EBITDA margin is expected to remain close to 16%, yielding 3 - 4% average  EBITDA growth; --Fitch expects $4.0 - $4.5 billion of annual FCF after dividends going forward; --Fitch expects FCF and some incremental borrowings to be directed to share  repurchases, as the company manages to its adjusted leverage target of 2.0x. RATING SENSITIVITIES Weaker operating trends or a move by management to more shareholder-friendly  policies that cause adjusted leverage to increase to the low 2x range on a  sustained basis could lead to a negative rating action. Continued positive operating trends together with a sustained reduction in  adjusted leverage to below 1.5x could lead to a positive rating action. LIQUIDITY Home Depot has a strong liquidity position supported by a cash balance of $4.0  billion at July 31, 2016, together with an undrawn $2 billion credit facility.  The company also benefits from owning 90% of its stores. Home Depot is maintaining a very slow pace of new-store expansion, with plans to  build only five new stores in 2016. Low levels of capital expenditures (less  than 2% of sales) have resulted in strong FCF after dividends, which is expected  to track more than $4 billion annually going forward. Fitch expects Home Depot  would remain FCF positive in an economic downturn, as it did through the last  recession. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Home Depot's as follows: --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A';  --Senior unsecured notes 'A'; --Bank credit facilities 'A'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'; --Commercial paper 'F1'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

331,HD,"Home Depot maintains full-year sales forecast, disappointing investors","(Reuters) - Home Depot Inc (HD.N), the No. 1 U.S. home improvement chain, did not lift its full-year sales forecast, implying a weaker-than-expected fourth quarter amid an improving housing market and higher consumer spending in the United States. The company also raised its full-year earnings forecast only to account for lower tax provisions and outstanding share count. Home Depot shares fell as much as 3 percent on Tuesday morning, reversing course from premarket when they gained after the company reported third-quarter profit and sales that beat analysts’ estimates. The company, along with smaller rival Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) is benefiting from higher wages and as rising home values as well as tightening for-sale inventories in many markets spur remodeling activity by homeowners. Recent housing data has also suggested that overall residential construction may rise again in the current quarter. However, Home Depot said it expects full-year net sales to rise about 6.3 percent and comparable sales to increase about 4.9 percent, maintaining a forecast that it first gave in mid-May when it reported first-quarter results. Home Depot raised its adjusted earnings forecast by 2 cents to $6.33 per share for the year ending January 2017. Analysts on average were expecting Home Depot’s net sales to increase 6.4 percent and the company to earn $6.33 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The full-year forecast implied that Home Depot was expecting comparable store sale to increase 3 percent in the fourth quarter, less than analysts’ estimates of 4 percent and the 5.5 percent growth in the third quarter, Credit Suisse analyst Seth Sigman wrote in a note. “We don’t think there is anything in the Q3 results that would indicate a slowdown ... and the outlook for 2017 seems quite healthy at this point,” Sigman said. Home Depot said the number of customer transactions rose 2.4 percent in the third quarter. Customers also spent 3 percent more on average per transaction, the strongest in two years, according to Jefferies’ analysts. “We believe home price appreciation, housing turnover, household formation and an aging housing stock in the U.S. continue to support growth in our business,” Chief Executive Craig Menear said on a conference call. Transactions over $900 were up 11.3 percent, driven by sales of appliances and flooring and roofing products, Home Depot said. The company estimated sales related to Hurricane Matthew and flooding in Louisiana were about $100 million. Net sales increased 6.1 percent to $23.15 billion in the quarter, while net earnings rose 14.1 percent to $1.97 billion, or $1.60 per share. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.58 per share and sales of $23.04 billion. Shares of Lowe’s, which is scheduled to report results on Wednesday, were down 0.7 percent.

332,HD,WRAPUP 3-Strong U.S. retail sales reinforce December interest rate hike,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales rose more than expected in October as households bought motor vehicles and a range of other goods, pointing to sustained economic strength that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month. The Commerce Department said on Tuesday retail sales increased 0.8 percent last month, also boosted by demand for building materials, likely as households cleaned up and made repairs in the wake of Hurricane Matthew.  “This is just the kind of data the Fed doves need to see to convince them to hike rates in December. The economy is doing pretty well, this data is bullish for the economic outlook in the months ahead,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.  Adding to the report’s strong tone, September retail sales were revised up to show a 1.0 percent increase instead of the previously reported 0.6 percent rise. The combined September and October sales gain was the largest two-month rise since early 2014. Sales were up 4.3 percent from a year ago.  Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales jumped 0.8 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.3 percent gain in September. These so-called core retail sales, which correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product, were previously reported to have risen 0.1 percent in September.  Economists had forecast overall retail sales increasing 0.6 percent and core sales advancing 0.3 percent last month.  The strong sales report is a good omen heading into the holiday shopping season. Last week, Macy’s and Kohl’s Corp expressed optimism about the holiday shopping season, despite reporting a decline in sales in the third quarter. U.S. stocks were trading mostly higher, while the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasuries rose after declining for five straight trading sessions. September’s upward revision to core retail sales suggests that the economy’s 2.9 percent annualized growth rate in the third quarter could be raised when the government publishes its second GDP estimate later this month.  Coming on the heels of data this month showing a rapidly tightening labor market and signs of a turnaround in the manufacturing sector, the upbeat retail sales report implied a pickup in economic activity early in the fourth quarter.  The Atlanta Fed lifted its fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 3.3 percent rate after Tuesday’s data.      The report also reinforced views that the Fed will raise interest rates at its Dec. 13-14 policy meeting.  Rate hike prospects have also been boosted by a rally in U.S. stocks in the wake of the last week’s election of Republican candidate Donald Trump as the next president, despite a lot of hand-wringing over his proposed policies. The Fed this month left interest rates unchanged but said its monetary policy-setting committee “judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen.” The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate last December and has held it steady since, largely because of concerns over low inflation. But inflation is creeping higher. A separate report on Tuesday from the Labor Department showed import prices increased 0.5 percent in October after gaining 0.2 percent in September.     In the 12 months through October, import prices fell 0.2 percent, the smallest decrease since July 2014, after declining 1.0 percent in September.  Retail sales last month were driven by a 1.1 percent increase in auto sales and a 1.5 percent surge in receipts at online retailers. Online retailers like Amazon have been grabbing market share from traditional department chains like Macy’s and Kohl’s.  Sales at building material stores increased 1.1 percent following a 1.8 percent rise in September. The strength in this category was reflected in Home Depot’s robust third-quarter profit and sales reported on Tuesday. Receipts at sporting goods and hobby stores rose 1.3 percent. Sales at restaurants and bars, however, fell 0.7 percent, likely as the stormy weather kept people at home. Households also spent more on clothing, groceries and grooming last month, but cut back on furniture. Receipts at service stations advanced 2.2 percent on rising gasoline prices.  “As uncertainty over the election outcome remains elevated, October’s retail sales performance provides some comfort that the primary driver of U.S. GDP growth remains on solid footing,” said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

337,HD,"Lowe's third-quarter results disappoint, in contrast to rival Home Depot","(Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N), the No. 2 U.S. home improvement chain, reported disappointing quarterly results and tempered its full-year forecast as fewer of its do-it-yourself customers remodeled homes due to an unseasonably hot fall season. The company’s results were in sharp contrast to market leader Home Depot Inc (HD.N), whose focus on professional contractors helped it report better-than-expected sales and profit amid a strong housing market. Lowe’s shares fell as much as 5.6 percent on Wednesday, while Home Depot’s shares were up 0.5 percent. “Weather was a problem in the first part of the quarter,” Lowe’s Chief Executive Robert Niblock told Reuters. “There was a lot of extreme heat across the country.” U.S. home improvement retailers have generally been benefiting from higher wage growth and increased home remodeling by homeowners seeking better list prices amid tightening for-sale inventories. But Lowe’s focus on the do-it-yourself customer - a strategy that had helped it outperform Home Depot in a stronger economy - has been curbing the company’s growth. “When you look at the store base, Lowe’s tends to be in some small and mid-size markets and there’s been more of a lag in terms of economic recovery in a lot of those markets,” Edward Jones analyst Robin Diedrich said. “Home Depot has more of its stores in larger areas, larger suburbs and larger cities where there has been a better recovery overall. (The company) has a higher percentage of their business attracting professional customers ... right now the pro customer has been stronger.” Lowe’s said on Wednesday that sales at its U.S. stores open for at least a year rose 2.6 percent in the third quarter ended Oct. 28 as traffic slowed more than it anticipated in August and September. Home Depot reported same-store sales growth of 5.9 percent for the period. Lowe’s big-ticket purchases, or transactions over $500, rose 4.3 percent in the quarter, helped by appliances and outdoor products, the company said. Home Depot said transactions over $900, indicative of big-ticket purchases at its stores, rose 11.1 percent in the quarter. Big-ticket purchases are mostly driven by professional customers, a section that accounts for about 40 percent of Home Depot’s business. Lowe’s has been trying to win more professional customers, who now account for nearly a third of its overall business, Niblock said. “We’ve been focused on getting the right brands, getting the depth of inventory, making sure we’ve the right resources in the market to be able to call on larger pro customers,” he said. Lowe’s net sales rose 9.6 percent to $15.74 billion in the latest quarter, missing analysts average estimate of $15.86 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income fell to $379 million from $736 million due to non-cash pretax charges of $462 million. Excluding items, the company’s profit of 88 cents per share was 8 cents short of analysts’ estimates. Lowe’s also cut its full-year earnings forecast to $3.52 per share from $4.06. It tempered it sales growth forecast to 9-10 percent from a previous view of 10 percent growth. Home Depot had raised its full-year profit forecast and maintained its sales forecast. Lowe’s shares were down 3.7 percent at $66.52 in afternoon trading.

341,HD,"Home Depot's profit beat, $15 billion buyback lift shares to new high","(Reuters) - Home Depot Inc (HD.N) reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit and sales, boosted by a strong housing market in the United States, and set a $15 billion share repurchase program. Shares of the company, which also forecast 2017 sales ahead of Wall Street estimates, rose as much as 2 percent to a record high of $145.65 in morning trading on Tuesday. The company remains a bright spot in the retail sector as a firming economy, higher wages and an increase in the value of homes have spurred remodeling activity by homeowners. “Home Depot is gaining share in a number of high value categories, including appliances,” GlobalData Retail analyst Håkon Helgesen wrote in a note.  “Part of this is down to the poor performance of Sears, which has traditionally been a destination for appliance purchasers, but is now ceding share,” he said.  Home Depot, the biggest U.S. home improvement retailer, said transactions over $900, which represent about 20 percent of the company’s U.S. sales, were up 11.6 percent during the holiday quarter, as customers spent more on flooring products and appliances. In contrast, a focus on the do-it-yourself customer has been curbing growth at closest rival Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N). The  company is scheduled to report its holiday-quarter results next week. Atlanta, Georgia-based Home Depot said it expected 2017 sales to increase 4.6 percent, which translates to $98.95 billion. Analysts on average were expecting $98.45 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.     “Turning to 2017, overall GDP growth and strength in the U.S. housing market should continue to support growth in our business,” Chief Executive Officer Craig Menear said on a post-earnings call. The company’s same-store sales rose 5.8 percent during the three months ended Jan. 29, beating analysts’ average estimate of a rise of 3.5 percent, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. Quarterly sales rose 5.8 percent to $22.21 billion, beating the average analysts’ estimate of $21.81 billion.

342,HD,"UPDATE 3-Home Depot's profit beat, $15 bln buyback lift shares to new high","(Reuters) - Home Depot Inc (HD.N) reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit and sales, boosted by a strong housing market in the United States, and set a $15 billion share repurchase program. Shares of the company, which also forecast 2017 sales ahead of Wall Street estimates, rose as much as 2 percent to a record high of $145.65 in morning trading on Tuesday. The company remains a bright spot in the retail sector as a firming economy, higher wages and an increase in the value of homes have spurred remodeling activity by homeowners. “Home Depot is gaining share in a number of high value categories, including appliances,” GlobalData Retail analyst Håkon Helgesen wrote in a note.  “Part of this is down to the poor performance of Sears, which has traditionally been a destination for appliance purchasers, but is now ceding share,” he said.  Home Depot, the biggest U.S. home improvement retailer, said transactions over $900, which represent about 20 percent of the company’s U.S. sales, were up 11.6 percent during the holiday quarter, as customers spent more on flooring products and appliances. In contrast, a focus on the do-it-yourself customer has been curbing growth at closest rival Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N). The  company is scheduled to report its holiday-quarter results next week. Atlanta, Georgia-based Home Depot said it expected 2017 sales to increase 4.6 percent, which translates to $98.95 billion. Analysts on average were expecting $98.45 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.     “Turning to 2017, overall GDP growth and strength in the U.S. housing market should continue to support growth in our business,” Chief Executive Officer Craig Menear said on a post-earnings call. The company’s same-store sales rose 5.8 percent during the three months ended Jan. 29, beating analysts’ average estimate of a rise of 3.5 percent, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. Quarterly sales rose 5.8 percent to $22.21 billion, beating the average analysts’ estimate of $21.81 billion. Excluding certain items, Home Depot earned $1.44 per share, ahead of the Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S average estimate of $1.34. The company said its new buyback program replaces a previous authorization.

343,HD,US STOCKS-Wall St to open near record-highs on strong retail earnings,"* Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Macy’s rise after results * Dollar up on rate hike comments from Fed officials * Popeyes up after Restaurant Brands agrees to buy company * Futures up: Dow 61 pts, S&P; 4.5 pts, Nasdaq 9 pts   (Adds details, comment, updates prices) By Yashaswini Swamynathan Feb 21 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks looked set to open near record-highs on Tuesday as oil prices rose and investors cheered better-than-expected profits at top U.S. retailers. Shares of Wal-Mart and Home Depot are likely to be the top influencers on the Dow after the companies reported results. Wal-Mart was up 3.4 percent in premarket trading, while Home Depot rose 1.9 percent. Department store bellwether Macy’s also reported a better-than-expected profit, sending its shares up 3.2 percent. Investor sentiment was boosted by a more than 1.5 percent rise in oil prices, after OPEC said the group was hopeful of higher compliance with its deal to cut production. Strong earnings, robust economic data and the possibility of fiscal stimulus under President Donald Trump has lifted Wall Street’s main indexes to record highs in the past months. The dollar rose 0.58 percent after Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said on Sunday that she would be comfortable raising rates if the U.S. economy kept performing. Gold prices fell 0.74 percent. Investors will keep an eye on comments from three Federal Reserve officials on Tuesday for insight into the timing of the next interest rate hike. The Dow Jones Industrial Average marked its seventh-straight record close on Friday. The S&P; 500 and the Nasdaq Composite also closed at record levels. “The strong technical aspect along with rising oil prices and macro news will likely support another record closing session for the indices,” Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial wrote in a note. Wall Street was closed on Monday for the Presidents Day holiday. Dow e-minis were up 61 points, or 0.3 percent at 8:29 a.m. ET (1329 GMT), with 50,458 contracts changing hands. S&P; 500 e-minis were up 4.5 points, or 0.19 percent, with 237,087 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 9 points, or 0.17 percent, on volume of 48,520 contracts. Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen jumped 16.42 percent to $76.98 after Restaurant Brands agreed to acquire the quick-service restaurant chain for $1.8 billion. Kraft Heinz shares fell 4.9 percent after it walked away from its $143 billion offer to buy Unilever, a day after the Anglo-Dutch company rejected the proposal. Unilever’s U.S.-listed shares were down 8.4 percent. Freeport was down 5 percent at $14.16 after the miner warned on Monday it could take the Indonesian government to arbitration and seek damages over a dispute that has halted operations at a copper mine.

346,HD,"Fitch Affirms The Home Depot, Inc.'s IDR at 'A'; Outlook Stable","(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, February 22 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed its Long-Term Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) for The Home Depot, Inc. (Home Depot) at 'A'. The Rating  Outlook is Stable. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating reflects Home Depot's strong track record of comparable store sales  (comps) growth, margin expansion and cash flow generation. Fitch expects the  company to maintain leverage (adjusted debt/EBITDAR) in line with its publicly  stated target of 2x over the forecast horizon. With $95 billion in 2016 sales, Home Depot holds the leading position in the  U.S. home improvement industry, which is in the midst of a recovery from the  prior housing recession. Fitch's rating anticipates a continued recovery as well  as a benign competitive environment. However, should the housing recovery stall,  Fitch believes Home Depot has the willingness and ability to use its cash flow  generation to maintain its leverage commitments. Solid Track Record Home Depot has grown comps and EBITDA margin every year since 2010, with 5%  average annual comps and EBITDA improvement of over 600bps from 2009 to 16.6% in  2016. Operating momentum has been supported by improvement in home improvement  industry fundamentals, especially regarding repair and maintenance projects.  Home improvement retailers have further benefited from benign industry  square-footage growth (including very modest unit expansion from Home Depot and  chief competitor Lowes) and competitive resilience to the discount and online  channels.  Success in the home improvement industry requires significant investments in  inventory breadth and customer service, and discounters generally focus on  categories with narrow assortment needs and limited customer service. Online  competition, meanwhile, has been limited due to short purchase windows and the  bulky/heavy nature of home improvement inventory (note that nearly half of Home  Depot's existing online sales involve in-store merchandise pickup). Continued Growth Expected Fitch anticipates continued sales and EBITDA growth over the forecast horizon,  predicated on a continued U.S. housing market recovery and Home Depot's focus on  its strategic pillars of customer service; product leadership; capital  allocation; and interconnected retail. The company's growth initiatives are  designed to leverage Home Depot's existing scale to broaden its customer base  and share of wallet. For example, the 2015 acquisition of Interline Brands gives  Home Depot access to the underpenetrated residential facility maintenance and  repair market. Meanwhile, Home Depot is using its online infrastructure to  expand product assortment and offer customers increased product knowledge, while  promoting its in-store pickup capability. Fitch believes successful execution of its initiatives, coupled with industry  tailwinds, will allow Home Depot to generate 2%-4% annual comps and revenue  growth over time. EBITDA margins are expected to remain around 17% though Home  Depot could leverage fixed expenses at the high end of its comps range. Modest  annual EBITDA growth is projected to yield annual free cash flow (FCF) of $4  billion-$4.5 billion after dividends of $4.5 billion to $5 billion. Disciplined Capital Allocation Home Depot's scale and stable growth have allowed it to comfortably manage to  its adjusted leverage target of 2.0x for several years (1.8x at year-end 2016).  To the extent EBITDA continues to grow over the next two to three years, Fitch  expects Home Depot to issue debt to maintain leverage within its target. Excess  cash flow, including proceeds from debt issuance, is expected to be used to  support the company's dividend and share repurchase program. Given Home Depot's  leverage commitment, Fitch believes management could pull back on share  repurchase to maintain or reduce debt levels should economic or operating  headwinds limit EBITDA growth. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Fitch expects Home Depot to produce comps in the 3%-4% range over the next two  years, supported by a continued recovery in the housing market and the company's  strategic investments; --EBITDA margin is expected to remain close to 17%, yielding approximately 3%-4%  EBITDA growth; --Fitch expects $4 billion-$4.5 billion of annual FCF after dividends going  forward; --Fitch expects FCF and some incremental borrowings to be directed to share  repurchases as the company manages to its adjusted leverage target of 2x. RATING SENSITIVITIES Weaker operating trends or a move by management to more shareholder-friendly  policies that cause adjusted leverage to increase to the low 2x range on a  sustained basis could lead to a negative rating action. Continued positive operating trends together with a sustained reduction in  adjusted leverage to below 1.5x could lead to a positive rating action. LIQUIDITY Home Depot has a strong liquidity position supported by a cash balance of $2.5  billion at Jan. 29, 2017, together with an undrawn $2 billion credit facility.  The company also benefits from owning 90% of its stores. Home Depot is maintaining a very slow pace of new-store expansion, with plans to  build only six new stores in 2017. Low levels of capital expenditure (less than  2% of sales) have resulted in strong FCF after dividends, which is expected to  track more than $4 billion annually going forward. Fitch expects Home Depot  would remain FCF positive in an economic downturn, as it did through the last  recession. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed Home Depot's ratings as follows: --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A';  --Senior unsecured notes at 'A'; --Bank credit facilities at 'A'; --Short-Term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper at 'F1'.

347,HD,"UPDATE 4-Lowe's forecasts strong sales growth this year, shares soar","(Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) forecast 2017 sales that topped estimates and reported better-than-expected quarterly comparable sales and profit, helped by a robust housing market that encouraged Americans to spruce up their homes or buy new ones. Shares of the No. 2 U.S. home improvement retailer rose as much as 11.4 percent to $82.85 on Wednesday, their biggest intraday percentage gain in more than eight years. Homebuilding in the United States jumped 11.3 percent in December as a firming economy and higher wages boosted demand for housing. “Lowe’s has generated growth in its core, underlying business, and has done so at a pace that is well above the previous two quarters,” GlobalData retail analyst Hakon Helgesen wrote in a client note. The company reported a better-than-expected 5.1 percent rise in comparable sales in the fourth quarter - a strong rise after posting sales of 2.7 percent in the third quarter and 2 percent in the second quarter. Improvements in customer service, which include providing an enhanced level of advice for bigger projects, helped Lowe’s attract and convert more DIY customers and first-time homeowners, Helgesen added. “When you look at our 2017 guidance, we expect that our growth in sales will be driven by a continued increase in average ticket and a continued increase in transactions,” Chief Executive Officer Robert Niblock told Reuters. Total customer transactions rose 15.1 percent, while average spending by Lowe’s customers increased 3.6 percent in the latest quarter, which ended Feb. 3. Lowe’s also forecast 2017 sales of $68.27 billion and adjusted earnings of $4.64 per share, beating analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales rose 19.3 percent to $15.78 billion in the latest quarter, helped by its acquisition of Canada-based Rona Inc RON.TO in May. Analysts on average expected $15.39 billion. Excluding items, the company earned 86 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of 79 cents. Lowe’s same-store sales performance has lagged Home Depot Inc (HD.N) in the past several quarters, mainly due to its focus on do-it-yourself (DIY) customers, who spend less on big-ticket items compared with professionals. Home Depot, which gets about 40 percent of its revenue from professionals, reported a stronger-than-expected 5.8 percent rise in holiday-quarter comparable-store sales last month. In contrast, Mooresville, North Carolina-based Lowe’s gets only a third of its total sales from professional customers. Lowe’s said it expects comparable-store sales to rise 3.5 percent in 2017, while Home Depot forecast an increase of 4.6 percent.

350,HD,Home Depot must again face lawsuit over employee's murder: U.S. court,"(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Friday said Home Depot Inc must face a lawsuit claiming that the retailer’s negligence led to a supervisor’s murdering a pregnant employee by strangulation and raping her corpse. Reversing a lower court ruling, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago said Alisha Bromfield’s mother may pursue claims that Home Depot should not have employed the supervisor, given his known history of sexually harassing, verbally abusing and physically intimidating female subordinates. Home Depot spokesman Stephen Holmes said the Atlanta-based company is reviewing the decision. “Our deepest sympathies remain with the family, first and foremost,” he said. “We are very pleased with the reversal,” Kristin Barnette, the lawyer for Bromfield’s mother, Sherry Anicich, said in an interview. Bromfield, 21, was seven months pregnant in August 2012 when she was killed by Brian Cooper, for whom she had worked in Home Depot stores in Illinois since 2006, court papers show. Her unborn baby did not survive. Cooper was later convicted of intentional homicide and sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison without parole. The complaint said Bromfield had repeatedly complained to management about how Cooper treated women, including calling her a “slut” and “whore” in front of customers. Cooper eventually forced Bromfield to attend his sister’s wedding in Wisconsin or risk being fired, and killed her after she refused to enter a relationship, the complaint said. Last March, a lower court judge said Bromfield’s mother failed to plausibly allege that Home Depot had a duty to protect her from Cooper’s criminal conduct, justifying damages. But the appeals court said a reasonable jury could find that Home Depot and Grand Flower Growers, which the mother said jointly employed Cooper, should have foreseen he might “take the small further step” to violence. “Alisha’s story is an old story that has been told too many times,” Circuit Judge David Hamilton wrote. “Its ending is both shocking and predictable. Alisha’s family is entitled to try to prove its truth.” Grand Flower’s lawyers did not respond to requests for comment. Hamilton also criticized Home Depot’s argument that it would be “illogical and unworkable” to fire or demote workers because of their “usage of inappropriate language, or sexual misconduct,” to prevent a “future (hypothetical) murder.” “Home Depot asserts in its brief that it employs ‘thousands’ of such people,” Hamilton wrote in a footnote. “We hope this insult to the character of Home Depot’s employees and to the judgment of its managers was just an ill-advised exaggeration.” The case is Anicich v Home Depot USA Inc et al, 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 16-1693.

354,HD,Tesla says it will stop selling solar door-to-door,"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) on Friday said that its subsidiary SolarCity will curtail door-to-door sales of rooftop solar installations over the next month as Tesla seeks to absorb the company into its high-end brand. The move comes at a time when growth in sales of residential solar systems has slowed in key states, including California, where Tesla is based. Industry watchers say consumers in more mature solar markets have tired of the industry’s aggressive sales tactics. “We believe this decision reflects what most of our prospective customers prefer, and will result in a better experience for them,” a Tesla spokesperson said in an emailed statement. Tesla has built its luxury electric car brand on exclusivity, whereas SolarCity marketed its systems to a wide range of consumers mainly by promising cost savings. As a result, the move marks a major shift for SolarCity, which before its acquisition by Tesla had become the nation’s top solar installer by amassing a legion of sales representatives in solar-friendly states across the country. Though most sales are generated through customer referrals, door-to-door sales became a significant means of reaching new customers over the last three years.  Most affected employees will be reassigned to other sales channels or given the opportunity to interview for other positions, Tesla said. About 1,000 people work in door-to-door sales for the company. The company said it plans to expand its retail and online sales of solar systems, including in Tesla stores. It will also continue selling systems through long-standing partnerships with retailers, including Home Depot (HD.N) and Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N). “We expect the growth of these channels to end up more than offsetting the loss of door-to-door sales,” Tesla said.  Tesla, which completed its acquisition of SolarCity in November, has repeatedly said that it would prioritize preserving cash over increasing sales of solar systems. It has also said that it would reduce the cost of acquiring new customers, a metric that has remained stubbornly high across the highly competitive industry. In keeping with its move toward more distinctive solar offerings, Tesla has said it plans to roll out a line of solar roof tiles later this year. The solar-powered roof shingles were unveiled last October to showcase the benefits of combining Elon Musk’s electric car maker with the solar installer.

355,HD,Home Depot's profit tops on higher sales of big-ticket items,"(Reuters) - Home Depot Inc’s (HD.N) first-quarter profit and same-store sales topped estimates as customers spent more on expensive items such as appliances and flooring and roofing materials. The company’s shares rose about 2 percent to hit a record high of $160.83 in morning trading on Tuesday, after the No. 1 U.S. home improvement chain also said second-quarter sales were off to a good start. “While U.S. GDP forecasts are mixed, housing continues to be a growing asset class and our sales thus far in May have been very good,” Home Depot’s Chief Financial Officer Carol Tomé said on a conference call. Home Depot and smaller rival Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) have remained a bright spot in the retail sector as a firming economy and higher wages are driving new home sales and an increase in the value of existing houses has spurred remodeling activity. Home Depot’s results are in contrast to falling sales at department stores such as Macy’s Inc (M.N) and J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N), which are struggling with lower customer spending on apparel and growing competition from online and off-price retailers. Sales of big-ticket items, which are priced above $900 and account for a fifth of total sales, rose 15.8 percent in the first quarter ended April 30, Home Depot said. Sales at stores open for more than a year rose 5.5 percent, above the 3.9 percent growth expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix. Comparable sales at U.S. stores increased 6 percent. The number of customer transactions was up 1.6 percent in the quarter, while the average ticket value rose by about $2 to $62.39. Inflation in commodity prices of lumber, building materials and copper also boosted average ticket prices by about 75 basis points, the company said. Net income rose about 12 percent to $2.01 billion, or $1.67 per share, in the quarter. Net sales increased 5 percent to $23.89 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.62 per share on revenue of $23.76 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company also raised its earnings forecast for the year ending January 2018 to $7.15 per share from $7.13, citing anticipated share repurchases of $5 billion this year.

As the first-quarter earnings season wraps up, investors will turn their attention to political developments that could hamper President Donald Trump’s plans to bring in pro-growth policies. Investors were wary following reports that Trump disclosed highly classified information to Russia’s foreign minister about a planned Islamic State operation. The dollar index - which measures the greenback against six other major currencies - hit a six-month low, while prices of safe-haven gold rose. However, strong earnings including those of Dow component Home Depot, could lead markets higher. The No. 1 U.S. home improvement chain reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit, sending its shares up 2 percent in premarket trading. While earnings continue to support the indices, global geopolitical tensions and political developments in Washington could unsettle the market’s record-setting spree. “New accusations against Trump on intelligent secrets if expanded will be the catalyst to ignite a perfect storm (in the market),” Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First standard Financial, wrote in a note. Dow e-minis were up 33 points, or 0.16 percent at 8:31 a.m. ET (1331 GMT), with 17,792 contracts changing hands. S&P; 500 e-minis were up 1.75 points, or 0.07 percent, with 119,792 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 6.5 points, or 0.11 percent, on volume of 21,127 contracts. Wall Street closed higher on Monday with gains in technology, energy and financial stocks powering the S&P; and the Nasdaq to close at record levels. Oil prices edged up about 0.2 percent, prompted by the dollar’s decline and the expectation for a supply limit deal to extend into next year. Pfizer was off 1.6 percent at $32.56 after Citigroup downgraded the drug developer’s stock to “sell” from “neutral”. Akebia Therapeutics was up nearly 17 percent at $15.05 after the drug developer entered into an agreement with Vifor Pharma Group, which also made a $50 million equity investment in the company. Dick’s Sporting Goods tumbled 12 percent after the company reported lower-than-expected quarterly sales.

361,HD,Lowe's to buy maintenance supplies retailer for $512 million,"(Reuters) - U.S. home improvement retailer Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) said it would buy Maintenance Supply Headquarters, a wholesale retailer of maintenance supplies, for $512 million, as it seeks to sell more to construction contractors. Lowe’s is trying to better serve professional customers such as construction contractors amid fierce competition from larger rival Home Depot Inc (HD.N). Lowe’s has so far mainly focused on homeowners and do-it-yourself shoppers, who typically spend less on big-ticket items compared to professional customers. Home Depot, however, has already sharpened its focus on professionals, helping the company post strong sales in recent quarters amid a robust U.S. housing market. Houston-based Maintenance Supply Headquarters operates 13 distribution centers, mainly in the western, southeastern and south-central United States. The acquisition is expected to add to Lowe’s earnings in the year ending February 2018 and be completed in the quarter ending July. Goldman Sachs was Lowe’s financial adviser, while Hunton & Williams LLP provided legal counsel. Crutchfield Capital Corp was financial adviser to Maintenance Supply Headquarters, while Porter Hedges LLP was its legal adviser.

362,HD,Lowe's results disappoint in contrast to rival Home Depot,"(Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N), the No. 2 U.S. home improvement retailer, reported quarterly profit and comparable sales that missed analysts’ estimates, in contrast to the strong results reported by larger rival Home Depot Inc (HD.N) last week. Lowe’s shares were down 4 percent at $78.92 on Wednesday. The company blamed excess marketing focus on indoor product categories, such as appliances, at the cost of outdoor products for the weaker-than-expected comparable sales in the quarter.  This led to weak sales of outdoor products such as plants and patio furniture, which typically make up about 35 percent of the company’s sales in the first quarter, Chief Customer Officer Michael McDermott said on a conference call. Colder weather compared with March last year and flooding in St. Louis, Missouri, also hurt sales of seasonal products, the company said. Lowe’s said it expects to make up for the lost sales in the next two quarters, partly through changes to its marketing strategy to include more low-price products. The company’s focus on do-it-yourself customers has led it to lag Home Depot, whose focus on high-spending professional contractors has helped it benefit more from the strength in the housing market. Home Depot had cited higher demand for expensive items such as flooring and roofing materials amid a strong housing market for its bigger-than-expected sales for the three months ended April 30. Home improvement has remained a bright spot in the gloomy U.S. retail industry, as a strong labor market and historically low mortgage rates drive demand for housing. Sales at Lowe’s stores open at least for a year rose 1.9 percent, below the 2.6 percent rise expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix.   Net income fell 32 percent to $602 million, or 70 cents per share, in the first quarter ended May 5.   Lowe’s recorded a $464 million pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt in connection with its $1.6-billion cash tender offer.  Excluding items, the company earned $1.03 per share, missing the average analysts’ estimate of $1.06, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.    Net sales rose 10.7 percent to $16.86 billion, slightly below the average analysts’ estimate of $16.96 billion. The company maintained its sales forecast for the year ending Feb. 2, but reduced its profit forecast to $4.30 per share from $4.64 to reflect loss on extinguishment of debt.

Home Depot was down 3.1 percent and was the biggest drag for both the S&P; 500 and Dow. Although the home improvement chain reported strong earnings and raised its forecast, investors appeared to be worried about supply constraints in the housing market that could be a drag on Home Depot’s future earnings. Shares of smaller rival Lowe’s Cos were down more than 3 percent. The consumer discretionary index, down 0.8 percent, also took a hit from a steep fall in the shares of Coach and Advance Auto Parts after the companies reported disappointing results. However, data showed that U.S. retail sales recorded their biggest increase in seven months in July as consumers boosted purchases of motor vehicles as well as discretionary spending. The data helped the dollar touch its highest level against a basket of major currencies in nearly three weeks. “The retail sales numbers that came out today - that’s nothing but good news. We have a positive surprise for this month and upward revisions,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts. “People are spending but they’re not spending on the same things. From a company level perspective, there are winners and losers.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 12.63 points, or 0.06 percent, to 22,006.34, the S&P; 500 had gained 0.35 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,466.19 and the Nasdaq Composite had dropped 3.37 points, or 0.05 percent, to 6,336.86.

373,HD,Looming housing slowdown clouds Home Depot's strong results,"(Reuters) - Home Depot Inc (HD.N) raised its full-year forecasts but concerns over a looming slowdown in the U.S. housing market due to supply constraints weighed on the retailer’s stock. Shares of the No. 1 U.S. home improvement chain, which also reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit and comparable sales, fell nearly 4 percent in morning trading on Tuesday. The Dow component’s stock had risen 15 percent this year, as of Monday’s close. Smaller rival Lowe’s Cos Inc’s (LOW.N) stock was trading down about 3 percent. The U.S. housing market has been facing supply constraints, which has been pushing prices up. Higher lumber costs and shortages of labor and land have hampered home builders’ efforts to meet the rising demand, underpinned by a strong labor market.   “As positive as the housing market has been, there is a risk that activity will wane,” GlobalData Retail analyst Håkon Helgesen said in a client note. “The latest numbers suggest that transactions are down slightly - not because demand has dropped off, but because there is a shortage of housing.”  Home Depot, however, allayed fears of a slowdown seeping into demand for its products, citing higher spending on home improvement. “We expect to see continued growth in the repair and remodel market as the U.S. has experienced solid wage growth, faster home price appreciation, and the re-emergence of first-time homebuyers,” CFO Carol Tomé said on a conference call. Even if housing transactions do soften, the impact on Home Depot will not be immediate, analyst Helgesen said. The S&P; CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas, which tracks residential real estate prices, rose 5.7 percent in May on a year-over-year basis. Home Depot on Tuesday said demand from its contractor customers also remained strong. “Based on what we’re seeing in the stores today, our Pros (professional customers) are not on vacation,” Tomé added.

Home Depot’s 3.9 percent fall weighed the most on the Dow and the S&P.; Although the company’s quarterly earnings and comparable sales were strong, investors appeared to be worried about supply constraints in the housing market that could be a drag on Home Depot’s future earnings. Shares of smaller rival Lowes Cos were down 3 percent. The consumer discretionary index also took a hit from weak earnings at companies such as Coach and Advance Auto Parts. However, losses were capped by a rise in financial stocks, led by Synchrony Financial’s 4 percent rise. The company’s shares got a lift after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway said it had added a stake in the company. “Equities are headed towards pause mode,” said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. “There continues to be concerns over geopolitics, valuations, interest rates and perhaps to a degree, seasonal fatigue.” At 11:00 a.m. ET (1500 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 6.4 points, or 0.03 percent, at 22,000.11 and the S&P; 500 was down 1.39 points, or 0.05 percent, at 2,464.45.

Pyongyang’s plans to fire missiles near the U.S. Pacific territory prompted a surge in tensions in the region last week, with President Donald Trump saying the U.S. military was “locked and loaded” if North Korea acted unwisely. “I think it is a bit of a follow through on North Korea that has stepped back, things are back to somewhat normal”, said Mark Spellman, portfolio manager at Alpine Funds in New York. “U.S. companies and the markets have also been benefiting from the global economic expansion. For the first time in many years, you’ve got a lot of economies through out the world doing better,” Spellman added. At 9:42 a.m. ET (1342 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 29.01 points, or 0.13 percent, at 22,022.72, the S&P; 500 was up 1.17 points, or 0.05 percent, at 2,467.01. The Nasdaq Composite was up 1.12 points, or 0.02 percent, at 6,341.35. Six of the 11 major S&P; sectors were lower, with telecom sector’s 0.70 percent fall leading the decliners. Data showed U.S. retail sales recorded their biggest increase in seven months in July as consumers boosted purchases of motor vehicles as well as discretionary spending. The data helped the dollar touch its highest level against a basket of major currencies in nearly three weeks. Among stocks, Home Depot was down 2.6 percent, despite the U.S. home improvement chain reporting quarterly profit and comparable sales that topped estimates. The stock weighed the most on the Dow and the S&P; 500. Coach was off more than 6 percent after the handbag maker issued full-year sales forecast that missed analysts’ estimates. Dick’s Sporting Goods hit near seven-year lows after the sportswear retailer’s quarterly same-store sales and profit missed estimates. Advance Auto Parts touched near four-year low after the company lowered its 2017 comparable store sales forecast.

Harvey, the most powerful hurricane to strike the southern U.S. state in more than 50 years when it came ashore on Friday, dumped more rain on Houston on Monday, and the flooding could worsen as engineers release water from overflowing reservoirs to keep it from jumping dams and surging uncontrollably. U.S. crude futures fell 2.3 percent to $46.75 per barrel over concerns that the refinery shutdowns could trigger an increase in crude inventories. Gasoline prices, however, rose. Oil majors Exxon and Chevron were down 0.5 percent and 0.7 percent respectively. Refiner Valero Energy climbed 1.3 percent. The uncertainty pushed investors toward safe-haven assets, with gold rising to its highest in nearly 10 months. But the search for safe havens was accompanied by stock picking in Home Depot, which rose 1.1 percent, and other companies likely to benefit from rebuilding efforts in the region. “Home Depot will most certainly see a financial benefit from Hurricane Harvey, just as it did from Hurricane Sandy back in 2013,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. Insurer Travelers was the largest drag on the Dow with a 2.6 percent drop to $123.21, while Allstate fell 1.5 percent to $90.60 as investors assessed the likely impact of Harvey on the sector. The S&P; 500 financial sector was the largest weight on the index, with a 0.6 percent drop. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 19.62 points, or 0.09 percent, to 21,794.05, the S&P; 500 lost 0.41 point, or 0.02 percent, to 2,442.64 The Nasdaq Composite added 16.06 points, or 0.26 percent, to 6,281.70 helped by rises in Apple and Gilead Sciences. Kite Pharmaceuticals surged 28.1 percent to $178.25 after Gilead Sciences agreed to buy the immunotherapy developer in a deal valued at $11.9 billion. Shares of Gilead were up 1.3 percent.

Shares of insurers were down, as Harvey was set to dump more rain on Houston on Monday, worsening the flooding that has paralyzed the country’s energy hub. Harvey, the most powerful hurricane to strike Texas in more than 50 years, has knocked out a quarter of oil production from the Gulf of Mexico, prompting fears it could overturn years of excess U.S. oil capacity and low prices. U.S. crude futures, which earlier hit two-year highs, dipped more than 1 percent to $47.38 over concerns that refinery shutdowns could reduce demand for American crude. However, Home Depot was up 1.34 percent, boosting the Dow, while Lowe’s rose 2 percent as the two largest U.S. home improvement chains could be among the biggest beneficiaries of post-Harvey recovery. “The unfortunate event from Hurricane Harvey will have some sort of impact on the numbers, down the line ... at this point, it does not appear to affect equities,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital. U.S. economic growth had more than halved in the quarter after Hurricane Katrina mauled Louisiana in August 2005. “The Wall Street population is thinner than usual, and we’ve had no fresh news of any type, whether it’s on the geopolitical front or from the administration, that has materially impacted traders’ outlook,” said Bakhos. At 9:41 a.m. ET (1341 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 18.34 points, or 0.08 percent, at 21,832.01, the S&P; 500 was up 4.48 points, or 0.18 percent, at 2,447.53. The Nasdaq Composite was up 12.88 points, or 0.21 percent, at 6,278.52. Ten of the 11 major S&P; sectors were higher, with the health index’s 0.51 percent rise leading the advancers. Shares of Kite Pharmaceuticals soared 28.94 percent after Gilead Sciences agreed to buy the immunotherapy developer in an all-cash deal valued at $11.9 billion. Shares of Gilead gained 1.65 percent. The dollar index fell to as low as 92.372, its weakest since early May 2016, before recovering to trade down 0.34 percent at around 92.42. The currency has been under pressure since Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen stayed silent on monetary policy in a much-anticipated speech on Friday. Among stocks, Marathon Oil, Valero Energy were up about 2 percent. Oil majors Exxon inched up 0.13 percent and Chevron rose 0.22 percent. Insurers Travelers, Allstate and Progressive were all down more than 2 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,717 to 790. On the Nasdaq, 1,428 issues rose and 885 fell.

385,HD,"Harvey disrupts business, but some set to benefit","(Reuters) - Days before Hurricane Harvey barreled into the Texas coast on Friday, home improvement retailers were preparing truckloads of lumber, shingles and other materials that property owners in the storm-raked communities will need to rebuild. The deliveries will have to wait, however, as 56 stores between Home Depot and Lowe’s in southeast Texas remained closed as of Sunday amid widespread flooding. Once they reopen, the chains could be among the biggest beneficiaries of the post-storm recovery.  Lowe’s has sent “500 truckloads” of supplies to the storm zone, said spokeswoman Sarah Lively. “We are reopening those stores as quickly as possible.” For the moment, the biggest storm to hit Texas in 50 years is posing a major disruption to one of the most important economic crossroads in the United States and the heart of its oil industry. Ports, railways and highways are closed or clogged, potentially blocking movement of key parts of the U.S. manufacturing supply chain. Catastrophic flooding triggered by now Tropical Storm Harvey inundated Houston on Sunday, forcing residents of the fourth most populous U.S. city to flee their homes in anticipation of more days of “unprecedented” rainfall. The home improvement retailers, well versed in the business of disaster, are likely steps ahead of most companies.  At Home Depot, spokesman Matt Harrigan said preparations began “as soon as the storm was on the radar.”  Both Home Depot and Lowe’s said they have set up command centers to manage the response. Both companies also said they will freeze prices for lumber, roofing and other rebuilding materials for a time in the affected zone. Other U.S. companies, including automakers, railroads and insurers, will likely be trying to send investors similar reassuring messages as trading starts on Monday.  Texas is a significant vehicle market, particularly for highly profitable pickup trucks built by the big three Detroit automakers.  In the short term, the storm will hamper operations at dealers and could dampen August sales. But longer term, “it seems there has been enough flooding to damage thousands of light vehicles that will need replacing,” said Nick Colas, an independent analyst based in New York City.   For insurers, the storm could be a mixed blessing.  “Insurers - from a long term point of view they can raise their rates, but some insurers, if they have a particular geographic or sector concentration can get really beaten up,” said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co.   “Maybe the winners are the companies that have the least damage but the most license to increase their premiums.”  It was not clear on Sunday how the storm would affect supply chains for automakers and other manufacturers that depend on goods flowing to and from northern Mexico. Ford Motor Co, General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said on Sunday they had thus far not seen any impact or issues with getting parts across the storm zone but were monitoring the storm closely. The area of Mexico south of the storm zone is a major center for auto parts manufacturing.

Then, as Harvey gained power and made landfall late on Friday, the world’s largest home improvement retailer set up a temporary hurricane command center at its Atlanta headquarters. It told managers to freeze prices and move plywood, generators, chainsaws and other storm-related merchandise to the front of stores.  By Thursday, Home Depot had sent about 700 truckloads of supplies to its Texas stores in the path of the hurricane. As the streets began to flood over the weekend, the command center began ordering stores to shut down. But trucks still rolled out of a dedicated warehouse, stocked with hurricane defense and recovery products, located in Baytown, just 30 miles from downtown Houston.  In its response, Home Depot followed a plan honed over many hurricane seasons, which aims to minimize disruptions and ensure that it can continue to deliver essential materials and equipment to the affected areas. It is also designed to allow the retailer to capitalize on a surge in demand for its products once repairs begin. Before the hurricane season begins each summer, the retailer stocks everything from flashlights to shovels in dedicated centers. It pre-loads trucks so they can leave for stores as soon as a hurricane alert comes from a weather service. “As each natural disaster goes by, we hone our processes already in place so we can react quicker and faster the next time this happens,” said Pete Capel, a 26-year Home Depot veteran and merchandising executive in charge of the hurricane command center.  Moody’s Analytics estimates Harvey could cost southeast Texas $51 billion to $75 billion in losses, ranking it among the costliest storms in U.S. history. Private forecaster Planalytics on Monday said Harvey could cost retailers $1 billion in lost sales.  However, with planning and preparation, Home Depot, its rival Lowe’s Cos Inc, other home improvement retailers like Menards, Ace Hardware, True Value and their online counterparts like Wayfair Inc could see a sales boost. After Hurricane Sandy barreled into the New Jersey shoreline in late October of 2012, Home Depot attributed $242 million of fourth quarter sales to a boost in business arising from the repairs. Much depends on a quick response to big storms. By Saturday, up to 200 employees drafted from merchandising, logistics, supply chain and human resources teams were marshalling people and goods from Home Depot’s buzzing five-room command center filled with monitors tracking the storm and maps of the hurricane region pasted on walls. On Sunday, 80 employees arrived from Austin, the Texas state capital far from the danger zone, to stock stores in Corpus Christi, a coastal city hit by the storm. By Tuesday more workers from San Antonio were moving to Victoria, another affected city. At the Corpus Christi store, Home Depot workers placed pallets of bottled water, flashlights, gas cans and batteries near the cash registers.  One of those brought in, Bethany Grams, traveled 300 miles (483 km)from Waco, Texas, to work 12-hour shifts. “It’s been really heartening,” she said, brushing back tears. “It’s just good to get to help.” Along with the hardware sellers, railroads, trucking companies, logistics firms and others that make up the supply-chain of the economy also faced the challenge of providing essential goods to Texas, the second-largest U.S. state.[nL2N1LG1PG] Trucking company Old Dominion Freight Line Inc had around 2,000 shipments held up by Harvey and is refusing Houston-bound merchandise until after the roads clear, said David Bates, senior vice president of operations.  Before the storm hit, Old Dominion parked its tractor trailers in Corpus Christi to protect them against the wind, but it was the flooding that idled them. “We didn’t anticipate 10 to 20 feet of water in Houston,” Bates said. “You can’t anticipate that.” Home Depot said it was too early to compare the scale of this year’s operation with earlier efforts or to estimate how much Harvey would cost it. Burt Flickinger, managing director of retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group estimates it cost the retailer about $50 million to deal with hurricanes Rita and Katrina in 2005 and expects Harvey’s costs to top that. “They are a clear leader with disaster response and their strategic planning during such times is better than any retailer globally,” he said. While discount chains or department stores would bear the costs while missing out on revenue because of lost business, what Home Depot spent was an investment that would eventually bring “10 to 15 times more in sales,” Flickinger said. PLANNING FOR DISASTER    Home Depot’s storm plan shows how preparing for natural disasters has become over the years an inherent part of the retailers’ business. The company, with annual sales of $95 billion, first  identified hurricane response as a strategic need after Hurricane Andrew, 25 years ago. It has refined its tactics since. Just over a decade ago, it established four distribution centers with hurricane-specific goods within easy reach of hurricane-prone coastal areas - in Baytown, Texas; Lakeland, Florida; Cranbury, New Jersey; and one near company headquarters in Atlanta. For Harvey, Home Depot used Baytown, a warehouse in Dallas and one in Winchester, Virginia. Texas contributes about 10 percent to Home Depot’s revenue, according to research firm Global Data. Thanks to upgraded inventory tracking technology, store managers now know when to expect emergency shipments. Such precise information was not yet at hand at the time Hurricane Sandy struck almost five years ago. Now it helps retailers to limit losses by re-opening stores as fast as possible. Out of the 48 stores Home Depot had to shut, six remained closed as of Thursday morning. Ensuring timely deliveries to the rest is a challenge and retailers are counting on vendors to help out.   West Fraser, a supplier of lumber to Home Depot, said it was trying to make sure deliveries to its customers were as regular as possible. Other suppliers, such as Weyerhaeuser Co, USG Corp, Jeld-Wen Holding Inc and Masonite Corp did not respond to requests for comment. By Tuesday, Home Depot had lined up shipments ready to go into Houston, Capel said. As of Thursday, some of those shipments had started to make their way in. Lowe’s, which has its own disaster-response strategy, had closed 27 stores as of Monday, but by Wednesday had opened all but four. Workers were restocking, pushing to have all stores open in the next few days, said Rick Neudorff, the retailer’s emergency command center operations manager.  By Tuesday, Lowe’s has dispatched 700 trucks from warehouses around the country that can get goods to Texas in two days or less, diverting many directly to stores rather than distribution centers. Lowe’s also is asking vendors to ship directly to stores, Neudorff told Reuters.  “Some stores are practically selling generators off the back of the truck because people have been waiting in the stores for the generators to arrive,” he said.

391,HD,"Fitch Rates The Home Depot, Inc.'s Proposed Sr. Unsecured Notes 'A'","(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to The Home Depot, Inc.'s proposed issuance of senior unsecured notes, which Fitch expects could be for up to $1 billion. The proceeds from the issue will be used for repayment of $500 million of maturing debt and general corporate purposes, including share repurchases. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating reflects Home Depot's strong track record of comparable store sales (comps) growth, margin expansion and cash flow generation. Fitch expects the company will maintain leverage (adjusted debt/EBITDAR) in line with its publicly stated target of 2x over the forecast horizon. With $95 billion in 2016 sales, Home Depot holds the leading position in the U.S. home improvement industry, which is in the midst of a recovery from the prior housing recession. Fitch's rating anticipates a continued recovery as well as a benign competitive environment. However, should the housing recovery stall, Fitch believes Home Depot has the willingness and ability to use its cash flow generation to maintain its leverage commitments. Solid Track Record: Home Depot has grown comps and EBITDA margin every year since 2010, with 5% average annual comps and EBITDA improvement of over 600bps from 2009 to 16.6% in 2016. Operating momentum has been supported by improvement in home improvement industry fundamentals, especially in regard to repair and maintenance projects. Home improvement retailers have further benefited from benign industry square-footage growth (including very modest unit expansion from Home Depot and chief competitor Lowes) and competitive resilience to the discount and online channels. Success in the home improvement industry requires significant investments in inventory breadth and customer service, and discounters generally focus on categories with narrow assortment needs and limited customer service. Online competition, meanwhile, has been limited due to short purchase windows and the bulky/heavy nature of home improvement inventory (we note that nearly half of Home Depot's existing online sales involve in-store merchandise pickup). Continued Growth Expected: Fitch anticipates continued sales and EBITDA growth over the forecast horizon, predicated on a continued U.S. housing market recovery and Home Depot's focus on its strategic pillars of customer service; product leadership; capital allocation; and interconnected retail. The company's growth initiatives are designed to leverage Home Depot's existing scale to broaden its customer base and share of wallet. For example, the 2015 acquisition of Interline Brands gives Home Depot access to the underpenetrated residential facility maintenance and repair market. Meanwhile, Home Depot is using its online infrastructure to expand product assortment and offer customers increased product knowledge, while promoting its in-store pickup capability. Fitch believes successful execution of its initiatives, coupled with industry tailwinds, will allow Home Depot to generate 2%-4% annual comps and revenue growth over time. EBITDA margins are expected to remain around 17%, though Home Depot could leverage fixed expenses at the high end of its comps range. Modest annual EBITDA growth is projected to yield annual free cash flow (FCF) of $4 billion-$4.5 billion after dividends of $4.5 billion-$5 billion. Disciplined Capital Allocation: Home Depot's scale and stable growth have allowed it to comfortably manage to its adjusted leverage target of 2.0x for several years (1.9x at year-end 2016). To the extent EBITDA continues to grow over the next two to three years, Fitch expects Home Depot to issue debt to maintain leverage within its target. Excess cash flow, including proceeds from debt issuance, is expected to be used to support the company's dividend and share repurchase program. Given Home Depot's leverage commitment, Fitch believes management could pull back on share repurchase to maintain or reduce debt levels should economic or operating headwinds limit EBITDA growth. DERIVATION SUMMARY Home Depot's 'A'/Stable rating reflects its leading position in the U.S. home improvement industry, its substantial cash flow and commitment to its financial policy. The home improvement industry has been shown to be resilient to discount and online competition but is highly cyclical, in line with the housing market. At $95 billion in 2016 sales, Home Depot is significantly larger than closest peer Lowes Companies ($65 billion) and has a modestly lower leverage profile. AutoZone Inc. (BBB/Stable) is a market leader in the U.S. autoparts retail industry, which has similarly benign competitive characteristics as home improvement and has limited economic cyclicality, but is much smaller than Home Depot. Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBB-/Stable) is a market leader in the competitively and secularly challenged consumer electronics industry. Finally, The Kroger Co. (BBB/Stable) is a leader in the highly competitive, though not cyclical, grocery space. Each of these retailers has a more aggressive financial policy than does Home Depot and therefore a higher leverage profile. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Fitch expects Home Depot to produce comps in the 3%-4% range over the next two years, supported by a continued recovery in the housing market and the company's strategic investments; --EBITDA margin is expected to remain close to 17%, yielding approximately 3%-4% EBITDA growth; --Fitch expects $4 billion-$4.5 billion of annual FCF after dividends going forward; --Fitch expects FCF and some incremental borrowings to be directed to share repurchases as the company manages to its adjusted leverage target of 2x. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action Continued positive operating trends together with a sustained reduction in adjusted leverage to below 1.5x could lead to a positive rating action. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action Weaker operating trends or a move by management to more shareholder-friendly policies that cause adjusted leverage to increase to the low 2x range on a sustained basis could lead to a negative rating action. LIQUIDITY Home Depot has a strong liquidity position supported by a cash balance of $4.8 billion at July 30, 2017, together with an undrawn $2 billion credit facility. The company also benefits from owning 90% of its stores. Home Depot is maintaining a very slow pace of new-store expansion, with plans to build only six new stores in 2017. Low levels of capital expenditure (less than 2% of sales) have resulted in strong FCF after dividends, which are expected to total more than $4 billion annually going forward. Fitch expects Home Depot would remain FCF positive in an economic downturn, as it did through the last recession. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Home Depot as follows: The Home Depot Inc. --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A'; --Senior unsecured notes 'A'; --Bank credit facilities 'A'; --Short-Term IDR 'F1'; --Commercial paper 'F1'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

393,HD,"UPDATE 1-Home Depot, Lowe's ship emergency material to Florida ahead of hurricane","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Home improvement retailers Home Depot Inc and Lowe’s Inc said on Wednesday they have started shipping emergency material to Florida in anticipation of Hurricane Irma, even as they continue recovery efforts after Hurricane Harvey in Texas. Irma, which hit the Caribbean island of St. Martin on Wednesday, is expected to make landfall in Florida during the weekend but its precise trajectory remained uncertain. Irma could become the second powerful storm to thrash the U.S. mainland after Harvey killed more than 60 people and caused as much as $180 billion in damage after hitting Texas late last month. “This is unusual because we are now juggling two different storms in two different phases. One is approaching while the other market is in the recovery phase,” Home Depot spokesman Matthew Harrigan told Reuters. Home Depot is following the “same script” preparing for Irma as it did for Harvey. The retailer’s merchandising and supply chain teams have previously dealt with different weather-related disasters at once, Harrigan said without giving specific examples. Before Harvey hit Texas, the world’s largest hardware and home improvement chain activated its disaster-response plan, asked managers to freeze prices in stores around the region and move storm related merchandise to the front of the store. It followed a plan honed over many hurricane seasons to minimize disruptions, deliver essential material to affected areas and capitalize on a surge in demand for products once repairs begin. Home Depot said it takes up to two months to open stores that are hit hard by a hurricane. Stores that are minimally impacted are usually opened within a few days. Both Home Depot and Lowe’s had activated a hurricane command center during Harvey that is now continuing to monitor the path of Irma and mobilizing resources such as supplies. Home Depot said it has despatched 300 truckloads to Florida so far. Rival Lowe’s said it has sent 400 truckloads of hurricane prep material including flashlights, batteries and weather radios to Florida. Analysts have said investments in logistics and supply chain by home improvement chains during a weather-related disaster typically brings about 10 to 15 times more in sales. Shares of both Home Depot and Lowe’s traded up nearly 2 percent on Wednesday morning.

394,HD,"Harvey, Irma to hit US apparel retailers more than restaurants","(Reuters) - Industry-wide retail sales in August and September will fall in the wake of hurricanes Harvey and Irma, with apparel retailers such as Gap Inc (GPS.N) expected to take a longer-term hit than restaurant operators including Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O). U.S. same-store sales at apparel chains are expected to rise just 0.1 percent in the third quarter ending October, compared with a 0.6 percent increase seen before the hurricanes, according to Thomson Reuters data.   The two high-intensity hurricanes, which made landfall in the U.S. over the past two weeks, have killed dozens and damaged thousands of homes in Texas and Florida.    As residents in these states begin to rebuild houses, home improvement chains including Home Depot Inc (HD.N) are well positioned to benefit. But some retailers are not as fortunate. Dunkin’ Donuts (DNKN.O) could lose some $17 million in sales if all its stores in the storm-ravaged states of Florida and Texas are shut for a week, according to Cowen & Co. That would amount to a little more than 10 percent of the chain’s quarterly U.S. sales. Bojangles Inc (BOJA.O), known for its Southern-styled recipes, could see a big drop in sales, according to Canaccord Genuity analyst Lynne Collier. More than 80 percent of the company’s restaurants are in the storm-hit areas. In contrast, Starbucks, with about 3 percent store exposure to Texas and 5.6 percent to Florida, could lose about $35 million in sales per week if all stores in those states were closed, Cowen said. That is less than 1 percent of the company’s quarterly sales. Overall, Hurricane Harvey had a muted 40 basis point negative impact on industry same-restaurant sales in August, according to data research firm MillerPulse.  Supply chains are expected to be disrupted across the board, which could lead to delays in delivery of holiday inventories for some retailers, Cowen & Co analyst Oliver Chen said. The worst hit by the delays are likely to be apparel retailers such as Gap Inc (GPS.N) and J. Jill (JILL.N).  “Retailers that sell items which customers need, such as food and water and home improvement items, are better positioned versus retailers that sell discretionary fashion,” Chen wrote in a note. The hurricanes are expected to have a “modestly negative” impact on Wal-Mart (WMT.N) and dollar stores including Dollar General (DG.N) as demand for food, batteries and water before and after the hurricanes offsets losses from store closures, Gordon Haskett analyst Charles Grom said. Same-store sales at Home Depot and Lowe’s are expected to rise 3.5 percent to 4 percent in the second-half of the year, Morgan Stanley analyst Simeon Gutman said in a note.

396,HD,Home Depot lifts full-year forecasts as hurricanes spur demand,"(Reuters) - Home Depot Inc (HD.N), the largest U.S. home improvement chain,  on Tuesday raised its full-year profit and sales forecast after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma spurred demand for generators, flashlights and rebuilding materials. The Dow component, which is riding a multi-year recovery in the housing market, got a huge boost in the quarter as the hurricanes drove customers to its stores in the southern United States for emergency supplies. Home Depot’s shares, up 23 percent this year, were marginally lower at $165.30 in morning trading.  Despite the spike in sales in the latest quarter, investors remain concerned about when the U.S. housing recovery might lose momentum. Home Depot’s chief financial officer addressed those concerns on a post-earnings conference call. “As we think about housing broadly and fears of slowdown, we don’t see that for 2018, 2019 and 2020,” said Carol Tomé, citing the stock of older homes and rising prices. A shortage of skilled labor is weighing on the supply of homes and pushing up costs, with U.S. house prices increasing for the seventh straight year. Home Depot’s net sales rose 8 percent to $25.03 billion in the third quarter, helped by a 5 percent jump in average receipt and a 2.5 percent rise in transactions. Sales of big-ticket items, which are priced above $900 and accounted for over a fifth of total sales, rose 12 percent.  Demand for appliances, vinyl plank flooring and products such as lumber and hand tools, bought by the company’s contractor-customers, drove the jump in big-ticket sales. The company posted double-digit rise in comparable sales of hurricane-related merchandise, including generators, wet-dry vacuum cleaners and tarps. Hurricane-related sales added about $282 million to comparable sales in the quarter, the company said.   Home Depot had recorded $377 million in sales of storm-recovery merchandise in 2012 after Hurricanes Irene and Sandy.      Comparable sales at U.S. stores increased 7.7 percent in the third quarter, beating estimates of 6 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Home Depot said it now expects sales to grow 6.3 percent, comparable sales to increase 6.5 percent and a profit of $7.36 per share for the year ending January 2018.  Net income rose 10 percent to $2.17 billion, or $1.84 per share, in the three months ended Oct. 29.     The company earned $1.87 per share, excluding hurricanes-related items, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.82 per share and revenue of $24.55 billion.

The retailer’s shares fell 1.4 percent to $180.22 on the New York Stock Exchange as its latest buyback target pointed to a slowdown in the pace of repurchases. The largest U.S. home improvement store chain said it expects to buy back $12.5 billion over the next three years, compared with the $8 billion it plans to buy for the year ending January 2018. It plans to buy $2.1 billion of shares in the current quarter. Home Depot is riding a multi-year recovery in the U.S. housing market and has benefited from reconstruction and repair work after Hurricanes Irma and Harvey struck the United States in August and September.  But it also must contend with growing competition from online and brick-and-mortar rivals, so it plans to speed up investment in its in stores, employees, deliveries and online business. “The retail landscape is changing at unprecedented rates and we plan to invest for the future to address the evolving needs of our customers,” Chief Executive Officer Craig Menear said in a statement. The Atlanta-based company said it would invest in making check-out faster for customers as well as wages and scheduling for employees. It would also change its merchandise more frequently and make it easier for customers to navigate its giant stores by adding digital signs.   The company is doubling its total investment spending over three years, which puts a limit on its profitability expansion and the shares it can buy back, which could be weighing on investor appetite for the stock today, Edward Jones analyst Robin Diedrich said. The company on its investor day call sought to allay concerns about limits on deductions for mortgage interest proposed under the Republican U.S. tax overhaul, a factor that may curb the appetite for new homes.

The U.S. housing market has been on a winning streak, helped by rising employment and higher wages. That has encouraged homeowners to buy new homes or remodel existing ones, benefiting Home Depot and smaller rival Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N). “The U.S. economy is strong and tax reform is net positive for the housing industry,” Chief Financial Officer Carol Tome said on an earnings call. “We expect higher job growth, higher income growth, and higher mortgage rates. But with that comes higher home price appreciation and rising housing demand, which should drive home improvement spending,” she said. However, Home Depot’s comparable store sales growth forecast for its current fiscal year was shy of analysts’ estimates. But that did not deter Wall Street’s expectations. “The outlook will prove conservative given continued momentum in housing and the company’s ability to execute,” Telsey Advisory Group analyst Joseph Feldman said. Home Depot’s results are in contrast to that of Walmart Inc (WMT.N), which on Tuesday reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit and posted a sharp drop in online sales growth during the holiday period.

420,HD,UPDATE 5-Lowe's struggles as investments hit margins,"(Reuters) - Lowe’s Companies Inc’s (LOW.N) quarterly profit and margins fell well short of Wall Street estimates on Wednesday as the No. 2 U.S. home improvement chain’s investments to convert shoppers’ visits into sales did not pay off as much as expected. The company’s shares tumbled 9 percent after Lowe’s forecast a drop in margins this year - due to heavy investment in a very competitive U.S. market.  A forecast that same-store sales growth would also slow this year suggested that investment would not bear fruit soon and left it trailing sector leader Home Depot. “We made an investment in the third quarter to bolster conversion rates ... we need to make the incremental investments to ensure that we convert that traffic into transactions,” Chief Executive Officer Robert Niblock said on a conference call. Despite a rise in store traffic, the number of customers making purchases dropped, and the purchases included expensive items with lower profit margins, such as lumber and washing machines. For investors, the benefit of higher same store sales were undermined by lower profit margins.  “Big ticket sales continued to be a driver of much of the top-line gains, with appliances coming at a double-digit pace and tickets over $500 rising at 5.5 percent,” Morningstar analyst Jamie Katz said.  “However, appliances tend to have lower gross margin than some other categories at the business, adding pressure to profitability.” The company’s gross margins fell to 33.73 percent, missing analysts estimates of 34.27 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company attributed sales of lower-margin products as well as money spent on initiatives such as advertising and home deliveries for the drop.  Operating margins also dropped and Lowe’s said it expected a drop of about 30 basis points this year. Same-store sales, however, rose 4.1 percent, topping market expectations. But that was well below the 7-percent growth posted by market-leader Home Depot Inc (HD.N), which also reported higher customer transactions and average spend. Lowe’s net sales fell nearly 2 percent to $15.49 billion, but topped estimates of $15.33 billion. Net income fell 12.5 percent to $554 million. Its adjusted earnings of 74 cents per share were well below analysts’ estimate of 87 cents. The results from the home improvement chain, which also owns Canadian home goods retailer Rona, come at a time when rising mortgage rates and the impact of the U.S. tax reforms on higher-priced homes have begun to worry investors in construction-related businesses. Lowe’s shares were down 6.3 percent at $89.81 in mid-day trading, easing from a session-low of $86.75. Both Lowe’s and Home Depot’s shares have risen about 28 percent in the past year.

421,HD,"Home Depot in $27.84 mln Calif. hazardous waste, privacy settlement","(Reuters) - Home Depot Inc agreed to pay $27.84 million to settle charges by California’s attorney general that it illegally disposed of hazardous waste in that state and threw out customer records without first rendering personal information unreadable. The attorney general, Xavier Becerra, on Thursday said the largest U.S. home improvement retailer will pay $16.64 million in civil penalties, $9.35 million toward environmental protection and compliance, and $1.85 million to cover costs. California said Home Depot stores and facilities failed to properly manage the disposal of aerosol cans, batteries, electronics, paint and other items, as well as customer information. It said this gave Home Depot an unfair advantage over rivals that complied with state hazardous waste control and unfair competition laws. Becerra said the accord followed 2-1/2 years of inspections of Home Depot trash dumpsters, which uncovered the violations. Home Depot also agreed to a permanent injunction against similar violations. The $27.84 million payment represents a little over one day of profit for the Atlanta-based retailer.  “We’re pleased to have settled this and we remain committed to the responsible disposal of waste,” Home Depot said in a  statement. “We’ll continue to work with California officials to that end.” ",3082018,http://www.reuters.com/article/home-depot-california/home-depot-in-27-84-mln-calif-hazardous-waste-privacy-settlement-idUSL2N1QQ1UP

423,HD,Lawsuit saying Home Depot tricks buyers of 4X4 lumber is deep-sixed,"(Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday dismissed a lawsuit accusing Home Depot Inc of deceiving shoppers about the size of its four-by-four lumber. U.S. District Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman in Chicago rejected plaintiff Mikhail Abramov’s claim that the largest U.S. home improvement retailer should be held liable for selling lumber as 4 inches thick by 4 inches wide, when the dimensions were actually 3-1/2 inches by 3-1/2 inches. While not persuaded by Atlanta-based Home Depot that the lumber’s actual size was “common knowledge,” Coleman said its labels reading “4X4-6’” would not have misled reasonable consumers. She said the “4x4” portion lacked any unit of measurement, and Home Depot never expressly represented that its lumber actually measured 4 inches by 4 inches. Abramov’s allegations “describe no more than a label that was potentially confusing to some consumers,” Coleman wrote. The dismissal was without prejudice, meaning Abramov can refile his proposed class-action complaint, which sought unspecified damages. His lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Home Depot spokesman Stephen Holmes said on Monday: “We’re glad to have resolved the issue.” In seeking a dismissal, Home Depot said a ruling for Abramov would “ignore nearly a century of standardization and disturb an entire industry’s reliance on these lumber names.” U.S. District Judge Edmond Chang, who also sits in Chicago, in September dismissed a similar lawsuit filed by Abramov’s law firm against home improvement retailer Menards. Chang, however, found that “no reasonable consumer would think that the labels showed the exact dimensions of the lumber.” His decision has been appealed.

425,HD,Toolbox trade wars: How a sure winner in U.S. dispute has yet to reap benefits," FRANKLIN PARK, Ill. (Reuters) - Nestled in an industrial park near the end of the runway of O’Hare International Airport, Metal Box International Inc. should be one of the winners of a little-known trade war over toolboxes. In January, the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled Chinese imports had harmed domestic producers of big tool chests sold in retail stores, prompting the Trump administration to slap anti-subsidy duties of up to 95 percent on Chinese boxes. That could jump far higher later this year, after the administration decides whether to add anti-dumping duties on top of the anti-subsidy charges. “This is a game changer for us,” said Mitch Liss, one of the owners of the privately held company, who said regaining just a small slice of the Chinese business would make the factory boom. Metal Box International is one of only two remaining U.S. producers of such boxes. The other is Waterloo Industries, a far larger company recently acquired by Stanley Black & Decker Inc, the global tool producer. So if retailers were going to start buying American again to avoid the mounting duties, it would almost certainly be visible at this factory. It hasn’t worked out that way. There was a small uptick after the January ruling, Liss said, but so far no boom in orders. After spending $300,000 on new equipment in a surge of optimism, he put plans to buy additional machines on hold and has not added any new workers. Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s move last week to crack down on steel and aluminum imports is threatening to boost costs for Metal Box International as well as Stanley Black & Decker, which uses those metals to fashion similar tool chests. Stanley Black & Decker declined to talk about whether it was seeing any impact on its business from the new toolbox duties, though a spokesman told Reuters the International Trade Commission’s decision could mean “increased volume in the plant, which can translate into growth in U.S. manufacturing jobs.” A spokesman for Home Depot said he would not discuss the company’s tool chest sourcing “for competitive reasons.” The current battle over steel and aluminum tariffs underscores the risks and complexity in trade disputes, which often pit America’s love of cheap imports against its desire to protect blue-collar jobs. Winners and losers aren’t always initially clear. Tariffs on steel and aluminum could help some U.S. workers - United States Steel Corp cited the prospect of tariffs this week as its reason to restart a mill in Illinois, for instance. For a graphic, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2Fc94hU But as a consumer of steel, Liss said the metal tariffs will hurt him but quickly adds that he understands why industries are looking for protection from cheaper imports. Metal Box International had a strong business in tool chests as recently as 2014, when among other models it sold a design to Home Depot with glass on the fronts of the drawers - which made it easier to see which tools were in each compartment. Those were a big seller. But the business quickly faded, he said, as they were displaced by imports that sold to retailers at lower prices than Metal Box International could match. Shipments of boxes fell by half in 2015 and fell again by half in 2016, said Liss. The company was planning to shut down when Liss heard that his last U.S. competitor, then called Waterloo Industries, was planning to file a trade case. Waterloo coordinated its efforts with Liss, who traveled to Washington to testify against the importers. The trade case targeted only a slice of the toolbox industry. Small, portable toolboxes were excluded, as were professional-type toolboxes sold by companies such as Snap-On Inc, which market directly to buyers. Companies have long sought trade protection in Washington, often finding as much success under Republicans as Democrats. The trade dispute process is meant to be bi-partisan, with an equal number of Democrats and Republicans sitting on the International Trade Commission. But the climate now has shifted decisively in the favor of protection under Trump, especially for old-line industries like steel. The Commerce Department said it launched 82 new investigations into trade cases last year, a 58 percent jump over the year before. “There is the potential element of companies knowing that they’re dealing with a more sympathetic administration,” which may be prompting more complaints, said Scott Lincicome, a trade expert at the free-market oriented Cato Institute. The Department of Commerce can do subtle things to help companies succeed in these cases, he noted, like offering better guidance in how to draft complaints. But Lincicome said the number of trade cases were already on the rise before the last election. These things always tend to “come in waves,” he added. The Metal Box International plant, which employs about 100 people, was building Husky brand tool chests for Home Depot one recent day, with workers clustered around an assembly line inserting drawers into the boxes as they rumbled down the line. The metal-bending machines Liss bought are already lined up in the middle of the plant, but not yet operational. Ever thrifty, Liss bought the machines from a company that reconditions equipment, rather than splurging on new. “I bought these for $75,000,” he said. “New, each would cost $250,000.” Liss said most workers here are unaware how close the plant came to shutting down or how tenuous the situation remains. And even those who do know, like the director of operations Tom St. Germain, tend not to talk about the political atmosphere that seems to be helping U.S. producers like them. Germain said he likes President Trump, but added that “if he shut his mouth and did his job, he’d be more successful.” Liss calls St. Germain almost every day to check whether big orders are rolling in. These are early days, Liss said, so it still might happen. Retailers may have already stocked up on imports as they anticipated the trade ruling in favor of the domestic producers. But this would normally be a busier time, since Father’s Day - along with Black Friday and Christmas - are the highpoints of their annual selling cycle. Still, each week that passes without a surge of orders adds to his worry and confusion. At the moment, he says “we’re back to being a little stressed out.” ",3122018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-effect-toolbox/toolbox-trade-wars-how-a-sure-winner-in-u-s-dispute-has-yet-to-reap-benefits-idUSKCN1GO0CE
426,HD,"Home improvement chain Lowe's CEO to retire, shares rise","(Reuters) - Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) on Monday said its chief executive officer is retiring, the latest executive departure as the home improvement chain tries to move out of the shadow of larger rival Home Depot Inc (HD.N) that has outperformed it for years. Shares of Lowe’s rose as much as 7.8 percent to $90.33  after Robert Niblock said he would step down once a successor was found. The No. 2 U.S. home improvement store has struggled to control margin pressures and its same-store sales growth has trailed Home Depot’s for many years, weighed down by a focus on do-it-yourself customers compared to Home Depot’s core customer base of professional contractors who bill more. Lowe’s underperformance has also attracted shareholder activism.  Hedge fund D.E. Shaw Group secured two independent board seats after taking a nearly $1 billion stake and agitating for change. D.E. Shaw, best known as a quantitative hedge fund, started carving out an activist practice last year.  D.E. Shaw portfolio manager Quentin Koffey said in a statement that Niblock leaves the company in “excellent condition” to execute on value creation opportunities. In the past year, Lowe’s stock gained 1.7 percent, in contrast to Home Depot’s near 17 percent rise.    Telsey Advisory Group analyst Joseph Feldman said, “a transition will be well received by investors, given their pent-up frustration with the company, and could be the first step toward improved operational execution.” Niblock’s departure follows the retirements of Chief Financial Officer Robert Hull and Chief Operating Officer Rick Damron over the past year. Lowe’s said its board has formed a six-person committee to find a successor, led by D.E. Shaw-backed director David Batchelder. “After a 25-year career at Lowe’s ... I am confident that it is the right time to transition the company to its next generation of leadership,” Niblock, who is also the chairman and president of the board, said in a statement.         Since Niblock took the top job at Lowe’s in January 2005, the company’s sales have risen 88 percent to $68.62 billion, while the stock has gained more than threefold.
