1,MRK,Pfizer to unload units worth over $16 billion,"NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) might sell or spin off its animal health and nutrition units — businesses valued at more than $16 billion — to focus on its main pharmaceutical business and cushion the loss of its top-selling Lipitor cholesterol drug.  The drugmaker, the world’s biggest, also said on Thursday it will hold on to its established-products unit, which sells generic drugs, and its consumer healthcare business, bringing resolution to a review of its portfolio under Chief Executive Ian Read, a company veteran who took the helm in December.  Pfizer shares were down 1.9 percent in afternoon trading. They had risen some 19 percent this year, partly due to expectations of asset sales. Some investors were disappointed the company did not announce plans to sell off even more divisions, Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said.  “People wanted the established products and consumer groups to be included,” Conover said.  Animal health and nutrition, which accounted for about 8 percent of the company’s 2010 revenue, are “distinct enough from our core businesses that their value may be best maximized outside the company,” Read said in a statement.  The drugmaker also has been looking to cut costs to counter huge pressure on its revenue when it loses U.S. exclusivity for Lipitor in November.  Les Funtleyder, a portfolio manager with Miller Tabak who holds Pfizer shares, said it is possible the company will use the money to buy back stock, although ultimately it needs to develop new drugs.  “If you don’t do it right you’re just throwing money out the door,” Funtleyder said of research and development spending. “In a perfect world they would take the money and put it into developing new drugs.”  Pfizer has struggled to bring significant new products to market from its own research efforts. But earlier this year, it said it would slash as much as $2 billion from its 2012 research budget to help it meet profit goals.  In an interview with Reuters earlier this week, former Pfizer research chief John LaMattina said the drugmaker would be spending a low percentage of its revenue on R&D.  Even without the animal health and nutritionals businesses, Pfizer would be on track to spend at most 12 percent of revenue on research — below the historical 15 percent to 20 percent cited by LaMattina for the industry.  SPIN-OFF OR SALE FOR ANIMAL HEALTH?  While some investors are eager to see Pfizer slim down, exiting animal health means leaving behind a business that rival drugmakers are turning to as a driver of future profits.  Pfizer’s animal health business develops products for livestock and pets, and operates in more than 60 countries. It posted revenue of about $3.6 billion last year, making it one of the world’s largest in the field. Analysts put the value of the business at $10 billion to $16 billion.  Analysts said Pfizer might encounter antitrust problems should it seek to sell the animal health unit to some rivals. Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) and Sanofi SA (SASY.PA) earlier this year abandoned plans for an animal health joint venture with $5 billion in annual sales because of antitrust issues.  Conover said Eli Lilly & Co (LLY.N) — which won European approval on Thursday to buy Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) animal health unit — and Novartis AG NOVN.VX could be buyers of the Pfizer business, saying they were examples of “tier two players who may want to become tier one players.”  Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said he would expect Pfizer to spin off the animal health business in a tax-free transaction, similar to what Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) did with its Mead Johnson Nutrition Co MJN.N business.  Pfizer’s nutrition business, which sells formula and other nutritional products for infants and children up to 7 years old, generated revenue of about $1.9 billion last year. Analysts put the value of the nutritionals unit at $6 billion to $7.5 billion.  Potential buyers could include Mead Johnson, Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), Danone SA (DANO.PA) and Nestle NESN.VX, Conover said.  Pfizer said it expects to complete any transactions in 12 months to 24 months and does not expect to make any further announcements about the businesses until next year.  JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) is advising Pfizer on a possible deal for the animal health business, while Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Centerview Partners are advising on the nutrition business.  In explaining its decision to keep the established products business, Pfizer said generic drugs and other off-patent medicines are crucial to growth in emerging markets.  The company said one important benefit of the consumer healthcare business is that it can extend the value of products by enabling Pfizer to market them when they switch from prescription to nonprescription medicines.

2,MRK,Merck settles with Teva over cholesterol drugs," * Teva to hold off on generic copies until April 25, 2017   * Agreement settles lawsuits brought by Merck   LOS ANGELES, July 8 (Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA) settled a lawsuit brought by Merck & Co (MRK.N) by agreeing to hold off until 2017 on sales of generic versions of cholesterol drugs Vytorin and Zetia, according to court documents.   The agreement, filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey on Thursday, settles lawsuits filed by Merck.   Vytorin, which posted 2010 sales of $2 billion, combines Merck’s older statin Zocor, or simvastatin, with the newer cholesterol-fighter Zetia, or ezetimibe, which had sales last year of $2.3 billion.

The sell-off was broad and halted an eight-day streak for the Nasdaq, though stocks ended off their lows.

5,MRK,FDA proposes targeted drug testing guidelines,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Targeted drugs or therapies up for U.S. regulatory approval would have to be reviewed simultaneously with the diagnostic devices they rely on, according to a proposed policy issued on Tuesday.  So-called targeted treatments or personalized medicines are tailored to a person’s genetic makeup and are being increasingly developed by drug companies.  The Food and Drug Administration proposed rules saying these personalized treatments would gain approval only after their accompanying diagnostic devices also receive approval — unless the treatment is for a serious or life-threatening condition.  Diagnostic tests, known as companion diagnostics, improve the effectiveness of targeted treatments by determining if a patient is a genetic fit with a therapy. They can help doctors identify which patients are most likely to benefit from a new drug, or experience debilitating side effects, and help save enormous cost by eliminating people who would not be helped.  Pfizer’s experimental drug crizotinib, for example, is designed to target a specific genetic mutation prevalent in nonsmokers with non-small cell lung cancer. Crizotinib, which is being reviewed on a priority basis by U.S. regulators, has a companion test developed by Abbott Laboratories, which partnered with Pfizer about two years ago.  The FDA’s proposed rules outlined only two exceptions when a new targeted drug or therapy could receive approval without FDA also approving its companion diagnostic.  One is for new treatments of serious or life-threatening conditions that have no other satisfactory treatments and only if the new treatment shows “pronounced” benefits that outweigh the risks. The second is for labeling changes to already-approved therapies to address safety concerns.  The FDA is now seeking public comment on the proposal.

7,MRK,Gilead kickstarts patent pool for AIDS drugs,"LONDON (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences, the leading maker of HIV drugs, is to share intellectual property rights on its medicines in a patent pool designed to make treatments more widely available to the poor.  The California-based group is the first drugmaker to sign up to the new Medicines Patent Pool, whose organizers now expect other major pharmaceutical manufacturers to join the initiative.  Ellen ‘t Hoen, the pool’s executive director, told Reuters she was negotiating terms for similar deals with ViiV Healthcare — a GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer joint venture — as well as with Bristol-Myers Squibb, Roche, Boehringer Ingelheim and Sequoia Pharmaceuticals.  “This is not just a one-off. The whole field is changing ... there will be more to follow,” she said.  Around 33 million people worldwide have the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS. Most live in Africa and Asia, where medicines have to be very cheap to allow those who need them to be able to afford them.  The Medicines Patent Pool, launched by the UNITAID health financing system that is funded by a tax on airline tickets, aims to address this problem by creating a system for patent holders to license technology to makers of cheap generics in exchange for modest royalties.  In the case of Gilead, the agreement allows for the production of generic copies of tenofovir, emtricitabine, cobicistat and elvitegravir, as well as a combination of these products in a single HIV pill known as the “Quad.”  Significantly, cobicistat, elvitegravir and the Quad are still in clinical development, and their inclusion in the deal should speed the flow of new treatments in poor countries.  “Through systematic licensing of intellectual property related to HIV products, people in developing countries will have access to low-cost versions of those products almost at the same time that people in rich countries do,” ‘t Hoen said.  Traditionally, patients in developing countries have to wait for years before they can get access to new drugs.  Gilead will receive a 3 percent royalty on generic sales of tenofovir, which is also approved for use in hepatitis B, and 5 percent on the other products.  The licenses will allow for the supply of tenofovir and emtricitabine in 111 countries, for cobicistat in 102 countries, and for elvitegravir and the Quad in 99 countries.  Assuming other companies come on board, the patent pool could save poor countries more than $1 billion a year in drug costs.  But the revenue stream to Gilead and other patent holders is likely to be small, since generic drug prices in Africa could be just 1 or 2 percent of those in high-income countries.  The decision by Gilead and others to work with UNITAID on the new patent pool marks an evolution in thinking by Big Pharma toward the thorny problem of drug access in the developing world.  Ten years ago, the world’s pharmaceutical industry took a very different stance when it sued South Africa over legislation that was passed by former President Nelson Mandela and which favored generics.  That battle proved a public relations disaster, and since then individual companies have struck a series of voluntary licensing deals, allowing generic copies of HIV products on a case-by-case basis.  The patent pool system, however, goes beyond this by providing an effective “one-stop shop” for generic firms to secure rights to manufacture patent-protected drugs.  The U.S. National Institutes of Health became the first organization to sign up to the pool last September. The concept has been harder for some drugmakers to swallow.  ViiV, for example, was initially unwilling to consider pooling its patents — and Abbott Laboratories, Merck & Co and Johnson & Johnson have yet to enter formal negotiations, although ‘t Hoen said her team was now discussing the idea with all three companies.

10,MRK,Novartis has no need to buy Intercell-source," * Novartis has been seen as buyer for Intercell   * Intercell open to sale after several product setbacks   * Novartis declines to comment   By Katie Reid and Angelika Gruber   ZURICH/VIENNA, July 18 (Reuters) - Novartis NOVN.VX has no need or plans to acquire Intercell ICEL.VI, Europe’s last independent vaccine maker, a source familiar with Novartis’ thinking said.   Novartis currently owns a 15 percent stake in the Austrian biotech group and speculation has swirled that the Swiss drugmaker could buy Intercell, which has said it is open to being acquired after a string of product setbacks over the past year.   “Why would Novartis buy Intercell when it already has access to the pipeline? Novartis does not have any worries about its own vaccine pipeline and is not eager to pursue a transaction,” a source familiar with the company’s thinking told Reuters.   Loss-making Intercell has recently appointed a new chief executive and is looking to slash costs by more than 50 percent as part of a strategy review as it seeks to break even in the next three to four years.   CEO Thomas Lingelbach was quoted as saying in a newspaper interview on Monday that he sees the group as an attractive takeover target and that it is looking for investors. [ID:nLDE76H0HH]   “We won’t comment on any speculation on whether or not we have an interest in buying Intercell. The rationale for the strategic partnership with Intercell was to gain access to innovation in vaccines, and that has not changed,” Andrin Oswald, head of Novartis’ Vaccines and Diagnostics unit, said.   Last month, Intercell’s partner Merck & Co (MRK.N) decided to discontinue a major trial of a vaccine designed to protect against serious hospital infections, adding to worries about Intercell’s pipeline’s prospects. [ID:nLDE757026]   The group’s stock has lost over 74 percent of its value so far this year as various disappointments have weighed on its volatile shares. Intercell has a free float of nearly 82 percent and is worth around $206 million.   Lingelbach has said he still sees further growth of Intercell’s only marketed product, Ixiaro, a vaccine for Japanese encephalitis, which is a mosquito-borne virus that causes inflammation of the brain.   Intercell is hoping for 60 to 70 percent sales growth this year for the vaccine, though the product’s prospects took a knock earlier this year when Intercell had to recall batches in Europe due to a possible loss of potency. Intercell distributes the vaccine with Novartis.

12,MRK,J&J; warns doctors of Doxil cancer-drug shortage,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson has cautioned doctors not to begin treatment with its Doxil cancer drug because of shortages of the medicine made by an outside manufacturer.  The company had informed doctors last month about a potential shortage of the injectable medicine, made by a unit of German drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim.  In a “Dear Healthcare Provider” letter posted this week on the drug’s website, www.doxil.com, J&J confirmed that a shortage indeed now exists and that new supplies of the medicine will not be shipped until late August.  “Supplies may be intermittently available in the weeks thereafter,” the letter said. “Until then, we advise that no new patients begin treatment with Doxil.”  The injectable drug, which  has annual global sales of about $500 million, is used to treat ovarian cancer and multiple myeloma.  Doxil is among a growing number of drugs made by specialty drugmakers to develop shortages.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has expressed concern that in 2010 there were a record number of drug shortages, and that an increasing number have been seen this year — especially those involving older sterile injectable drugs.  The agency said the shortages have a range of causes, including manufacturing and quality issues, delays and discontinuations.  Other product shortages recently cited by the FDA include Telecris Biotherapeutics Inc’s form of human immune globulin and a number of products sold by Merck & Co — including treatments for black widow spider bites, to prevent shingles and to prevent hepatitis A and hepatitis B.

14,MRK,Generic Zocor propelled pharmacy benefits business," NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters) - Express Scripts (ESRX.O) and Medco Health Solutions MHS.N may not be household names, but they have charted a 20-year rise to a leading role in lowering the cost of medicines for millions of Americans.   Founded in the 1980s, the two companies — now planning a $29.1 billion merger — became major players in healthcare with the introduction of cheap generic versions of Merck & Co’s (MRK.N) multibillion-dollar cholesterol drug Zocor in 2006.   Both are pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, that negotiate and administer drug benefits for employers and health plans to help control rising healthcare costs. Combined they would command nearly one-third of the market, followed by CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N).   They helped push the adoption of generic Zocor by insurers, doctors and patients, and have been a driving force in the use of cheaper medicines. Generic drug use rates now top 70 percent.   Generic Zocor “really created all sorts of new opportunities to find savings for clients by increasing generic penetration and transformed the PBMs into very important cogs in the pharmaceutical supply chain wheel,” said Morningstar analyst Matthew Coffina.   Use of generics not only saves money for clients but carries a higher profit margin for PBMs than more expensive branded medicines.   “Zocor helped put them on the map because they moved medication very quickly from brand to generic. That was confirmation that the PBM model had legs,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Helene Wolk.   Although around for more than 20 years, PBMs really came into their own within the past 10 years as inflation of prescription drugs spending hit the double-digit percentages. The next industry boom is right around the corner.   In 2012, some of the world’s top-selling prescription drugs begin facing generic competition in the United States, including Pfizer’s (PFE.N) cholesterol fighter Lipitor and the blood thinner Plavix, sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) and Sanofi (SASY.PA).   The wave of major patent expirations is set to continue over the next few years.   But consolidation on the scale of the Express-Medco deal may leave consumers worried that cost savings to them could slow with diminished competitive pressure within the industry.

15,MRK,FDA says bone drug benefits exceed risks for now," July 21 (Reuters) - U.S. health regulators on Thursday backed a class of osteoporosis drugs that have been linked to higher risk of cancer and said at this time they believe the drugs’ benefits outweigh potential risks.	   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is currently reviewing data from published studies to evaluate whether use of oral bisphosphonates is associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer and has not reached any conclusions.	   The FDA said there was conflicting data on the risk and insufficient data to recommend endoscopic screening of asymptomatic patients. 	   A British study last year found that people taking the drug for more than five years may be doubling their risk of developing esophageal cancer. 	   Oral bisphosphonates are widely used for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis as well as to treat other bone diseases.	   The drugs include Merck’s Fosamax, Warner Chilcott’s  Actonel, Atelvia and Didronel, Roche’s Boniva, Sanofi’s Skelid, Novartis’  Aredia, Zometa and Reclast.

18,MRK,UPDATE 3-Vertex 4-drug hepatitis C combo shows promise," * Treatment combines VX-222, Incivek and 2 older drugs   * Half of patients on treatment rid of virus in 12 weeks   * Vertex shares fall 0.6 percent  (Adds analyst comment, safety details, background, updates shares)   CHICAGO, July 26 (Reuters) - As many as half of hepatitis C patients in a small midstage trial who received a four-drug combination, including two Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX.O) medicines, were able to stop treatment after just 12 weeks, according to interim results from the study.   Vertex on Tuesday released preliminary results of the trial, which added the company’s experimental oral drug VX-222 to its recently approved Incivek pill and the traditional standard treatments of pegylated interferon and ribaviron.   Interim results of the study, dubbed Zenith, showed that 50 percent of patients (15 of 30) who received the four-drug combination including 400 milligrams of VX-222, were able to stop all treatment at 12 weeks, and that 93 percent of those patients had undetectable virus 12 weeks after treatment ended.   Patients whose response did not make them eligible to halt treatment at 12 weeks, received the two older drugs for another 12 weeks. Of those who continued in the trial, all 13 appeared to be cured after 24 weeks of treatment, Vertex said.   “The patient numbers are relatively small in this study, and the results incomplete, but they are more encouraging than we would have expected,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a research note.   However, Porges cautioned, “it is still too early to declare that VX-222 is a viable drug deserving of significant value in Vertex’s stock price today. The tolerability and safety will need to be established in much larger trials.”   About 130 million to 170 million people worldwide are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus, and more than 350,000 people die from hepatitis C-related liver diseases each year, according to the World Health Organization.   Incivek is widely forecast to become a multibillion-dollar seller and part of the new standard of care for the serious liver disease. It, and a similar new drug from Merck & Co (MRK.N) called Victrelis, are expected to transform treatment for millions of patients by significantly raising cure rates, while cutting the 48-week treatment regimen needed with the older drugs by as much as half for many patients.   Researchers and several companies are hoping that combination therapies with even newer drugs can further cut treatment duration since interferon often causes flu-like symptoms that leave patients feeling miserable.   With a combination that included 100 mg of VX-222 for 12 weeks, a sustained viral response was achieved by 82 percent of patients, or nine of 11.   “The results from this study are the first to show the potential for a combination of multiple direct-acting antiviral medicines to help people with hepatitis C clear the virus with as few as 12 and no more than 24 weeks of treatment,” Robert Kauffman, chief medical officer of Vertex, said in a statement.   Patients in the study had the most common and more difficult to treat genotype 1 form of the disease and had not received prior treatment.   VX-222 belongs to a class of drugs called polymerase inhibitors and works through a different mechanism than Incivek, a protease inhibitor that directly blocks an enzyme essential for viral replication.   The most common side effects from the four-drug regimen were fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, anemia, itchiness and rash. Six patients discontinued treatment because of adverse reactions.   JPMorgan analyst Geoff Meacham called the preliminary safety profile “encouraging,” noting no cases of kidney failure or severe diarrhea.   Vertex shares were down 28 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $49.17 in midday trading on the Nasdaq.   The company is due to report second-quarter results on Thursday, including the first few weeks of sales of Incivek, its first commercial product.

22,MRK,UPDATE 3-New Vertex hepatitis drug shines out of gate," * EPS loss of $0.85 vs Street view loss $0.96   * Incivek sales $74.5 million in first five weeks   * Shares rise 1.6 percent  (Adds company comment, hepatitis background, updates shares)   By Bill Berkrot   NEW YORK, July 28 (Reuters) - Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc’s (VRTX.O) new hepatitis C drug stormed out of the gate, posting sales of nearly $75 million in its first five weeks on the market, and the company’s shares rose.   Incivek, which is likely to become part of the standard of care for hepatitis C and widely expected to become a multibillion-dollar seller, won U.S. approval in May.   “This is a really, really impressive revenue ramp,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges said. “You run this trend forward and you get to $200 million in revenue in the third quarter.”   More than 3,000 patients had started therapy with Incivek by mid-July with a broad mix of previously untreated patients and those who failed to be cured by older drugs, Vertex told analysts and investors on a conference call.   There had been speculation that thousands of patients had been delaying treatment in anticipation of the new medicine and the early sales figures appear to bear that out.   Investors who have been shorting the Vertex stock with a view that Incivek was bound to fall shy of sky-high expectations “are going to be in a world of pain tomorrow,” Porges predicted.   Vertex also said it would file an application seeking U.S. approval of its experimental cystic fibrosis drug, VX-770, in October. It had previously said it would file sometime in the second half of the year.   The company reported a narrower and smaller-than-expected second-quarter net loss as the high cost of launching its first commercial product and higher research and development expenses were offset by strong early demand for the new medicine.   The biotechnology company on Thursday posted a net loss of $174.1 million, or 85 cents per share, compared with a loss of $200 million, or $1 per share, a year ago. Analysts on average expected a loss of 96 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   The company said it expects to be “significantly earnings positive in 2012.”   Total revenue for the quarter of $114.4 million, including $74.5 million from Incivek sales, sailed past Wall Street revenue estimates of $54.3 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   A review of recent analyst expectations for early Incivek sales compiled by ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum found a mean estimate of $31 million, less than half of what sales turned out to be.   Incivek is competing with a similar new drug from Merck & Co (MRK.N) called Victrelis. Incivek prescriptions have been outpacing Victrelis at a rate of better than 3-to-1 in the early going, according to data compiled by Wolters Kluwer’s inThought unit.   “Physicians are opting for the drug that’s easier to use and that’s Incivek,” Porges said.   The new drugs in combination with older standard treatments have demonstrated far higher cure rates than the older medicines alone, as well as the possibility of significantly shorter treatment durations for many patients.   About 170 million people worldwide are chronically infected with hepatitis C, including some 3.2 million Americans who have the serious liver disease that can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer, need for transplant or death if untreated.   The disease is spread primarily through sharing of needles, such as for illegal drugs and tattoos, or from blood transfusions prior to standard blood screening for the virus.   Patients can live with the virus for many years without detecting any symptoms, leading for calls by some for increased hepatitis testing.   Vertex shares were up 1.6 percent in extended trading at $48.75 from their Nasdaq close at $47.98 after initially rising more than 4 percent following the release of the second quarter results.

26,MRK,Merck to slash jobs in cost-savings drive,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) plans to cut another 12,000 to 13,000 jobs by late 2015 to wring out additional annual cost savings of up to $1.5 billion that can be plowed back into research and deal making.  The No. 2 U.S. drugmaker eliminated 12,465 positions last year, offset by almost 6,500 new hires, reducing its workforce to 91,000 employees as of June 30.  The company, which also reported quarterly earnings in line with forecasts, said on Friday it would cut its workforce by an additional 12 percent to 13 percent from the 100,000 employees it had at the end of 2009 after buying Schering-Plough Corp.  A company spokesman declined to peg the planned size of its workforce, saying the job cuts would be substantially offset by new hires in strategic growth areas, such as emerging markets.  “The new phase of restructuring will create an additional $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion in annual cost savings,” company spokesman David Caouette said.  Job cuts will come largely from administrative positions, consolidation of offices and sale or closure of manufacturing sites.  Merck is streamlining operations following its $41 billion purchase of Schering-Plough.  “I think we’re going to see other firms continue to expand their cost-reduction programs,” Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said, pointing to increasingly difficult reimbursement environments in Europe and the United States.  “We have to remember that 10 years ago these firms were extremely bloated and in an entirely different operating mold and it’s really shifted to one where you don’t need the gigantic sales forces that you once needed,” Conover said.  Many other big drugmakers have slashed their workforces in recent years to ensure profit growth as they face patent expirations that will subject them to generic competition, the costs of healthcare reform and efforts by insurers to keep a lid on drug prices.  Eli Lilly LLY.O, facing one of the industry’s biggest “patent cliffs,” said in late 2009 it would cut 5,500 employees, or 13 percent of its workforce, by the end of 2011 to create $1 billion in savings. But like Merck, its cuts have been largely offset by increased hiring in emerging markets.  Before Pfizer bought Wyeth in 2009, the world’s largest drugmaker said it would cut 15 percent of the combined workforce, or almost 20,000 jobs. The company, whose Lipitor cholesterol fighter goes generic late this year, swung its ax again in February, saying it would lay off more than 2,000 researchers to deliver on a 2012 profit forecast.  Merck, unlike many of its rivals, has vowed to maintain research and development spending at stable levels, rather than slash research costs to meet earnings targets. But the company on Friday shaved the high end of its 2011 research budget by $100 million, to between $8 billion and $8.3 billion.  The drugmaker said it halted development of a treatment for migraine headaches, called telcagepant, after unfavorable data from a late-stage trial. The medicine had been linked to liver toxicity in earlier studies.  With the new job cuts, Merck’s restructuring program will yield annual savings of $4 billion to $4.6 billion by the end of 2015, compared with an earlier estimate of $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion by late 2012, Merck said.  The company reported a second-quarter profit in line with Wall Street expectations, helped by big tax gains. But sales handily outpaced forecasts.  It earned $2.02 billion, or 65 cents per share, compared with $752 million, or 24 cents per share, in the year-earlier second quarter, when it took a big restructuring charge for the Schering Plough acquisition.  Excluding special items, Merck earned 95 cents per share, matching the average forecast among analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Global sales rose 7 percent to $12.15 billion, but would have risen only 3 percent if not for the weaker dollar. Sales exceeded Wall Street’s expectations by $370 million, helped by strong sales of newer obesity drugs Januvia and Janumet, arthritis treatment Remicade and vaccines.  The company, which slightly raised the low end of its 2011 profit forecast, now expects earnings of $3.68 billion to $3.76 billion, excluding special items.  Merck shares fell 2.3 percent to $34.13 on the New York Stock Exchange, amid a 0.6 percent decline for the drug sector.

28,MRK,Lawmakers may relax FDA drug conflict rules,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers likely will change the criteria for advisers reviewing new medicines next year because of complaints that the rules meant to prevent conflicts of interest make it harder to find real experts.  Congressional lawmakers may require the Food and Drug Administration to relax the rules that bar advisers from reviewing a drug if they have even indirect financial ties to related manufacturers, as part of an FDA funding bill.  Senators raised the issue during a hearing last week at the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.  “Based on today’s hearing and the comments from Senators Franken and Enzi, I think there is a good chance that this issue could end up in the final FDA user fee bill,” said a congressional staff member familiar with the matter. The staff member was referring to Mike Enzi, the top Republican on the committee and Al Franken, a Democratic committee member.  Fees from makers of drugs and medical devices provide more than a third of the FDA’s funding, which means that the bill often serves as a vehicle for broader FDA-related changes.  The agency often must delay panel meetings while it searches for experts without conflicts, lawmakers and FDA officials say. Top doctors are usually the ones drugmakers hire as speakers or consultants.  “We have had difficulty in recruiting highly qualified people. And we’ve had delays in having panels because of this,” Dr. Janet Woodcock, head of the FDA’s drugs center, told a House of Representatives hearing earlier this month.  The result is that 23 percent of FDA advisory panels have vacancies, more than double the agency’s stated goal, according to the FDA’s quarterly report at the end of May.  The FDA is not required to follow the recommendations of its advisers, but it usually does, leading to scrutiny of who is providing advice.  The FDA tightened guidelines in 2007 to minimize industry ties that could sway a panelist’s view, partly inspired by the scandal with Merck’s pain reliever Vioxx.  Ten of the 32 panelists advising the FDA on the drug consulted for drugmakers. Nine of the 10 recommended putting the drug back on the market after it was pulled in 2004 over concerns about heart risk.  The restrictions go too far, say lawmakers who want the FDA to approve more new medicines, in part because they promote American jobs.  “No longer can we deny experts simply because they have ties to industry,” said Georgia Representative Phil Gingrey during a House of Representative hearing on FDA funding last month. The committee’s chairman, Fred Upton from Michigan, called the conflict of interest rules “rigid and unrealistic.”  Industry executives, who want the FDA to speed drug approvals, also support relaxing the rules. Biogen Idec CEO George Scangos said the guidelines “exclude a lot of people who would be the best qualified.”  Dr. Abraham Thomas, a specialist in diabetes, obesity and bone and mineral disorders, would seem to be the perfect expert to advise the FDA about a new AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers Squibb diabetes pill, which was also tied to some cancer risks and liver and bone injury.  But Thomas works at Henry Ford Hospital, which received as much as $50,000 to study a competing diabetes medicine.  Under the guidelines, even indirect financial links to a competitor barred Dr. Thomas from participating in an advisory panel for the diabetes pill, called dapagliflozin, without a waiver. The FDA decided to grant him one of six waivers given this year, citing his expertise.  Limits on the number of waivers the agency can issue mean the FDA must exclude some experts, which critics say means settling for advice from second-tier specialists who make uninformed decisions.  Ira Loss of Washington Analysis calls the current rules “overkill” for lumping together those with a direct financial relationship to a company or competitor with those who have more indirect links, such as Dr. Thomas.  “If a doctor is involved in a clinical trial, he shouldn’t be allowed on the panel,” he said. “But the rules about the institution where you work. I think that’s ridiculous. ... The result is that you have people on the advisory committee who have no idea what they’re talking about.”  Others say that the agency is not looking hard enough.  A March study from the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Medicine found that 44 percent of cardiologists do not have industry ties.  The study “flat out dismisses this idea that there are no experts who don’t have relationships,” said Eric Campbell, associate professor of medicine at Harvard University and one of the study’s authors.  “There are lots of people out there who are smart and who don’t have conflicts of interest,” said Sid Wolfe of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. “It just takes much more work for the FDA to find them. But the result is you have much less tainting of the panel discussion.  Advocates of stronger rules say the agency lacks the power to force full disclosure, and defines conflicts too narrowly. Members with past financial ties to a company are not considered under the rules, said Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Research Center for Women & Families.  “Those ties affect their voting, whether or not they currently are on the payroll,” she wrote in an email. “Research shows that even small gifts, such as an expensive meal or a $500 honorarium, will affect how a doctor or faculty member feels about a company and could affect how they vote.”  Consumer advocates and lawmakers are more likely to agree when it comes to reviewing drugs for rare diseases.  “If waivers need to be granted, we hope that the FDA will limit them to rare and neglected diseases where there are truly few experts available,” Consumers Union wrote in comments to the FDA’s conflicts of interest regulation.  FDA Commissioner Hamburg said calls to relax some conflict of interest rules were “a valid concern.  “Especially when you’re talking about rare and unusual diseases, getting new experts is more challenging, as many were involved in the development or trials of drugs under consideration,” she told the Senate hearing last week.  “I’m not surprised this issue keeps coming up,” Hamburg said after the hearing.  (Corrects 11th paragraph to show that 10 of the 32 panelists  consulted for drugmakers, not “the drugmaker”. And that nine of those 10 recommended putting Vioxx back on the market, not all 10, as first sent)  ",8012011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fda-bias/lawmakers-may-relax-fda-drug-conflict-rules-idUSTRE7703R320110801

33,MRK,Scientists find new ovarian cancer gene," LONDON, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Women who carry a faulty copy of a gene called RAD51D have an almost one in 11 chance of developing ovarian cancer, scientists said on Sunday in a finding they called the most significant ovarian cancer gene discovery for more than 10 years.	   Tests to identify those at highest risk are expected to be available within a few years, according to Cancer Research UK, and may lead some women to decide to have their ovaries removed in order to beat the disease.	   The finding should also speed the search for new drugs.	   Laboratory experiments already suggest that cells with faulty RAD51D are sensitive to PARP inhibitors - a new class of drugs designed to target cancers caused by faults in two known breast and ovarian cancer genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2.	   Several large drugmakers, including Abbott , Merck  , Pfizer , Sanofi-Aventis and AstraZeneca , are developing PARP inhibitors, which work by blocking DNA repair mechanisms in cancer cells, stalling the cell cycle and leading to cell death. 	   Data released in May showed that one of these, AstraZeneca’s olaparib, was able to slow the progression of ovarian cancer in a mid-stage clinical trial. 	   For the latest study, researchers from Britain’s Institute of Cancer Research compared the DNA of women from 911 families with ovarian and breast cancer to DNA from a control group of more than 10,000 people from the general population.	   They found eight faults in the RAD51D gene in women with cancer, compared with only one in the control group.	   “Women with a fault in the RAD51D gene have a one in 11 chance of developing ovarian cancer,” said Nazneen Rahman of the Institute of Cancer Research and The Royal Marsden in London, who led the study and published its findings in the journal Nature Genetics.	   Ovarian cancer can remain hidden for a long time and thus is often not discovered until it is advanced.	   An estimated 230,000 women worldwide are diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year. Most are not diagnosed before the cancer has spread, and up to 70 percent of them die within five years.	   Because of this, Rahman said, women with the faulty gene may decide their best option is to have their ovaries removed after they have children — particularly if they have already seen other family members die of the disease.	   Speaking to Reuters in a telephone interview she said the identification of RAD51D pointed to PARP inhibitors as a new class of drugs that might offer fresh hope. Initial tests in the laboratory found that cells with faulty RAD51D were highly sensitive to this class of drugs. 	   “PARP inhibitors work because they were designed to target DNA repair pathways,” she said. “They haven’t been used in patients in that context yet but we would predict they would behave in the same way.”	 	  (Editing by Sophie Walker)	  ",8072011,http://www.reuters.com/article/cancer-ovarian/scientists-find-new-ovarian-cancer-gene-idUSL6E7J515R20110807

37,MRK,"Analysis: New drugs add mileage to Bristol, Vertex and Amgen","NEW YORK (Reuters) - New drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Vertex Pharmaceuticals are selling fast out of the gate, and their recent share sell-offs provide investors with a new opportunity to profit from the medicines’ bright futures.  Bristol’s melanoma drug Yervoy and Vertex’s hepatitis C treatment Incivek, as well as Amgen’s Xgeva for preventing bone fractures in cancer patients stormed past early sales projections because they are simply too good to be ignored, industry experts said.  “Vertex doubled the cure rate and Yervoy is the only drug approved ever that improved survival in melanoma,” said Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst for ISI Group. “It becomes immediately medically unacceptable to not use them in patients whom you are treating, and there’s no debate around it.”  “Xgeva is not quite as dramatic, but they did do a head-to-head trial with the current standard of care and they beat it,” Schoenebaum added.  All three medicines are expected to generate eventual annual sales in excess of $1 billion, with some analyst estimates for Incivek running north of $3 billion.  All arrived to doctors and patients clamoring for new treatments, proving the value of innovative medicines as many drugmakers stand to lose billions of dollars of revenue as older products come off patent.  “They are all first in class drugs for diseases that have not been well treated prior. If companies can deliver drugs that deliver the goods they are going to be successful,” said Les Funtleyder, portfolio manager for Miller Tabak & Co.  Bristol shares are off about 9 percent since a year-high on July 21, Amgen shares are down more than 17 percent since touching a year-high in mid-May and Vertex has fallen 25 percent since reaching a high in May just prior to Incivek’s approval — all dragged down along with broader market plunges.  Analysts believe there is money to be made betting on any of these companies, especially with shares in their current beaten down state.  Schoenebaum said Amgen was a bargain at its current price, and that the ease of tracking Incivek prescription growth makes Vertex attractive. His Amgen price target of $68 is well above the current share price of around $48, while his Vertex price target of $54 leaves room to grow from its current price of about $43.  “Bristol is clearly right now the best company within the U.S. large pharma arena,” he added.  The most bullish Wall Street price targets see Amgen rising as much as 63 percent, Vertex nearly doubling and Bristol-Myers with room to grow by 47 percent, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters.  All three recently approved medicines soared past most initial Wall Street sales estimates in the second quarter, defying the typical slow launch for most new medicines.  “There are demographic trends that would suggest that these drugs are going to see more demand,” said Funtleyder, who agreed that it was not too late to jump on the bandwagon.  In just its first five weeks on the market, Incivek sales reached $74.5 million.  “What this means is there are a lot of patients out there waiting for treatment with new hepatitis C drugs,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges.  “This is a genuine breakthrough. It’s dramatically altering the outlook for these patients and they’re lining up at physicians’ offices,” Porges said.  Much the same can be said for Yervoy, which in March became the first FDA approved treatment to offer real hope to patients with the deadliest form of skin cancer.  Yervoy, which spurs the immune system to fight the cancer, posted sales of $95 million in its first quarter on the market, helping Bristol to a better-than-expected second quarter profit.  Xgeva, which offers potential for a better quality of life to advanced cancer patients in danger of serious bone problems, nearly doubled expectations in its first full quarter on the market and recorded $75 million in second quarter sales, sailing past analysts’ average estimates of $66 million.  They stand in stark contrast to Dendreon Corp’s year-old prostate cancer vaccine Provenge, which was approved with great fanfare but has yet to catch on with physicians. The company last week pulled its bullish 2011 sales forecast, saying doctors were balking at dealing with reimbursement for its high price tag.  While Amgen and Bristol are looking to their new drugs to help replace fading sales of older products or those about to face generic competition, Incivek is the first commercial product for far smaller Vertex. But the biotech company was well prepared for its foray into uncharted territory.  Two years prior to Incivek approval, Chief Executive Joshua Boger — long the soul of Vertex and the visionary behind the medicine — stepped aside to make way for Matthew Emmens, a sales savvy CEO with several drug launches under his belt.  “They are lucky to have him. He’s got a very good track record,” Funtleyder said of Emmens. “Drug development and drug sales are two different skill sets and not everyone has both.”  That move, as well as the drug’s superior efficacy, appears to be paying off. Early Incivek prescriptions are outpacing those for a similar new rival drug from Merck & Co by a rate of better than three-to-one.  Investors may also do well to get behind companies with a new class of drug for preventing blood clots and strokes in heart patients.  The first of the new blood thinners, Pradaxa, comes from privately held Boehringer Ingelheim. But demand for that drug — more than 250,000 patients prescribed in its first seven months — bodes well for others, including apixaban from Bristol and Pfizer that may prove to be superior.

40,MRK,COLUMN-Vioxx judge steps in to split lawyers' fees: Frankel,"   -- Alison Frankel writes the On the Case blog for Thomson Reuters News & Insight (newsandinsight.com). The views expressed are her own. --   By Alison Frankel   NEW YORK, Aug 11 (Reuters) - It was easier for the plaintiffs lawyers who represented victims of Merck & Co Inc’s (MRK.N) Vioxx painkiller to finalize a $4.85 billion settlement with Merck than to reach a fee-sharing agreement with one another.   On Wednesday, the New Orleans federal court judge who presided over the Vioxx multidistrict litigation issued a 132-page final order distributing $350 million in so-called “common benefit attorneys fees” to the lawyers whose work in the MDL contributed to the 2007 global settlement with Merck. In case you weren’t keeping track, total plaintiffs lawyers’ fees in the Vioxx litigation were capped at $1.55 billion, of which more than $1 billion has already been paid out; the $350 million in common benefit fees, which comes out of that $1.55 billion, represents money that all of the lawyers who collected Vioxx contingency fees owe to the small group of plaintiffs lawyers responsible for bringing Merck to the table and negotiating a deal with the drug maker.   Judge Eldon Fallon is the most patient of jurists, but even he was disheartened by the ugliness of the fight over the $350 in common benefit fees — skirmishing that involved a special court-appointed committee of plaintiffs lawyers, a special discovery master, two rounds of objections from lawyers who claimed the committee had a conflict of interest, and a week-long hearing in which committee members and objectors had the chance to cross-examine one another. After a 10-page description of the bitter process, Fallon wrote, “Counsel for individual [Vioxx] claimants have already received over one billion dollars pursuant to contingent fee agreements. Many, if not all, of the common benefit fee applicants are also primary counsel in at least some if not many cases and thus have already received substantial compensation pursuant to contingency fee agreements with their own clients,” the judge continued. “For this reason, it is disconcerting and disappointing to receive such vexatious, vitriolic, and acerbic briefs from some of the attorneys who seek common benefit fees.”   In the end, Judge Fallon noted, only four of the 18 firms that objected to the original allocation plan refused to go along with the final version. Two of those firms are the biggest losers in Fallon’s order. Escobedo, Tippit & Cardenas and The Snapka Law Firm were co-counsel in an early Vioxx trial in Texas state court, winning a $32 million verdict that was later reversed and is still on appeal. Although Escobeda Tippit’s case was not part of the MDL and the firm didn’t do any work in the MDL, Escobeda claimed its trial benefitted other Vioxx claimants. Along with Snapka, it asked for a total of $31.5 million. Judge Fallon awarded Escobeda $1.6 million and Snapka (which had a limited role in the MDL) $1.1 million for their case’s “salutary effect on the Vioxx litigation.” (I left messages with both firms but didn’t hear back.) Another objector, The Branch firm, asked for $3.9 million for its work on New Jersey state court Vioxx cases that allegedly helped drive the company to settlement talks. Judge Fallon awarded the firm $500,000. (Turner Branch didn’t return my call.)   The plaintiffs firms taking home the biggest share of the $350 million are Seeger Weiss and Beasley Allen, both of which were awarded $36.6 million by Judge Fallon. (The Beasley award was about $500,000 less than the plaintiffs lawyer special committee originally recommended; Seeger Weiss was awarded $4.3 million less than the committee originally proposed.) Herman, Herman, Katz & Cotlar, which led the allocation process and took much of the heat from objectors, was awarded $26 million, a $6.5 million haircut from the $32.5 million recommended by the plaintiffs lawyers’ committee. Judge Fallon awarded The Lanier Law Firm, which won a huge verdict in the first Vioxx case to go to trial and helped financed the MDL, the entire $27 million the committee recommended.   The other big winners in Judge Fallon’s allocation are Levin, Fishbein, Sedran & Berman ($19 million); Girardi & Keese ($18.2 million); a consortium of five Texas firms ($18 million); Weitz & Luxenberg ($17.8 million); Levin, Papantinio, Thomas, Mitchell, Eschner & Proctor ($13.9 million); and Blizzard, McCarthy & Nabers ($10.5 million).

42,MRK,Experts to hunt down rogue genes for China's cholesterol problem,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Scientists in Hong Kong are embarking on a study to identify genes that are responsible for high cholesterol and heart disease in patients in southern China, which they hope will pave the way for the design of better drugs.  While cholesterol levels are coming under control in some Western countries due to drugs and healthier lifestyles, they are shooting ever higher in China, leading to higher incidence of heart disease and stroke.

46,MRK,Intercell beats Q2 views with strong vaccine sales,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Strong sales growth for its Japanese encephalitis vaccine helped Austrian biotech group Intercell ICEL.VI post a much narrower-than-expected net loss for the second quarter on Tuesday, sharply boosting its shares in early trading.  The group said it was on track to meet its 2011 growth forecast after posting a second-quarter net loss of 1.6 million euros ($2.3 million), easily beating the average forecast of 9.5 million in a Reuters poll as it also benefited from restructuring efforts and a milestone payment by Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N).  “First strategic initiatives have already been implemented, and due to the best quarterly sales result of Ixiaro/Jespect, the company achieved significant revenue growth,” the group said in a statement.  “Hence, Intercell is on track to meet its expectation of a full-year 2011 growth rate of 60-70 percent.”  Intercell said sales of Ixiaro, a vaccine for Japanese encephalitis, a mosquito-borne virus that causes inflammation of the brain, jumped 85 percent in the first half.  Sales of the vaccine reached 7.0 mln euros in the second quarter, up 34.6 percent from a year earlier.  At 4:10 a.m. EDT, Intercell shares were trading 16.75 percent stronger, outperforming a 0.74 percent drop in the European healthcare index .SXDP.  Intercell, Europe’s last independent vaccine maker, has had a tough year after a string of product setbacks, and has said it is open to being bought.  Earlier this year, Merck & Co decided to discontinue a major trial of a vaccine designed to protect against serious hospital infections, adding to worries about Intercell’s pipeline prospects.  Recently appointed Chief Executive Thomas Lingelbach also is looking to slash costs by more than 50 percent in a strategy review as the group seeks to break even in the next three to four years.  The group’s stock has lost more than 78 percent of its value this year as disappointments have weighed on its volatile shares. Intercell has a free float of nearly 82 percent and is now worth around $176 million.  “We acknowledge it will take time for management to rebuild credibility, deliver late-stage pipeline news, and grow Ixiaro sales to meaningfully fund R&D,” analysts at Jefferies said in a note.  “But we retain our Buy as we feel the current share price substantially undervalues Ixiaro, the Phase II-III pseudomonas vaccine and technology platforms,” they said.

47,MRK,Glaxo HPV vaccine protects women from anal cancer: study,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A vaccine to prevent cervical cancer offered strong protection against anal cancer in a large study of women in Costa Rica, adding to evidence that such vaccines can protect against more than just cervical cancer, U.S. researchers said on Monday.  The study, conducted by researchers at the National Institutes of Health, involved GlaxoSmithKline’s Cervarix vaccine, which protects against infections triggered by strains 16 and 18 of the human papillomavirus (HPV).  “There was strong protection with the vaccine against anal infection,” Dr. Aimee Kreimer of the National Cancer Institute, whose study appears in the journal Lancet Oncology, said in a telephone interview.  GlaxoSmithKline’s Cervarix and Merck & Co’s Gardasil protect against cervical cancer, the second most common cancer in women worldwide. But various strains of HPV also cause anal, penile, head and neck cancers.  Although rare, anal cancers have doubled in some countries in recent decades. Anal intercourse can increase the risk for anal cancers caused by HPV infections, and while there are more infections in women overall, men who have sex with men are especially vulnerable.  Kreimer’s team wanted to see the how well HPV vaccines protected against this type of cancer. Her team found that rates of protection in the study were comparable with those seen in cervical HPV infections.  “We know anal HPV 16, but also 18, cause the bulk of anal cancers. We know if we remove the infection, it will greatly reduce the likelihood for the cancer,” she said.  For the study, the researchers analyzed anal tissue specimens in a group of 4,210 healthy women aged 18-25 from Costa Rica. About half got the vaccine in three doses, and the other half got a placebo vaccine. The women were tested after 4 years for anal and cervical HPV 16 and 18 infections.  They found the vaccine prevented 62 percent of anal cancers and 77 percent of cervical cancers caused by HPV infection compared with rates in the general population.  In women with no likely previous exposure to HPV infection, the vaccine prevented 84 percent of anal HPV infections, a rate similar to the 89 percent rate against cervical HPV infection.  The team also found that Cervarix protected was cross-protective against other cancer-causing HPV types 31, 33 and 45.  “We’re getting more bang for our buck than we realized with this vaccine,” Kreimer said.  The study adds to evidence that HPV vaccines may protect against more than just cervical cancer.  Last December, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Merck’s Gardasil HPV vaccine for prevention of anal cancers in both men and women, based on studies showing it was effective in men who have sex with men, a group that has a higher incidence of anal cancer.  U.S. vaccine advisers have been weighing whether boys and young men should be routinely vaccinated against HPV, but some worry the vaccine is too costly to justify its use.  Currently, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends HPV vaccinations for girls and women between the ages of 11 and 26. And while doctors are free to vaccinate boys and men ages 9 through 26, health officials so far have stopped short of a recommendation for routine vaccination for males.  Kreimer said she is not sure if her study adds enough evidence for broader use of the vaccine, but it does add evidence that HPV vaccination can protect women of average risk in the general population from anal cancer.  “I do think it is getting close to a tipping point, but I don’t know if we are there yet,” she said.  An estimated 5,300 new U.S. cases of anal cancer are diagnosed each year.

51,MRK,Drug may help ease Ramadan headaches: study,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A painkilling, anti-inflammatory drug may help prevent headaches in Muslims fasting from dawn to dusk for Ramadan, according to a study from Israel — where a “Yom Kippur headache” is also known.  About four in every ten people who abstain from food and water all day during the month-long Ramadan period get headaches, said the study, published in the journal Headache. This year, Ramadan began on August 1.  “Religious fasting is associated with headache,” wrote lead researcher Michael Drescher, from Hartford Hospital in Connecticut, the United States, referring to Ramadan and Judaism’s Yom Kippur, when people fast for 25 hours.  “This has been documented as the ‘Yom Kippur headache’ and ‘first of Ramadan headache.’”  Doctors aren’t quite sure what causes them. It could be dehydration, or caffeine withdrawal in people who are used to getting their morning coffee, Drescher told Reuters Health.  “There’s probably more than one thing going on,” he added.  Drescher and his Israel-based colleagues had already shown that Jews who took the drug known as etoricoxib, or Arcoxia, before fasting for 25 hours on the Yom Kippur holiday got fewer headaches than those who didn’t.  Arcoxia, a cousin of the painkiller Vioxx, isn’t approved for use in the United States because the Food and Drug Administration decided it was too similar to Vioxx, which Merck pulled from the market in 2004 when it was linked to a higher risk of heart attack. But Arcoxia is available in Israel, among other countries.  The drug has a longer-lasting effect than some other painkillers, which is important because taking a pill in the middle of the day when a headache sets in would be considered breaking the fast.  “If you take Tylenol (acetaminophen)... by the time you get around to feeling the effects of the fast, the medicine is long out of your system,” Drescher said.  To see how Arcoxia would work during Ramadan, the researchers assigned 222 adults planning to fast in 2010 to either take the drug or an inactive placebo pill just before the start of fasting each day. All participants recorded how often they had a headache, and how severe it was.  After a week they switched treatments.  During the first day of fasting, when headaches are thought to be most common, 21 percent of people taking Arcoxia reported having a headache, compared to 46 percent of those who took the placebo pill.  The Arcoxia group also reported fewer total headaches during that first week, the researchers wrote. And when they did have headaches, they rated them as less severe than participants taking the placebo.  After a week, there was no longer any difference in symptoms between the groups, partly because even the people taking the placebo reported fewer headaches during fasting as time went on.  Drescher said this sort of finding had been noticed before.  “As to why exactly it happens, we don’t know. Perhaps the body goes through some sort of desensitization to the fasting,” he said.  He added that although the researchers didn’t contact any Muslim religious authorities about the use of the drug during fasting, none of the participants voiced any objection to it.  When the researchers previously talked to rabbis about use of Arcoxia during Yom Kippur, the Jewish leaders pointed out that not having a headache could allow people to be “freer spiritually.”  “The religious edict to fast really is not a command to suffer,” Drescher added.  The study was funded by Merck, which makes the drug, and two of the study's six authors are company employees.

53,MRK,Separate paths lead to promising cholesterol drug,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Discovery of one of the most promising cholesterol fighters in decades began in 1999 with Catherine Boileau, a Paris scientist who was seeking a genetic reason why 19 members of two French families she was studying had sky-high levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol.  Their LDL levels were in the 300 to 400 range, making them prone to early heart attack and death. Using gene-mapping, Boileau and colleagues at Paris-Ouest Medical School theorized that a gene in a specific area of Chromosome 1 was responsible.  She published her limited findings in the American Journal of Human Genetics the same year, an important step in what may pave the way for the next big breakthrough in treating heart disease.  For the following three years, Boileau and doctoral student Marianne Abifadel painstakingly analyzed about 50 genes in the chromosome, but none emerged as the likely culprit. With scores of other genes left to examine, her phone rang one day.  “I know you don’t know me, and I don’t know you, but we seem to be working on something similar,” said biochemist Nabil Seidah from the Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, who had read Boileau’s 1999 paper.  Seidah, in conducting unrelated research, had discovered a gene on Chromosome 1 which he quickly speculated might regulate cholesterol. He found the gene produced a protein highly present on the surface of liver cells, which are responsible for most of the body’s production of cholesterol.  “Catherine asked me, ‘How do you know this is the same gene I’m looking for?’ And I said, ‘I don’t, but I have a hint because it’s very rich in the liver.’”  Boileau then turned her full attention to the gene and its protein, an enzyme later named PCSK9. It was the ninth member of a family of enzymes Seidah had discovered, all of which were involved in activating hormones and cell-surface proteins.  “It was a very bewildering new protein, also found in the kidney and the brain, but we didn’t know what it does,” Boileau said.  Further analysis showed that all affected members of one French family had an identical mutation in the PCSK9 gene, while members of a smaller affected family shared a different mutation.  Although the mutations were different, they both appeared to have the same effect of creating LDL levels in the bloodstream five to 10 times higher than levels found in the general population. Some family members began showing signs of heart disease in their teenage years.  Boileau and Seidah published their joint findings in June 2003, but were still unaware of just how the gene functioned.  An answer came the following year from Rockefeller University in New York, where researcher Jan Breslow and his doctoral assistant Kara Maxwell had conducted mouse studies of the newly discovered gene and protein.  “We took the gene and put it into a virus, and then injected the virus into normal mice,” thereby elevating their PCSK9 beyond normal degrees, recalls Breslow. “Within just a day or two, the mice went from having very low levels of bad cholesterol to high levels that resemble what we see with familial hypercholesterolemia. It was a result that was so clear, and that doesn’t come along every day with research.”  Breslow’s studies showed that PCSK9 wipes out LDL receptors, proteins that bind to LDL cholesterol in the liver and remove the artery-clogging substance from the bloodstream.  The mechanism is just one of many ways the body regulates levels of LDL — to make sure there is enough of it to perform vital body functions, although not more than is necessary. By destroying LDL receptors, PCSK9 allows LDL to build in the bloodstream.  The specific mutations in PCSK9 found in the French families — called “gain-in-function” mutations — made the protein 10-fold more active than natural PCSK9 in destroying LDL receptors. It was doing its job far too well.  A separate discovery in Dallas, Texas, supplied remaining pieces of the PCSK9 puzzle in 2005.  It came from a laboratory at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, where Michael Brown and Joseph Goldstein had won Nobel Prizes in 1985 for discovering the LDL receptor.  Helen Hobbs and Jonathan Cohen, colleagues of Brown and Goldstein, discovered that 2 percent of African-Americans in their study group had a far different inherited mutation in the PCSK9 gene.  Instead of elevating their LDL levels — as seen with the mutations in Boileau’s study — it led to LDL levels a third lower than those seen in the general population. And the mutation, by largely disabling PCSK9, had have greatly shielded the group from heart disease.  The surprise findings suggested that blocking PCSK9 with drugs might offer similar benefits.  “The therapeutic implications are immense,” Brown said after Hobbs’ and Cohen’s conclusions were published, calling them the most important work in cholesterol metabolism since his and Goldstein’s discoveries a generation earlier.

54,MRK,Separate paths lead to promising cholesterol drug," NEW YORK, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Discovery of one of the most promising cholesterol fighters in decades began in 1999 with Catherine Boileau, a Paris scientist who was seeking a genetic reason why 19 members of two French families she was studying had sky-high levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol.   Their LDL levels were in the 300 to 400 range, making them prone to early heart attack and death. Using gene-mapping, Boileau and colleagues at Paris-Ouest Medical School theorized that a gene in a specific area of Chromosome 1 was responsible.

55,MRK,Insight: Next big drug against cholesterol takes shape,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A handful of drugmakers are racing to develop a new class of medicines they believe could be the biggest weapon against heart disease since statins were introduced in the 1980s.  The contest is taking place largely out of public view, but researchers and industry analysts say excitement is building over the injectable medicines. They work by blocking PCSK9, a protein whose natural function is to preserve levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol in the bloodstream.  Researchers in Paris, Montreal and Dallas, through experiments with thousands of patients that began in 1999, discovered the gene behind PCSK9 and deciphered its function.  Biotechnology company Regeneron and its big pharmaceutical partner Sanofi are now ahead of the pack in developing a drug that goes after PCSK9. A single injection of their medicine, called REGN727, slashed LDL levels by more than 60 percent for a month in an early trial. Results from mid-stage studies are expected later this year.  “The PCSK9 mechanism is perhaps one of the best examples we have in all of medicine of how the study of genetics can identify new targets for developing new therapies,” said Dr. Daniel Rader, a noted heart researcher at the University of Pennsylvania.  Although no serious side effects have been seen with REGN727, larger trials are needed to rule out problems such as liver toxicity or raised blood pressure that have wrecked other promising heart drugs, including Pfizer Inc’s experimental torcetrapib.  Rader, who is a consultant to several of the companies developing PCSK9 inhibitors, said most drugmakers are working on once-a-month injections that would likely be self-administered by patients using very small needles. Some drugs might eventually be administered every two to three months, he said.  Amgen Inc, Merck & Co, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc and a partnership between Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc are in hot pursuit, with rival drugs of their own.  The anti-PCSK9 medicines are expected to be used alongside statins, such as Pfizer’s Lipitor and AstraZeneca Plc’s Crestor, for patients who do not achieve cholesterol-lowering goals with statins alone.  They would also be used on their own for a much smaller group who cannot tolerate statins — oral drugs with global annual sales of $20 billion that inhibit the liver’s production of LDL cholesterol.  In the United States, more than 10 million patients could ultimately be candidates for the new family of medicines. Industry analysts say the products could command $1,000 a month or more because of their potential importance to high-risk patients. Statins cost about $130 a month for branded pills like Lipitor, which is due to lose U.S. patent protection later this year, or far less for other products already available as generics.  For a graphic on top-selling cholesterol fighters, see: r.reuters.com/wuq43s The clearest advantage so far has been seen in Regeneron’s new drug. Data from initial studies suggests REGN727 may be able to reduce LDL by another 50 percent when used in combination with statins, which themselves can cut LDL in half.  “Regeneron’s anti-PCSK9 antibody really looks like a magic bullet against LDL cholesterol” said Ziad Bakri, a biotechnology analyst with T. Rowe Price. His firm is one of Regeneron’s largest shareholders, with a 9.5 percent stake as of the end of June.  Assuming longer-term studies demonstrate the drug is safe and prevents heart attacks and stroke, Bakri estimates it could capture annual sales “in the billions of dollars” if approved.  “Taking advantage of this pathway is a creative leap forward,” said Dr. Kristin Newby, a Duke University heart researcher who has no involvement in PCSK9 research.  But she cautioned that other classes of novel medicines have stumbled because of unexpected safety problems.  She cited torcetrapib, a drug to raise “good” HDL cholesterol that Pfizer had expected to reap annual sales of more than $10 billion. Meant to drive down the incidence of heart attacks, the drug instead was linked to deaths and was scrapped in 2006 after costly late-stage trials.  Data from a similar HDL-raising drug being developed by Roche Holding AG will be released on Sunday at the annual meeting of the European Society of Cardiology in Paris. But cutting LDL cholesterol remains the most proven way of reducing heart attacks and stroke, and is the industry’s prime focus.  Should PCSK9 inhibitors stumble, it would be a keen disappointment for some of the world’s biggest drugmakers.  Amgen, the largest global biotech company, is wrapping up early-stage trials of its PCSK9 inhibitor and will soon advance it into Phase II studies.  “There’s a real opportunity to change the paradigm of treating cardiovascular disease with this therapy,” said Scott Wasserman, Amgen’s global project leader for cardiovascular medicines.  Andrew Plump, head of cardiovascular discovery for Merck, cautions that long-term trials must confirm the value of PCSK9 blockers. But he predicts that when used with statins, they could reduce heart attack and stroke risk 25 to 30 percent beyond the 25 to 30 percent reduced risk seen with statins alone.  “PCSK9 is one of the most interesting proteins in the human body,” Plump said. “We didn’t know anything about it a decade ago, and the speed at which drug programs have progressed is astounding.”  Merck has not disclosed details of its PCSK9 program, but Plump said the company is interested in developing injectable and pill formulations.  Former Merck chief executive Roy Vagelos, who introduced the world’s first statin Mevacor in 1987, is helping oversee development of Regeneron’s product as chairman of its board.  Two Nobel Prize winners whose research directly led to discovery of statins, Michael Brown and Joseph Goldstein, are members of Regeneron’s board, as is Christine Poon, former head of Johnson & Johnson’s pharmaceuticals group.  “This is a big, enormous opportunity,” Regeneron Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer said in an interview. “It could become one of the biggest drugs in biotechnology.”  Regeneron also hopes to benefit from the expertise of partner Sanofi, whose Plavix blood clot preventer has annual sales of more than $9 billion. The companies aim to split any profits evenly from their PCSK9 medicine.  In a series of experiments conducted separately by four research teams, scientists showed that PCSK9 wipes out LDL receptors, proteins that bind to LDL cholesterol in the liver and remove the artery-clogging substance from the bloodstream.  The mechanism is one of many ways the body regulates LDL to make sure there is enough of it to perform vital body functions, although not more than is necessary. But when PCSK9 goes overboard in destroying LDL receptors, LDL rises to harmful levels.  While early studies focused on patients with genetic mutations that triggered sky-high production of LDL, Helen Hobbs and colleague Jonathan Cohen theorized in 2005 that other mutations in PCSK9 might exist and have the opposite effect: of inactivating the gene and thereby leading to lower LDL levels.  They examined the structure of the gene in African-Americans who had low LDL. Their research showed that 2 percent of them had an inherited mutated form of the gene, and that their LDL levels were about a third lower than individuals without the mutation. The two researchers from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center went on to show that the subjects were protected from heart disease.  The findings strongly suggested the possible benefits of blocking PCSK9 or its activity.  “We knew what we had right away: the potential for a new way to lower LDL levels in humans,” Hobbs said.  Two young women found to have no PCSK9 at all had LDL levels of just 14 to 16 — one-eighth normal levels. Yet they were deemed to be in good health, suggesting to Hobbs and others that blocking PCSK9 may not pose great safety risks.  “The reaction to Dr. Hobbs’ findings was electric among those who understood the field,” said Dr. Daniel Steinberg, professor emeritus at the University of California-San Diego. “The science was solid and suggested that blocking PCSK9 could be as important as statins in terms of controlling coronary artery disease.”  Steinberg, who has written extensively on PCSK9, said that patients with the protective mutation were shown to have an almost 90 percent reduced risk of coronary artery disease, compared with the general population.  “That’s probably because their LDL has been low from birth,” he said. Steinberg said anti-PCSK9 drugs could save tens of thousands of lives a year, as statins now do.  Statins actually raise levels of PCSK9, thereby undermining their own effectiveness in reducing LDL. “So if you give a statin, plus a PCSK9 inhibitor, you could get a bigger bang for your buck,” Steinberg said.  Patients taking PCSK9 inhibitors might also be able to take lower doses of statins, and thereby avoid their side effects, such as muscle weakness and liver toxicity.  Some studies suggest PCSK9 may help regenerate liver tissue, so drugs that block it theoretically could pose a risk to alcoholics or others with existing liver damage.  Studies will test the liver risk, and also show whether the new medicines affect HDL cholesterol or cause side effects in other organs where PCSK9 is concentrated.  While safety must be established, Alnylam research executive Akshay Vaishnaw is betting on PCSK9 drugs.  “There’s no question that this is going to be the greatest intervention, following statins, for treatment of high cholesterol. It’s absolutely going to be the next big thing.”  ",8262011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cholesterol/insight-next-big-drug-against-cholesterol-takes-shape-idUSTRE77P53O20110826

58,MRK,"Roche cholesterol drug ""fine"" for blood pressure"," * Dalcetrapib didn’t raise blood pressure in Phase II   * Result builds hopes for HDL-raising drugs    By Ben Hirschler	   PARIS, Aug 28 (Reuters) - An experimental drug from Roche  raised “good” HDL cholesterol substantially without increasing blood pressure, the problem that sank a rival treatment from Pfizer , researchers said on Sunday.	   The data from a relatively small Phase II trial may increase confidence in the high-risk project, although the key test of whether dalcetrapib saves lives in heart patients will not be known until a large Phase III trial finishes in late 2012.	   Dr Thomas Luescher of University Hospital Zurich said the new drug was generally well tolerated by patients and did not impair flow in blood vessels or raise blood pressure, as tested after four weeks of treatment.	   After 36 weeks of treatment, dalcetrapib had increased high-density cholesterol (HDL) levels by an average 31 percent and no safety problems were seen. The study involved 476 patients who received either dalcetrapib or placebo.	   In contrast to another small study of the drug, details of which were released a week ago, there was no difference in the number of adverse cardiovascular events seen between patients on dalcetrapib and those on placebo.	   However, neither of the two studies was large enough to detect significant differences in such outcomes.	   It is still early days for dalcetrapib, and medical experts remain wary following the high-profile failure of a similar drug from Pfizer called torcetrapib. There is also a lack of evidence — so far at least — that raising HDL with drugs actually stops heart attacks and strokes. 	   But the latest findings, presented at the European Society of Cardiology annual meeting, will encourage researchers and may also a boost the broader field, which includes another experimental HDL-boosting drug from Merck & Co .	   Industry analysts believe dalcetrapib, which Roche bought in from Japan Tobacco , could become a major seller if it proves itself in final-stage Phase III tests. 	   Andrew Weiss, an analyst at Vontobel, last week gave  dalcetrapib a 30 percent chance of success, based on the results of the first study. He believes the medicine could generate peak sales of 4 billion Swiss francs ($5 billion), if it works. 	   That would make it a major product for Roche and one that would start to diversify its focus firmly beyond cancer treatments, where it is the market leader.

60,MRK,Judge narrows benchmark Fosamax case vs. Merck,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday threw out part of a bellwether lawsuit against Merck & Co over claims that its osteoporosis drug Fosamax causes jaw damage.  The plaintiff, Linda Secrest, may pursue her claim that Fosamax suffered from a design defect and caused her jawbone tissue to die, a condition known as osteonecrosis of the jaw, or ONJ, District Judge John Keenan wrote.  But the judge said Secrest, a former United Airlines flight attendant living in Florida, cannot pursue punitive damages or her claim that Merck failed to warn of possible problems with Fosamax, saying no reasonable jury could rule in her favor.  The lawsuit is the fourth bellwether case over Fosamax, which generated billions of dollars in annual sales for Merck before the Whitehouse Station, New Jersey-based company lost U.S. patent protection in 2008, allowing generic sales.  Results of bellwether cases may foreshadow the potential outcomes of other, similar lawsuits.  Merck has said it faced roughly 1,650 Fosamax-related cases in various courts as of June 30, including 910 before Keenan.  It won two of the earlier bellwether trials, while a jury ordered it to pay $8 million to the plaintiff in the third case.  Keenan later reduced that payout to $1.5 million, prompting the plaintiff, Shirley Boles, to request a new trial on damages. Merck appealed a separate legal issue to the federal appeals court in New York.  Timothy O’Brien, a lawyer representing Secrest and Boles, said in an email that the same claims were dismissed in both cases, and that the $8 million Boles verdict was based solely on a defective design claim.  Merck spokesman Ron Rogers said: “We are satisfied with today’s ruling, and we will vigorously defend the company on the remaining claim.”  Secrest had claimed her use of Fosamax from 1998 to 2005 caused her to develop ONJ, and that she also suffered other injuries in her jaw and oral cavity.  In his 42-page decision, Keenan said there was no evidence that Secrest’s prescribing doctor would have told her to stop using Fosamax in 2004 and 2005, at the time of her alleged injury, had Merck included a warning on its label.  The judge also said punitive damages were inappropriate because no reasonable jury could conclude that Merck breached any legal duty either intentionally or with a “conscious disregard or indifference” to its customers’ health.  Merck’s sales of Fosamax fell to $926 million in 2010 from $3.05 billion in 2007, prior to the start of generic sales.  The case is Secrest v.

Merck’s sales of Fosamax fell to $926 million in 2010 from $3.05 billion in 2007, prior to the start of generic sales.   The case is Secrest v.

63,MRK,Pain for NuPathe stock as migraine patch rejected,"BANGALORE (Reuters) - NuPathe Inc’s PATH.O experimental migraine patch — Zelrix — was rejected by U.S. health regulators on Tuesday, sending its shares down to a life-low and pushing back the launch of its key product by at least 6 months.  The Conshohocken, Pennsylvania-based company’s stock tumbled 49 percent to $1.89 on Tuesday morning making it the biggest loser on Nasdaq, as investors worried about the treatment’s future and costs associated with additional trials.  The company, which was planning to launch the patch in the first half of 2012, said the U.S. Food & Drug Administration raised questions on the patch’s chemistry, manufacturing and safety in a complete response letter.  “My estimate is that this will delay the approval for Zelrix probably by 6 months,” Wedbush Securities analyst Liana Moussatos told Reuters.  NuPathe, which focuses on diseases of the central nervous system, including schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease, said it may have to conduct additional early-stage and/or non-clinical studies to answer some of the questions raised by the FDA.  “It maybe a pre-clinical or a toxicology study that the FDA wants done or has a question about, but not a long study that would require lots of patients to fulfill a safety database,” analyst Moussatos said.  She added that the FDA’s acknowledgement of the patch’s efficacy suggests the company would not have to conduct a late-stage trial.  Zelrix is a single-use patch that quickly delivers GlaxoSmithKline’s (GSK.L) sumatriptan, which is also available generically, through the patient’s skin using an electric current.  In 2008, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) recalled its pain patch Ionsys, which used the same technology as Zelrix, from European markets, after a potential risk of drug overdose.  Moussatos said NuPathe’s patch is being designed to target a niche population that suffers from migraine side effects of nausea and vomiting and have a hard time swallowing a pill.  “I don’t see it taking a huge market share because it is a patch, but all the doctors that I talked to at the American Headache Society meeting said about 5 percent of their patients like patches and prefer them,” Moussatos said, estimating peak sales of $300 million.  GlaxoSmithKline’s Imitrex, Merck’s (MRK.N) Maxalt, AstraZeneca’s (AZN.L) Zomig and Pfizer’s (PFE.N) Relpax are among leading medicines currently on the market for migraine.  NuPathe said it has, or shortly will have, sufficient data to address the issues. It had submitted a new drug application for Zelrix in October 2010.  The company, which has a market cap of $53.64 million, will also request a meeting with the FDA to discuss the letter and its approach to resolve the issues.  Analyst Moussatos said the company is likely to meet the FDA in 30-45 days.  Migraine is a neurological disorder that affects about 30 million adults in the United States, NuPathe said.

64,MRK,UPDATE 1-FDA warns of allergy risk with Merck antipsychotic," * Doctors should monitor patients for reactions-FDA   * Drug’s label changed to warn of allergy risk   LOS ANGELES, Sept 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned on Thursday that serious allergic reactions have been reported with the use of Merck & Co Inc’s (MRK.N) antipsychotic drug Saphris.   The agency said the drug’s label has been revised to include information about the risk.   Saphris, first approved in 2009, is used to treat symptoms of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.   Doctors should closely monitor patients for reactions including anaphylaxis, swelling, low blood pressure and swollen tongue, the FDA said in a notice on its website.   The agency said Saphris should not be used in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the drug and patients should seek emergency medical attention if they develop any signs and symptoms of a serious allergic reaction while taking Saphris.

65,MRK,Superbug structure model seen boosting drug search," * Superbug enzyme NDM-1 is spreading around the world   * New knowledge of structure should intensify search for drugs    LONDON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Scientists have deciphered the structure of NDM-1, a vicious form of bacteria resistant to even the most powerful class of antibiotics, and built a model to help drug researchers in the hunt for more effective medicines.	   In a study published on Tuesday, researchers from the Medical Research Council’s (MRC) research complex at Harwell,  central England, said the discovery of the structure of NDM-1 — or New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 — was a crucial step in understanding how it worked and finding new ways to fight it.	   NDM-1 makes bacteria resistant to almost all antibiotics, including the most powerful class, carbapenems. It emerged in India more than three years ago and has spread across the world.  	   The enzyme has the ability to break up, or hydrolyse, an antibiotic and make it ineffective. It has been found in a wide variety of bugs, including familiar pathogens such as Escherichia coli, or E. coli. 	   “NDM-1 is a serious threat to human health. The enzyme it carries is able to degrade many forms of antibiotic and render them useless,” Simon Phillips, director of the research complex,  said in his study.	   “In addition, the gene for NDM-1 can be passed between different bacteria so can spread rapidly in the population and generate drug resistance in different diseases.”	   His findings were published in the online journal Acta Crystallographica Section F: Structural Biology and Crystallization Communications.	   In recent years, there has been growing concern that the usefulness of antibiotics could be coming to an end as the bacteria that cause disease become increasingly resistant to these drugs. 	   More than 25,000 people in the European Union die every year from bacterial infections able to outsmart even the newest and most powerful antibiotics.	   No new drugs are on the horizon to tackle NDM-1 for at least five or six years, and some scientists are concerned that only a few major drug companies, such as Pfizer , Merck , GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca , have strong antibiotic drug development programmes.	   “Identifying the structure of NDM-1 is a crucial step towards ensuring drug development is based on a sound understanding of the mechanisms of bacterial resistance to antibiotics,” said Sharon Peacock, a member of MRC’s infections and immunity board.

68,MRK,Positive hep C drug results boost Pharmasset shares,"(Reuters) - Pharmasset Inc said its hepatitis C shot showed positive results in a trial involving patients who have not been previously treated for the infection, sending its shares to a life-high on Tuesday morning.  In a mid-stage trial named PROTON, 98 percent of patients achieved sustained virologic response (SVR), or no detectable virus levels in their blood, 12 weeks after the treatment was completed.  Patients were given either 400 mg or 200 mg doses of the drug, PSI-7977, once daily for 12 weeks in combination with the current standard-of-care for hepatitis C — peginterferon alfa 2a and ribavirin.  “We continue to like Pharmasset’s prospect as the nucleotide leader in hepatitis C virus,” William Blair & Co analyst Katherine Xu said and raised her price target on the drugmaker’s stock to $73 from $71.  In March, Pharmasset’s mericitabine showed a 24 percent relapse rate at the European Association for the Study of the Liver Conference, sparking concerns about the potency of drugs such as PSI-7977 that belong to the nucleotide class.  However, the zero potency shown by PSI-7977 “clears the cloud above nucleotides,” she added.  Hepatitis C affects about 300 million people worldwide, causing 8,000-10,000 deaths each year due to chronic liver disease caused by the virus.  Citigroup’s Yaron Werber said the company was his “top pick” and maintained a price target of $100 on the stock.  Pharmasset, which competes with Merck & Co and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc in the multibillion-dollar hepatitis C market, said patients will now be monitored for virus levels 24 weeks after treatment completion, which is the main goal of the study.  Vertex’s Incivek won U.S. approval in May, and by July was reported to have garnered blockbuster sales. Merck’s Victrelis, which was given the nod in May to be marketed in Europe and the United States, is expected to touch sales of $1 billion.  Shares of the company, which rose 9 percent to a life-high of $69.90 on Tuesday morning, pared some of their gains to trade up 6 percent at $68.23 on Nasdaq.

The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence said there was “great uncertainty” about how well it worked as a add-on to other treatments for COPD, or smoker’s lung, and it was not able to establish whether the drug was worth using on the state health service.	   Draft guidance from the watchdog recommended setting up a further clinical trial to assess the pill, also known as roflumilast, as an add-on to triple or dual therapy for people with bad chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).	   “While we recognise it is important for people with severe COPD to have a range of options, NICE has to ensure that the NHS (National Health Service) provides treatments which are effective and value for money,” said NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre Director Carole Longson.	   “We hope a clinical study would generate robust evidence so that we can be clear about the benefits roflumilast brings for these patients.”	   Japan’s largest drugmaker Takeda Pharmaceutical  agreed to buy privately held Nycomed for 9.6 billion euros  ($13.5 billion) in May, partly to gain access to the newly approved medicine.

72,MRK,FDA advisers wary of time limit on bone drugs,"ADELPHI, Maryland (Reuters) - U.S. health advisers declined to suggest how long women should take a class of drugs used by millions to prevent bone fractures, but agreed the labels should be changed to reflect uncertainty about the risks and benefits of long-term use.  The Food and Drug Administration had asked two of its advisory panels to recommend whether a “drug holiday” or some time limit was warranted on a class of osteoporosis drugs known as bisphosphonates that have been linked to unusual thigh fractures and other side effects.  Instead, the advisers voted 17-6 on Friday to make changes to the labeling with many in favor of specifying how often patients need a re-evaluation of whether they need the medicine.  Panelists repeatedly raised concerns that they did not have enough evidence to come up with specific suggestions or conclusions, and some recommended raising awareness of such uncertainties in the label as well.  “I don’t think we have enough data to restrict anything at this point,” said Dr. Maria Suarez-Almazor, professor at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and a panel member.  The drugs under review include Merck & Co’s Fosamax, Warner Chilcott’s Actonel, Roche’s Boniva and Novartis’ Reclast. This class of drugs has also been linked to osteonecrosis of the jaw, or jaw bone death, and a possible higher cancer risk.  Studies presented by the FDA and the industry did not paint a conclusive picture to estimate whether benefits outweigh the risks in taking bisphosphonates for longer than three to five years or how exactly each of these drugs affects various subgroups of patients, advisers said.  “I’m used to dealing with ambiguity in a clinical setting, but this raises it to different heights,” said Brian Erstad, pharmacy professor at the University of Arizona and a member of the drug safety and risk management advisory panel.  Some 4.5 million Americans over the age of 55 filled prescriptions for bisphosphonates in 2009, predominantly women after menopause to prevent osteoporosis, a progressive bone-thinning condition that typically causes bone fractures in the hip, wrist or spine.  FDA staff said the use of the drugs is associated with unusual femur fractures, and the risk of jaw bone death may increase the longer people take them orally. But they said the evidence for an increased cancer risk was inconsistent.  Boniva is available as either an injection or a tablet, Reclast is an injection, and the other drugs are taken orally.  FDA researchers found no advantage in staying on the drugs beyond five years and no loss of efficacy from discontinuing their use. Drugmakers, however, warned that a sweeping imposition of an interruption in treatment by the FDA may leave patients vulnerable to more fractures.  “Despite rare side effects, those patients who take bisphosphonates have fewer fractures and lower mortality, and these findings need to be shared with our patients,” said Dr. Robert Adler, an invited speaker and endocrinology professor at the Virginia Commonwealth University.  With millions taking the medication, the sales of Merck’s Fosamax reached $3 billion in 2007 but revenue plunged to $926 million by 2010 with the pill facing competition from cheaper generics beginning in early 2008.  Analysts have said mounting concerns about bisphosphonates may drive patients to Amgen Inc’s new medicine, Prolia, a different type of osteoporosis drug.  Orrel Lanter took Merck’s Fosamax and its generic version, known chemically as alendronate, for nine years.  “I felt something go ‘snap’ in my leg. My right foot flopped out to the right and my leg became a noodle, the pain was excruciating,” she told the advisers on Friday. At the emergency room, she was told she had an atypical femur fracture that she attributes to years of taking bisphosphonates.  “I was a happy healthy, very active outdoors woman now left crippled because of this awful drug,” said Lanter, who is now 68 and walked out of the room using a cane.  Since Merck’s Fosamax became the first bisphosphonate to get approval for osteoporosis in 1995, the labels for the drugs in this class have undergone multiple reviews and changes.  In 2005, a warning of higher risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw was added to labels, and in 2009, a caution about adverse gastrointestinal reactions. Earlier this year, the labels were changed to add a warning of atypical femur fractures and Reclast’s label now mentions a higher risk of kidney failure.  Still, drugmakers and some of the panelists agreed that some groups of patients, perhaps those at highest risk of bone fractures, could benefit from longer-term use of such drugs.  Whether and how to address these issues is now up to the FDA.  ",9092011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-osteoporosis-drugs-fda/fda-advisers-wary-of-time-limit-on-bone-drugs-idUSTRE7885LZ20110909

Two U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panels were jointly meeting on Friday over whether to recommend a “drug holiday” or otherwise clarify how long people should take a class of osteoporosis drugs known as bisphosphonates.   These drugs include Merck & Co’s (MRK.N) Fosamax, Warner Chilcott’s WCRX.O Actonel, Roche’s ROG.VX Boniva and Novartis’ NOVN.VX (NVS.N) Reclast.

But they said the evidence for an increased cancer risk was inconsistent.   No advantage exists in staying on the drug beyond five years, FDA researchers said.   “In light of the risk-benefit challenges, the available data suggest that therapy can be safely discontinued without the loss of efficacy,” said Dr. Marcea Whitaker, an FDA medical officer from the reproductive and urologic drugs division. “However, additional data are needed to further define an appropriate duration of drug cessation.”   Some 4.5 million Americans over the age of 55 filled prescriptions for bisphosphonates in 2009. The medicines are commonly taken for osteoporosis, a progressive bone-thinning condition that typically causes bone fractures in the hip, wrist or spine.

Just last month, a federal judge threw out part of a bellwether lawsuit against Merck, but said the plaintiff could pursue her claim that Merck’s Fosamax had a design defect and caused her jawbone tissue to die.   Still, bisphosphonates remain a widely-used treatment option for women facing a risk of bone fractures.   “I have to tell my patients that we have no magic bullet, that our drugs decrease the risk of fracture but we have nothing that eliminates fracture,” said Dr. Robert Adler, an invited speaker at the advisory meeting and endocrinology professor at the Virginia Commonwealth University.   “Despite rare side effects, those patients who take bisphosphonates have fewer fractures and lower mortality, and these findings need to be shared with our patients,” he said.   Makers of the drugs emphasized that studies have not directly linked or explained the connection between their medicines and adverse side effects. They voiced concerns about the lack of data on what happens to patients who go off treatment and suggested “drug holiday” decisions are best done for each patient individually.   “A drug holiday may be appropriate for some patients, but that decision should be based on an individual risk-benefit basis, and a physician is in the best position to make that decision overall,” said Joseph Kohles, international medical leader for Boniva at Roche.

75,MRK,PREVIEW-Lofty hopes confront Gilead's 4-drug HIV pill," * Key trial results expected this month   * May need to show superiority to rivals to boost stock   * Sales forecasts vary widely   By Deena Beasley   LOS ANGELES, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc’s (GILD.O) experimental four-drug HIV pill may need to do more than simply match the safety and effectiveness of existing therapies to meet its lofty sales expectations.   Results for the second pivotal clinical trial for the combination drug are expected this month. The pill is likely to meet the study’s goal of working as well as a combination of other medicines, analysts said, but it may need to show superiority to convince investors of its commercial potential and send Gilead shares higher.   The biotechnology company said in August that its first pivotal trial of the pill, known as the Quad, met the goal of showing that it worked as well as Atripla, Gilead’s current three-drug combination HIV pill.   But shares of the Foster City, California-based company fell as much as 3 percent after the news and the stock has dropped more than 10 percent over the past seven weeks.   “There were some investors who were hoping the trial would show superiority to Atripla,” said Needham & Co analyst Alan Carr.   The Quad is seen as Gilead’s most important pipeline product — all of the components are owned by the company, and the Quad would extend the life of the company’s lucrative HIV franchise.   As of early 2011, about 80 percent of U.S. HIV patients and 72 percent of European HIV patients were treated with a Gilead drug. Combination drugs are particularly important for HIV patients, who must juggle a huge amount of pills on a daily basis.   The Quad combines experimental integrase inhibitor elvitegravir and boosting agent cobicistat with Truvada, a pill consisting of Gilead’s older HIV drugs Emtriva and Viread.   Most of the company’s current drug sales — which totaled $7.4 billion last year — come from Atripla, a once-daily pill that combines Truvada with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY.N) Sustiva.   Gilead earns no profit from the Bristol drug, and all of the Atripla components lose patent protection in the next few years.   The second pivotal trial of the Quad is designed to show that it works as well as a combination of ritonavir-boosted Reyataz, a protease inhibitor sold by Bristol-Myers, and Truvada.   RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee puts the odds that the Quad will show superiority to the Reyataz regimen at 25 percent.   A lower-cost generic version of Atripla could be on the market in 2018, and Gilead will need a compelling case to convince doctors that the Quad will benefit patients more than existing HIV drugs.   If approved, the Quad would be the first single-tablet regimen for HIV to include an integrase inhibitor — a new class of drugs designed to block the ability of the human immunodeficiency virus to replicate.   The four-drug pill is also seen as potentially safer than Atripla, but Gilead said initial results from the first pivotal trial showed similar rates of adverse side effects and patient drop-out rates for both treatment groups.   Full safety data from the first trial will be presented at a medical conference in March, and Gilead plans to file for U.S. regulatory approval of the Quad in the first quarter of 2012.   U.S. regulators last month approved Gilead’s Complera, a  three-drug combination of Emtriva, Viread and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) Edurant. Under its deal with J&J, Gilead will keep up to 30 percent of what it makes off the Edurant component.   Analysts expect Gilead’s Complera sales to reach $916 million by 2015, according to Thomson Reuters data. Sales of the Quad are forecast as high as $1.53 billion by 2015, but estimates vary widely.   “While Gilead remains the dominant market leader in HIV ... we believe the overall market trends are slowing and that trends toward earlier treatment have been close to fully realized,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Jim Birchenough said in a research note this week.   He forecasts 2015 Quad sales of just $367.3 million.   Gilead licensed elvitegravir from Japan Tobacco Inc (2914.T) in March 2005. The U.S. company has exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the drug everywhere except Japan.   Currently, the only integrase inhibitor approved by regulators is Merck & Co Inc’s (MRK.N) Isentress, or raltegravir, but it must be taken twice a day.   ViiV Healthcare, a joint venture between GlaxoSmithkline Plc (GSK.L) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), is testing a combination of experimental integrase inhibitor dolutegravir and Epzicom, which consists of HIV drugs Ziagen and Epivir.   Yee at RBC Capital Markets said the Glaxo drug could be competition for the Quad, but noted that dolutegravir will not be co-formulated with Truvada.   He also said Epzicom use is associated with higher cardiovascular risks.

76,MRK,FDA advisers wary of time limit on bone drugs,"ADELPHI, Maryland (Reuters) - U.S. health advisers declined to suggest how long women should take a class of drugs used by millions to prevent bone fractures, but agreed the labels should be changed to reflect uncertainty about the risks and benefits of long-term use.  The Food and Drug Administration had asked two of its advisory panels to recommend whether a “drug holiday” or some time limit was warranted on a class of osteoporosis drugs known as bisphosphonates that have been linked to unusual thigh fractures and other side effects.  Instead, the advisers voted 17-6 on Friday to make changes to the labeling with many in favor of specifying how often patients need a re-evaluation of whether they need the medicine.  Panelists repeatedly raised concerns that they did not have enough evidence to come up with specific suggestions or conclusions, and some recommended raising awareness of such uncertainties in the label as well.  “I don’t think we have enough data to restrict anything at this point,” said Dr. Maria Suarez-Almazor, professor at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and a panel member.  The drugs under review include Merck & Co’s Fosamax, Warner Chilcott’s Actonel, Roche’s Boniva and Novartis’ Reclast. This class of drugs has also been linked to osteonecrosis of the jaw, or jaw bone death, and a possible higher cancer risk.  Studies presented by the FDA and the industry did not paint a conclusive picture to estimate whether benefits outweigh the risks in taking bisphosphonates for longer than three to five years or how exactly each of these drugs affects various subgroups of patients, advisers said.  “I’m used to dealing with ambiguity in a clinical setting, but this raises it to different heights,” said Brian Erstad, pharmacy professor at the University of Arizona and a member of the drug safety and risk management advisory panel.  Some 4.5 million Americans over the age of 55 filled prescriptions for bisphosphonates in 2009, predominantly women after menopause to prevent osteoporosis, a progressive bone-thinning condition that typically causes bone fractures in the hip, wrist or spine.  FDA staff said the use of the drugs is associated with unusual femur fractures, and the risk of jaw bone death may increase the longer people take them orally. But they said the evidence for an increased cancer risk was inconsistent.  Boniva is available as either an injection or a tablet, Reclast is an injection, and the other drugs are taken orally.  FDA researchers found no advantage in staying on the drugs beyond five years and no loss of efficacy from discontinuing their use. Drugmakers, however, warned that a sweeping imposition of an interruption in treatment by the FDA may leave patients vulnerable to more fractures.  “Despite rare side effects, those patients who take bisphosphonates have fewer fractures and lower mortality, and these findings need to be shared with our patients,” said Dr. Robert Adler, an invited speaker and endocrinology professor at the Virginia Commonwealth University.  With millions taking the medication, the sales of Merck’s Fosamax reached $3 billion in 2007 but revenue plunged to $926 million by 2010 with the pill facing competition from cheaper generics beginning in early 2008.  Analysts have said mounting concerns about bisphosphonates may drive patients to Amgen Inc’s new medicine, Prolia, a different type of osteoporosis drug.  Orrel Lanter took Merck’s Fosamax and its generic version, known chemically as alendronate, for nine years.  “I felt something go ‘snap’ in my leg. My right foot flopped out to the right and my leg became a noodle, the pain was excruciating,” she told the advisers on Friday. At the emergency room, she was told she had an atypical femur fracture that she attributes to years of taking bisphosphonates.  “I was a happy healthy, very active outdoors woman now left crippled because of this awful drug,” said Lanter, who is now 68 and walked out of the room using a cane.  Since Merck’s Fosamax became the first bisphosphonate to get approval for osteoporosis in 1995, the labels for the drugs in this class have undergone multiple reviews and changes.  In 2005, a warning of higher risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw was added to labels, and in 2009, a caution about adverse gastrointestinal reactions. Earlier this year, the labels were changed to add a warning of atypical femur fractures and Reclast’s label now mentions a higher risk of kidney failure.  Still, drugmakers and some of the panelists agreed that some groups of patients, perhaps those at highest risk of bone fractures, could benefit from longer-term use of such drugs.  Whether and how to address these issues is now up to the  ",9102011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-osteoporosis-drugs-fda/fda-advisers-wary-of-time-limit-on-bone-drugs-idUSTRE7885LZ20110910
77,MRK,Coils almost halve risk of cervical cancer: study,"LONDON (Reuters) - Contrary to popular belief, coil contraceptive devices might actually protect women against developing cervical cancer even though they don’t stop the infection that commonly leads to the disease, according to the results of an international study.  While coils are unlikely to be recommended as way of preventing cervical cancer — the second most common form of cancer in women worldwide — the research should reassure women and their doctors that using them carries no added risk of the disease.  Spanish researchers who studied 20,000 women found that those with a history of using coils, or intrauterine devices (IUDs), were no less likely than women who don’t to contract the human papillomavirus (HPV) that causes cervical cancer, but they had only around half the risk of developing the cancer itself.  The scientists think possible explanations for the protective effect of coils could be that the process of inserting or removing them destroys pre-cancerous cells, or that it causes some kind of inflammation that prompts a long-lasting immune response and prevents the HPV from progressing.  “It was a little unexpected,” Xavier Castellsague of the cancer epidemiological research programme at the Llobregat Hospital in Catalonia said in a telephone interview. “The data (available) before we did this study were very inconsistent, so we didn’t expect to find such a strong association with this protective effect.”  Cancer of the cervix is the second most common cancer in women across the world, with about 500,000 new cases and 250,000 deaths each year, according to the World Health Organization.  Virtually all cervical cancer cases are linked to genital infection with HPV, which is the most common viral infection of the reproductive tract.  Drugmakers Merck and GlaxoSmithKline have vaccines that protect against HPV and many wealthy and some developing countries have started nationwide immunization programmes for girls to prevent more cases of cervical cancer.  A coil is a plastic and copper or hormone-containing contraceptive device that is placed in the uterus to prevent sperm from joining with an egg.  Previous studies have shown that using coils can protect women against another type of cancer called endometrial cancer, but until now it was not clear whether they could also have an affect on the risk of cervical cancer.  Castellsague’s team, whose study was published in the Lancet Oncology journal on Tuesday, analyzed data from 10 case-control studies of cervical cancer done in eight countries and 16 HPV prevalence surveys in women from four continents. The findings were adjusted for the number of sexual partners and other confounding factors.  The results show that coil use did not affect the risk of HPV infection, but was linked to a markedly lower risk of cervix cancer for both major types of the disease — reducing the likelihood of developing squamous-cell carcinoma by 44 percent and adenocarcinoma or adenosquamous carcinoma by 54 percent.  The length of time that women used a coil did not significantly alter the risk, the researchers said. They found the risk was reduced by nearly half in the first year of use and the protective effect remained significant even after 10 years.  “IUDs are not inert devices,” Castellsague said. “Our speculation is that they act as a foreign body and stimulate inflammatory changes that prevent the HPV infection from persisting and progressing to more advanced stages.”  ",9122011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cancer-cervical-coils/coils-almost-halve-risk-of-cervical-cancer-study-idUSTRE78B71S20110912

79,MRK,Interim analysis of Merck's Vytorin trial delayed," * Second interim analysis of IMPROVE-IT trial delayed   * Merck CFO says delay is due to scheduling event   * Says delay will not affect overall review time   Sept 13 (Reuters) - Merck & Co (MRK.N) said on Tuesday an interim analysis of a clinical trial of its cholesterol drug Vytorin will be delayed, though the company’s chief financial officer said the delay would not affect the overall timing of its regulatory review.   Whitehouse Station, New Jersey-based Merck said the executive committee overseeing a trial known as IMPROVE-IT has scheduled the study’s second interim analysis for the first quarter of 2012, rather than late 2011, as previously anticipated.   Peter Kellogg, Merck’s CFO, said at the Morgan Stanley global healthcare conference that the delay is purely one of scheduling and will not affect overall timing of the trial, expected to be complete in 2013.   “That has not been part of the discussion so far,” he said.   Vytorin is a pill that combines two cholesterol-lowering drugs — Zocor, or simvastatin, and Zetia, or ezetimibe. It has been dogged by safety concerns for several years.   The IMPROVE-IT trial is testing whether Vytorin reduces major heart heart problems in patients with acute coronary syndrome, a term that describes chest pains, unstable angina and other symptoms caused by a sudden reduction in blood flow to the heart. The trial compares Vytorin to Zocor alone.

80,MRK,Perry targeted by rivals in Republican debate,"TAMPA, Florida (Reuters) - Republican Rick Perry came under heavy fire on Social Security, jobs and his Texas record in a heated U.S. presidential debate on Monday as rivals tried to halt the front-runner’s momentum.  The Texas governor, who has soared to the top of opinion polls in the Republican race, renewed his fight with challenger Mitt Romney over Social Security. They accused each other of frightening seniors about the popular retirement program.  Perry’s rivals questioned his claims about Texas job creation, his stance on illegal immigrants and an executive order he gave as governor, which he admitted was a mistake, that young girls be vaccinated for a sexually transmitted virus that causes cervical cancer.  The sharp exchanges and repeated focus on Perry reinforced his growing stature as the candidate to beat in the 2012 race for the nomination to challenge President Barack Obama.  Perry was on defense for much of the debate but did not become rattled or make a gaffe that could sidetrack his campaign. He eased back from controversial earlier comments on Social Security and the Federal Reserve while deflecting criticism where possible.  He softened his recent harsh criticism of the Social Security retirement program and said he wanted to start “a legitimate conversation” about its future. Perry launched the fight last week when he called Social Security a Ponzi scheme and a “monstrous lie.”  “The term Ponzi scheme I think is over the top and unnecessary and frightful to many people,” said Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, who pressed Perry on whether he still believed the retirement program should be shifted to the states and ended as a federal program.  “Rather than trying to scare seniors, like you’re doing and other people, it’s time to have a legitimate conversation about how to fix that program so it’s not bankrupt,” Perry said, promising to keep benefits for those who are now retired or close to it.  The Social Security debate will be watched closely in Florida, which has the country’s second-biggest proportion of elderly voters and hosts a crucial nominating contest next year.  “We’re frightening the American people, who just want solutions,” said Jon Huntsman, the former Utah governor, adding that Republicans could not win an election by promising to dismantle Social Security. “We’ve got the answers, we don’t have leaders,” he said.  Former U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich said he was not worried about Romney and Perry frightening seniors “when President Obama scares them every day.”  Perry, a conservative Tea Party favorite, has zoomed past Romney to lead polls since entering the race last month. He frequently drew applause from the crowd at the debate, co-sponsored by Tea Party groups that have reshaped the U.S. political scene with their focus on limited government and reduced spending.  U.S. Representative Michele Bachmann, whose campaign has faded badly in the last month after winning a straw poll in Iowa, targeted Perry over his executive order on the vaccine program in Texas.  She accused him of issuing the order because his former chief of staff was a lobbyist for Merck & Co, the company that made the drug.  “This is just flat-out wrong. The question is, is it about life, or was it about millions of dollars and potentially billions for a drug company?” asked Bachmann, who has seen Perry rob her of much of her religious and social conservative support.  Perry said Merck gave him a $5,000 donation. “If you’re saying that I can be bought for $5,000, I’m offended,” he said.  Bachmann shot back: “I’m offended for all the little girls and the parents who didn’t have a choice.”  Romney said Perry’s record on job creation in Texas, which has outpaced most other states in adding new jobs, was the result of Perry’s lack of an income tax, its broad natural resources and other factors rather than his policies.  “I think Governor Perry would agree with me that if you’re dealt four aces that doesn’t make you necessarily a great poker player,” Romney said.  U.S. Representative Ron Paul noted he was a resident of Texas and had seen his taxes go up and spending increase under Perry, while many of the jobs added were government jobs.  “So I would put a little damper on this, but I don’t want to offend the governor, because he might raise my taxes or something,” Paul said.  Perry tempered earlier comments targeting Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, but again said it would be “almost treasonous” to allow the central bank to be used for political purposes.  Those comments were turned back on him later during a discussion of his opposition to a border fence in Texas.  “For Rick to say you can’t secure the border is pretty much a treasonous comment,” Huntsman said.  Other candidates participating were businessman Herman Cain and former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum.  The debate was the fifth of the Republican presidential campaign. It will be followed by another debate next week in Orlando, Florida, as the White House race heats up.

82,MRK,"Breast, cervix cancer growing threats to poor: study","LONDON (Reuters) - The number of cases and deaths from breast and cervical cancer is rising in most countries across the world, especially in poorer nations where more women are dying at younger ages, according to a global study of the diseases.  Researchers from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington found breast cancer cases more than doubled around the world in just three decades, from 641,000 cases in 1980 to 1.6 million cases in 2010 — a pace that far exceeds global population growth.  During the same period, deaths from breast cancer rose from 250,000 a year to 425,000 a year — a much slower increase, suggesting that screening and treatment programs now common in wealthier countries are having a positive impact.  The number of cervical cancer cases rose from 378,000 cases in 1980 to 454,000 in 2010, and deaths from cervical cancer rose at almost the same pace as cases, according to the study published in The Lancet medical journal on Thursday.  “Women in high-income countries like the United States and the United Kingdom are benefiting from early cancer screenings, drug therapies, and vaccines,” said Rafael Lozano, a professor of global health at IHME who worked on the study. “We are seeing the burden of breast and cervical cancer shifting to low-income countries in Africa and Asia.”  He said this was one of the early signs of the emerging threat of so-called non-communicable or chronic diseases, in developing countries. “Everyone has been talking about that threat. Now the trend is clear,” he said.  The study found that since 1980, new cases and deaths from cervical cancer have increased mainly in south and east Asia, Latin America, and Africa, but have declined substantially in high-income countries, particularly in countries where widespread screening is available.  However, the disease still killed 200,000 women around the world in 2010, of whom 46,000 were from developing countries and were of reproductive age.  The researchers said the findings added urgency to calls from public health experts to world leaders to make cancer screening, treatment, and education a priority in poor nations.  The United Nations is holding a high-level meeting dedicated to chronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease, lung disease and diabetes in New York on September 19-20.  “If more women are developing breast and cervical cancer during their reproductive years, this adds more pressure on families and societies already suffering from high rates of infectious disease and child mortality,” said Mohammad Forouzanfar of the IHME, who led the study.  Breast and cervical screening programs have been in place in many rich countries for several decades, designed to catch cancers early and maximize the potential for effective treatment.  Many effective breast cancer treatments are also available to women in the rich world. More recently, national immunization programs using new vaccines from drugmakers Merck and GlaxoSmithKline have been launched to protect girls from the human papillomavirus (HPV) that causes almost all cervical cancers.

Researchers from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington found breast cancer cases more than doubled around the world in just three decades, from 641,000 cases in 1980 to 1.6 million cases in 2010 — a pace that far exceeds global population growth. 	   During the same period, deaths from breast cancer rose from 250,000 a year to 425,000 a year — a much slower increase, suggesting that screening and treatment programmes now common in wealthier countries are having a positive impact.	   The number of cervical cancer cases rose from 378,000 cases in 1980 to 454,000 in 2010, and deaths from cervical cancer rose at almost the same pace as cases, according to the study published in The Lancet medical journal on Thursday.	   “Women in high-income countries like the United States and the United Kingdom are benefiting from early cancer screenings, drug therapies, and vaccines,” said Rafael Lozano, a professor of global health at IHME who worked on the study. “We are seeing the burden of breast and cervical cancer shifting to low-income countries in Africa and Asia.”	   He said this was one of the early signs of the emerging threat of so-called non-communicable or chronic diseases, in developing countries. “Everyone has been talking about that threat. Now the trend is clear,” he said.	   The study found that since 1980, new cases and deaths from cervical cancer have increased mainly in south and east Asia, Latin America, and Africa, but have declined substantially in high-income countries, particularly in countries where widespread screening is available. 	   However, the disease still killed 200,000 women around the world in 2010, of whom 46,000 were from developing countries and were of reproductive age.	   The researchers said the findings added urgency to calls from public health experts to world leaders to make cancer screening, treatment, and education a priority in poor nations.

84,MRK,"Merck aims at hepatitis, c. difficile drugs","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The head of infectious diseases at Merck & Co said the company’s future all-oral treatments for hepatitis C and its experimental drug for infections with clostridium difficile bacteria could transform treatment and reap big sales.  Merck and biotechnology company Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc earlier this year introduced rival new oral treatments for hepatitis C that work by blocking the protein protease. But they both must be taken with an injectable interferon that prolongs treatment and causes flu-like side effects.  Roger Pomerantz, who was named head of Merck’s infectious disease segment last year, estimated the highly effective new hepatitis C drugs target only about 10 million to 15 million people in developed countries and some emerging markets.  By contrast, he said a newer all-oral treatment regimen that eliminates interferon could target as many as 180 million patients globally, including those in remote and rural regions of Africa and South America.  “We’re at just the tip of the iceberg” with current treatments, he said in an interview on Wednesday. “The big change will be when we can provide a simple, compact all-oral regimen.”  “Hepatitis C is arguably the largest market opportunity in infectious diseases in my lifetime because of the sheer numbers and the fact that we can cure it,” said Pomerantz, who headed Johnson & Johnson’s infectious disease division before being hired away by Merck.  Pomerantz said the company also has high hopes for a new way of fighting clostridium difficile (c. difficile), bacteria which are spread in hospitals and are most dangerous for the elderly and others with weakened immune systems.  The sometimes-deadly infections occur in patients who have been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics that kill off “friendly” bacteria in the gut, allowing clostridium difficile to take root and prosper there. They cause colitis, including attacks of diarrhea and fever that can recur and are not well-controlled by current treatments.  “Over the past five years there has been a new hyper-virulent strain that is more deadly than the usual c. difficile, so we have a perfect storm” situation, Pomerantz said.  Merck’s treatment reduced the rate of recurring attacks by more than 70 percent in mid-stage trials, Pomerantz said.  The company hopes to launch the new drug in 2013 or 2014, Pomerantz said. It is a combination of two monoclonal antibodies that block toxins produced by c. difficile.

86,MRK,"Analysis: Bachmann vaccine comments toxic, doctors say","CHICAGO (Reuters) - No matter how much the U.S. medical community repudiates the suggestion by presidential candidate Michele Bachmann that a vaccine for human papillomavirus (HPV) is dangerous, doctors fear the damage has already been done.  Physicians are bracing for more parents to refuse the HPV vaccine, which protects against the most common cause of cervical cancer, for their daughters.  They say the comments by the Republican candidate will only stoke growing and unfounded fears about a whole class of common immunizations needed to fight disease.  “There are people out there who, because of this kind of misinformation, aren’t going to get their daughter immunized,” said Dr. Kenneth Alexander, a pediatric infectious disease expert at the University of Chicago Medical Center.  “As a result, there will be more people who die from cervical cancer,” Alexander said in a telephone interview.  Dr. Mary Anne Jackson, an infectious disease expert at Children’s Mercy Hospital & Clinics in Kansas City, Missouri, said doctors are already struggling to convince parents to immunize girls against HPV, a sexually transmitted virus.  “There will be repercussions of this comment that will directly impact every provider who takes care of adolescents and young women,” Jackson said in a telephone interview.  Bachmann first raised the issue during a Republican presidential debate on Monday as a swipe at Republican rival and Texas Governor Rick Perry, who issued an executive order in 2007 mandating girls get the HPV vaccine as part of a school immunization requirement. The order was later overturned.  In that forum, she questioned the state’s authority to force “innocent little 12-year-old girls” to have a “government injection” that was “potentially dangerous.”  The following day, she told NBC’s “Today” show the story of a woman from Tampa, Florida, who approached her after the debate and said her daughter became “mentally retarded” after getting the Gardasil vaccine made by Merck.  Physician groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) rushed out statements defending the safety of Merck’s vaccine and Cervarix made by GlaxoSmithKline, whose most common side effects include a sore arm, a rash and fever.  As a measure of their incredulity over Bachmann’s comments, two bioethicists are offering rewards, one of more than $10,000, if she can bring forward the child who suffered irreparable damage.  The AAP says there is absolutely no scientific validity to Bachmann’s statement that the HPV vaccine is potentially dangerous.  “Since the vaccine has been introduced (in 2006), more than 35 million doses have been administered, and it has an excellent safety record,” Dr. O. Marion Burton, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement.  But no amount of proof will suffice for some families, who fear that even a small percentage of children may be harmed.  “I recently had a mother who had cervical cancer who refused the HPV vaccine for her child,” Jackson said. “I asked her where she got her information and she said, ‘the Internet, and innuendo.’”  That may help explain the slow uptake of the HPV vaccine. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only 32 percent of adolescent girls last year had gotten all three shots of the HPV vaccine.  “We’ve got 12,000 women a year in this country getting cervical cancer. The vaccine could prevent about 70 percent of that,” Alexander said.  Vaccine fears have already fueled recent outbreaks of measles, mumps and whooping cough, according to the CDC.  Much of the fear stemmed from a study by Dr. Andrew Wakefield, the now-disgraced British doctor who researchers believe falsified data for a 1998 study which convinced thousands of parents that vaccines are dangerous.  Concerns that vaccines might cause autism have not only caused parents to skip vaccinating their children, but also forced costly reformulations of many vaccines.  Bachmann’s suggestion that the HPV vaccine may be linked with “mental retardation” only feeds into those fears.  “What is especially disturbing is you’ve got organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists — every learned medical organization in the country and indeed around the world — in favor of immunization,” Alexander of the University of Chicago said.  Jackson said when presented with information about the HPV vaccine, about 85 percent of families decide to have their child vaccinated, about 12 percent are hesitant, and the rest are “flat-out refusers.”  It’s the families in that 12 percent she is worried about.  “It’s not going to impact the flat-out refusers. I worry it is going to impact this group of vaccine-hesitant families.”  ",9152011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cancer-hpv/analysis-bachmann-vaccine-comments-toxic-doctors-say-idUSTRE78E5YM20110915

89,MRK,Analysis: Bachmann may be Romney's top asset in race,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Presidential candidate Michele Bachmann’s scathing attacks on Rick Perry may be hurting the front-runner for the 2012 Republican nomination, and raising questions about her own judgment, but they are also helping another of her rivals — Mitt Romney.  Once among the leaders, the Minnesota congresswoman lately has been stumbling badly in the race for her party’s presidential nomination to run against Democratic President Barack Obama in 2012.  Top advisers have resigned, her poll numbers have been dropping and Bachmann has not attracted the big donors she would need to mount a credible 2012 campaign against Democratic President Barack Obama, whom some say will amass a $1 billion campaign warchest.  But she has no immediate plans to drop out, making her campaign an asset for former Massachusetts governor Romney, who has slipped from front-runner to second place since Perry launched his presidential bid last month.  “The net result of everything she is doing is making it more likely that Romney will be the nominee,” Matt Mackowiak, a Republican strategist who worked on George W. Bush’s 2004 campaign and who has donated to Perry.  Bachmann scored points against Perry — boosting Romney — in a debate on Monday night by questioning the Texas governor’s conservative credentials over his order requiring that adolescent girls be vaccinated for viruses that cause cancer, with a vaccine sold by Merck & Co, a Perry donor.  She also blasted Perry for allowing illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition rates at state colleges.  Republican strategist Ford O’Connell said Bachmann had “peeled off” some support for Perry on the sensitive vaccine and immigration issues, and that he expected those attacks would continue.  “I think that she is grasping at straws right now and I do think that if she grabs the right one and hangs on, she could be around for a while,” O’Connell said.  The focus quickly shifted to Bachmann’s own penchant for verbal gaffes after the debate, when she linked the vaccine to “mental retardation,” a claim scientists called irresponsible and baseless, fueling talk that she may be flaming out.  Bachmann was hit by a firestorm of criticism after her remarks. The influential conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh said she may have “jumped the shark” — slang for nearing the end of an effort — with the vaccinations comment.  “Her really only path to the nomination now is to take out Rick Perry,” O’Connell said.  Perry is well ahead, supported by an average of 31 percent in the Republican nomination race, to 20 percent for Romney and just 7 percent for Bachmann, according to polls compiled by RealClearPolitics.com.  But while Bachmann is in the race, she is keeping supporters who likely would otherwise support Perry, not the relatively moderate Romney.  “The biggest threat that she poses to Rick Perry is not because she necessarily displaces him in any way, but because he is going to have two people fighting against him,” said Jennifer Lawless, director of the Women in Politics Institute at American University in Washington.  Bachmann in particular still has pockets of strong support, as in Iowa, where social conservatives play a big role in Republican politics and where she won the closely watched Ames straw poll in August.  “I think the fact that Michele was willing to go on stage at the debate and go on the attack is a good thing,” said Ryan Rhodes, a leader with the Iowa Tea Party, who said he was unhappy about Perry’s position on immigration.  Bachmann was in California, home to many wealthy political donors, on Friday, but her campaign said she would be focusing primarily on Iowa, whose caucuses in February are the first binding votes of the nomination season.  Strategists said focusing on the small but important state made sense for the Bachmann team, which is burning through money quickly because her campaign favors highly orchestrated and expensive events.  Although known as a prolific fundraiser in Congress — she topped all House lawmakers in 2010 — Bachmann has never attracted big-dollar donors.  More than two-thirds of her donations in the second quarter came in increments of $200 or less. The third quarter is expected to be challenging for Bachmann.  Stan Hubbard, a Bachmann supporter who owns KSTP-TV in St. Paul, Minnesota, said he had raised money for her in the past, but had not been called recently.  “They haven’t called and it is going to be tough to raise money,” Hubbard said.

91,MRK,"Scientists find way to ""disarm"" AIDS virus","LONDON (Reuters) - Scientists have found a way to prevent HIV from damaging the immune system and say their discovery may offer a new approach to developing a vaccine against AIDS.  Researchers from the United States and Europe working in laboratories on the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) found it is unable to damage the immune system if cholesterol is removed from the virus’s membrane.  “It’s like an army that has lost its weapons but still has flags, so another army can recognize it and attack it,” said Adriano Boasso of Imperial College London, who led the study.  The team now plans to investigate how to use this way of inactivating the virus and possibly develop it into a vaccine.  Usually when a person becomes infected with HIV, the body’s innate immune response puts up an immediate defense. But some researchers believe HIV causes the innate immune system to overreact. This weakens the immune system’s next line of defense, known as the adaptive immune response.  For this study — published on Monday in the journal Blood — Boasso’s team removed cholesterol from the membrane around the virus and found that this stopped HIV from triggering the innate immune response. This in turn led to a stronger adaptive response, orchestrated by a type of immune cells called T cells.  AIDS kills around 1.8 million people a year worldwide. An estimated 2.6 million people caught HIV in 2009, and 33.3 million people are living with the virus.  Major producers of current HIV drugs include Gilead Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck, Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline.  Scientists from companies, non-profits and governments around the world have been trying for many years to make a vaccine against HIV but have so far had only limited success.  A 2009 study in Thailand involving 16,000 volunteers showed for the first time that a vaccine could prevent HIV infection in a small number of people, but since the efficacy was only around 30 percent researchers were forced back to the drawing board.  An American team working on an experimental HIV vaccine said in May that it helped monkeys with a form of the AIDS virus control the infection for more than a year, suggesting it may lead to a vaccine for people.  HIV is spread in many ways — during sex, on needles shared by drug users, in breast milk and in blood — so there is no single easy way to prevent infection. The virus also mutates quickly and can hide from the immune system, and attacks the very cells sent to battle it.  “HIV is very sneaky,” Boasso said in a statement. “It evades the host’s defenses by triggering overblown responses that damage the immune system. It’s like revving your car in first gear for too long — eventually the engine blows out.  He said this may be why developing a vaccine has proven so tricky. “Most vaccines prime the adaptive response to recognize the invader, but it’s hard for this to work if the virus triggers other mechanisms that weaken the adaptive response.”  HIV takes its membrane from the cell that it infects, the researchers explained in their study. This membrane contains cholesterol, which helps keep it fluid and enables it to interact with particular types of cell.  Normally, a subset of immune cells called plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) recognize HIV quickly and react by producing signaling molecules called interferons. These signals activate various processes which are initially helpful, but which damage the immune system if switched on for too long.  Working with scientists Johns Hopkins University, the University of Milan and Innsbruck University, Boasso’s team found that if cholesterol is removed from HIV’s envelope, it can no longer activate pDCs. As a result, T cells, which orchestrate the adaptive response, can fight the virus more effectively.",9192011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-aids-hiv-disarm/scientists-find-way-to-disarm-aids-virus-idUSTRE78I5O820110919

93,MRK,Former Ark CEO's start-up launches with Merck deal," * Nigel Parker launches firm to develop gene therapies   * First project is bladder cancer treatment    By Paul Sandle	   LONDON, Sept 20 (Reuters) - A start-up led by Nigel Parker, the former chief executive of Ark Therapeutics , has secured a contract to develop Merck & Co’s gene therapy portfolio, including a candidate to treat bladder cancer.	   Parker said he was approached by the U.S. company due to his track record in developing, manufacturing and navigating the approvals process for gene therapies.	   “(Merck’s portfolio) is important clinically, and this allows it to be developed with people who have been absolutely in the thick of gene therapy,” Parker said in an interview.	   As part of the deal, Merck has taken an equity stake in Parker’s Finland-based start-up, FKD Therapies, which has reserves of $16 million, he said.	   FKD will start developing the portfolio with an adenovirus designed to carry an interferon gene into the bladder wall cells, where it can express a protein.	   Producing the protein within the bladder could increase its ability to penetrate tumour cells, Parker said, and a Phase I trial involving 14 patients had shown no tumour recurrence at three months for 43 percent of the patients.	   FKD also had options to develop Merck’s gene therapy programmes for glaucoma surgery failure and for the treatment of solid tumours, he said.	   Ark Therapeutics was a star of the gene therapy sector before Cerepro, its pioneering gene therapy medicine for brain cancer, was rejected by regulators in 2009.

94,MRK,"Bristol CEO says ""pure pharma"" strategy paying off","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Chief Executive of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said the company intends to remain “100 percent” in prescription medicines and is prepared to use its $10 billion cash hoard to gain new drugs through moderate size deals with other drugmakers.  Lamberto Andreotti also told scores of industry executives and analysts that the company’s recently approved Yervoy medicine for metastatic melanoma continues to generate good initial sales.  “We will continue to remain 100 percent pharma,” Andreotti said at the Pharmaceutical Strategic Alliances Conference in New York. He said it was beneficial to have “the entire management team strictly focused on one business.”  “We can continue to be successful as 100 percent pharma,” said Andreotti, whose company is deemed by many analysts to have the strongest lineup of recently approved drugs and medicines in the late stages of development in the industry.  The 153-year old company now focuses completely on prescription medicines after having divested its consumer product, medical devices and nutritional products divisions. Its former brands include Excedrin and Bufferin headache medicines and Convatec wound-healing products.  Two years ago the company spun off its majority stake in Mead Johnson, a leading nutritionals company that sells Enfamil baby formula, to focus on traditional prescription pills and sophisticated biotech drugs.  Meanwhile, big rivals such as Pfizer Inc, Merck & Co Inc, Novartis AG, Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi SA say they get more reliable profit growth from an array of product lines, including animal health, consumer healthcare products and low-cost generics.  And unlike larger drugmakers such as Pfizer and Merck that have grown by gobbling up rivals through huge deals, Andreotti says Bristol has avoided going down that path.  “We didn’t have to go through the disruption of mergers,” he said, noting that the 1989 Bristol-Myers tie up with Squibb was many years before his time at the helm.  Bristol-Myers has captured attention for Yervoy, a biotech drug that spurs the immune system to fight advanced melanoma — the deadliest form of skin cancer. It was approved in March and some analysts expect it to eventually generate annual sales of $6 billion as the first approved drug shown to extend survival of such patients.  Yervoy, which costs $120,000 for a full course of treatment, chalked up second quarter sales of $95 million — its first quarter on the market.  Andreotti declined to discuss Yervoy sales for the third quarter, but said the drug “continues to do well.”  Bristol-Myers acquired Yervoy through its $2.4 billion purchase of Medarex Inc in 2009. The company generates more than half of its revenue from deals it has made with other drugmakers, most far less costly than the Medarex transaction.  Andreotti noted that earlier on Thursday the company announced a collaboration with Ambrx Inc for an upfront payment of $24 million that gives Bristol-Myers access to drugs for type 2 diabetes and heart failure that he called “potential best-in-class” medicines.  Bristol-Myers has about $10 billion in cash with which to forge other deals.  “It feels very good to have $10 billion,” he said, flashing a big smile. “And it feels good to have it in the U.S.”  ",9222011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bristolmyers/bristol-ceo-says-pure-pharma-strategy-paying-off-idUSTRE78L73P20110922

CONTACT: Paul Tran, 301-796-9001   The committee will discuss an application from Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) for Vytorin (ezetimibe/simvastatin) and Zetia (ezetimibe) tablets. Simvastatin lowers lipids, or fats that circulate in the bloodstream, including cholesterol, by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase, which is an enzyme involved in producing lipids in the body, and ezetimibe lowers lipids by inhibiting the absorption of cholesterol from the intestine.   The proposed use for Zetia in combination with simvastatin or Vytorin is to reduce major cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease based on the results of the Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP). SHARP was a clinical trial that studied the effect of Vytorin compared with placebo on the occurrence of major cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease who did not have a history of myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization, or heart bypass surgery or opening heart vessels with a balloon or stents. The primary outcome of major cardiovascular events was defined as the first occurrence of either nonfatal myocardial infarction, cardiac death, stroke, or coronary or noncoronary revascularization (including nontraumatic amputation). The primary analysis demonstrated that assignment to Vytorin significantly reduced the relative risk of a major cardiovascular event by 16 percent compared to placebo.

98,MRK,Roche expects $10 billion sales for HDL drug,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The research chief of Roche Holding AG ROG.VX said the company’s experimental drug to raise “good” HDL cholesterol has the potential to generate annual sales of $10 billion and may have advantages over a rival medicine being developed by Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N).  “This is the order of magnitude we are looking at,” Jean-Jacques Garaud said in an interview on Friday, when asked if his dalcetrapib drug could produce annual sales in the $10 billion range.  That would make it a mega-blockbuster heart drug in the same league as today’s biggest cholesterol fighter, Pfizer Inc’s (PFE.N) Lipitor. Lipitor and other current top-selling cholesterol drugs work instead by lowering “bad” LDL cholesterol.  Garaud, head of Pharma Research and Early Development for the Swiss drugmaker, said Roche and partner Japan Tobacco Inc (2914.T) hope to seek regulatory approvals by 2013 for dalcetrapib.  He said dalcetrapib, if approved, would probably reach the market two years before Merck’s own HDL-boosting drug, called anacetrapib. They both belong to a new family of drugs called CETP inhibitors.  Researchers last month said dalcetrapib raised HDL levels by an average of 31 percent in a mid-stage study, without affecting levels of LDL choleterol. It is now being tested among tens of thousands of patients in large Phase III studies to see if it can prevent heart attacks and stroke.  Merck’s anacetrapib, by contrast, boosted HDL levels by a whopping 138 percent in a mid-stage trial described in November, while also cutting LDL levels by almost 40 percent.  Neither drug caused high blood pressure, a problem that helped doom Pfizer’s own CETP inhibitor, called torcetrapib. Pfizer scrapped its product in late 2006 after it was linked to deaths in a costly late-stage trial.  Torcetrapib, which Pfizer had expected to capture peak annual sales of $10 billion or more, boosted HDL levels by about 60 percent.  Although the HDL-raising ability of Merck’s drug appears far more impressive at first glance than Roche’s product, some researchers have speculated it might be preferable to avoid overly dramatic increases in HDL cholesterol. They say maybe less is more, given the failure of torcetrapib.  Garaud said the main consideration may be “cholesterol efflux,” meaning how well LDL is removed from the bloodstream as a result of boosting HDL.  “Even though their (anacetrapib’s) HDL elevation is higher, that might not be the best marker for potential activity,” he said. “What is important is how much cholesterol we pull from the blood. We think ours is better than any other drug.”  ",9232011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-roche-cholesterol/roche-expects-10-billion-sales-for-hdl-drug-idUSTRE78M56L20110923
99,MRK,Roche bone drug eases pain in prostate cancer trial,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Roche’s bone strengthening drug Boniva is as good for pain relief as single dose radiotherapy in patients whose prostate cancer has spread to their bones, according to data from a late-stage trial released on Sunday.  Trial investigators said the level side effects of Boniva — known generically as ibandronate (IB) — were also comparable with radiotherapy, suggesting it could offer an alternative option for advanced cancer patients suffering pain.  Bone metastases, or secondary tumors in the bone, are common in many advanced cancers and “are a serious problem for men with prostate cancer,” said Peter Hoskin a professor clinical oncology at University College, London, who presented the data at the European Multidisciplinary Cancer Congress (EMCC) in Stockholm on Sunday.  “We found that using IB was as good as single dose radiotherapy in controlling pain,” he said.  Boniva is one of a class of osteoporosis drugs known as bisphosphonates, which work by sticking to calcium and binding to it. Others in the same class include Novartis’s Zometa and Merck’s Fosamax.  They prevent bone loss by inhibiting the activity of cells that break down bone, called osteoclasts.  For the late stage, or Phase III, trial, researchers gave 470 patients with painful secondary tumors in the bone either a single dose of radiation or an intravenous infusion of Boniva.  Patients reported their main site of pain when they began the trial, and then again at four, eight, 12, 26 and 52 weeks after treatment.  Those who had not responded to the first treatment at four weeks crossed over to the alternative therapy and received their second treatment no later than week eight.  Pain levels were measured at four and 12 weeks by analysing how many painkillers patients were needing to take, and by scoring their reported pain levels using two standard methods called the WHO pain ladder and the Mercadante method.  “Although there were more patients in the IB group with worse Mercadante scores at four weeks who needed re-treatment, at six and 12 months, there was no long-term difference in pain relief between the two groups,” Hoskin said  The median survival of the four groups was 11.8 months for those on radiotherapy only, 11.4 months for those on the Roche drug only, 12.7 months for those on radiotherapy then Boniva, and 16.8 months for those on Boniva and then radiotherapy.  But Hoskin said it was too early to draw any conclusions from these data about the drug’s relative impact on survival in this group of patients.  “We hope to analyze these survival differences further in the hope that it can give us... pointers as to how and whether we should use a combination of treatments,” he said. “Currently we are unsure about the optimal timing and scheduling of treatment for these patients.”  For now Hoskin said Boniva, which is also sold under the brand name Bonviva, would be addition to the arsenal of other possible treatments for cancer pain and could potentially be useful in other types of the diseases such as breast cancer, where secondary bone tumors are also common.

102,MRK,Childhood vaccine funds agreed for more poor nations," LONDON, Sept 27 (Reuters) - The GAVI international immunisations group said on Tuesday it had agreed more than 50 new deals to fund potentially life-saving vaccines for children in 37 developing countries.	   The Geneva-based Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation said the agreements, which will help provide rotavirus, pneumococcal and other vaccines for children under five, were a big step in the fight against the two leading child killers — severe diarrhoea and pneumonia.	   Rotavirus shots made by various drug firms such as GlaxoSmithKline , Merck and Sanofi-Aventis  are part of routine childhood vaccinations in many wealthier nations and recent studies from the United States, Australia, El Salvador and Mexico showed swift falls in the number of children becoming ill with the virus. 	   In 2009, the World Health Organisation said all countries should include rotavirus shots in national vaccination programmes, but many poorer nations struggle to afford them. 	   GAVI said its rollout of rotavirus vaccines in Africa had started, in Sudan, and Tuesday’s agreements meant funding will now be available for these shots to go to children in 12 more African countries.	   GAVI said it had also agreed funding for 18 more countries to introduce pneumococcal vaccines — 12 of them in Africa — and for other types of vaccines, including measles, meningitis and pentavalent shots, in several other countries.	   Rotavirus is the leading cause of severe diarrhoea in children under five, killing more than 500,000 children each year worldwide and causing illness in several million more. Nearly 50 percent of all rotavirus deaths are in Africa.	   Pneumococcal disease causes pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis and also kills more than 500,000 children each year worldwide, the vast majority of them in Africa and Asia.	   “These new vaccines will prevent millions of children from dying of pneumonia and diarrhoea,” said Anthony Lake, executive director of the United Nations children’s fund UNICEF.	   “It is among the most vulnerable that these vaccines can make the biggest difference, especially if they are combined with better nutrition, sanitation and other critical interventions.”	   At it latest funding round in June, GAVI — a public-private partnership set up in 2000 to speed the introduction of vaccines into the world’s poorest countries —  won pledges of $4.3 billion from international donors. 	   Just ahead of that pledging meeting, several leading drugmakers said they were cutting prices on vaccines supplied through GAVI. 	   Vaccines for the GAVI-funded pneumococcal campaigns are being supplied by drugmakers Pfizer , GlaxoSmithKline as part of a so-called advance market commitment deal part-funded by Britain, Canada, Italy, Norway, Russia and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. 	   GAVI chief executive Seth Berkley said the alliance was delivering on its promise to protect more children against life-threatening but preventable diseases.	   Since it was launched at the World Economic Forum in 2000, GAVI says it has prevented more than five million future deaths and helped protect 288 million children with vaccines.

The transaction also gives J&J (JNJ.N) exclusive rights to other consumer brands sold by the two companies in the United States and Canada through their 22-year-old joint venture, while Merck retains rights to Pepcid outside North America, Merck said in a release.  The deal also gives J&J full ownership of the joint venture’s manufacturing plant in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where Mylanta and Pepcid — formerly a top-selling Merck prescription drug — are made.  U.S. regulators in July 2010 cited a dozen quality-control problems at the factory that paved the way for widely publicized recalls of Pepcid.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration highlighted problems with test procedures and record-keeping at the factory. The agency, for example, said consumers had complained that different products were packaged together, including berry-flavored Pepcid tablets mixed in with mint-flavored Pepcid.

The many recalls damaged J&J’s reputation and have hurt its earnings. The diversified healthcare company is making costly upgrades to McNeil plants under federal supervision to restock stores with its recalled brands, including Tylenol and Motrin painkillers, Rolaids antacids and its Benadryl and Zyrtec allergy drugs.

106,MRK,Twin rebukes jolt U.S. business tax holiday campaign,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A lobbying push in the Congress to give major corporations a tax break on their overseas profits suffered a setback on Tuesday when influential left- and right-wing think tanks both issued reports rejecting it.  The left-leaning Institute for Policy Studies said 10 big companies, including banking giants Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp, laid off workers after enjoying a similar foreign profits tax break in 2004-2005.  Despite promises that the tax break would boost the economy and stimulate hiring, the institute said that did not happen six years ago, and it likely would not happen this time either, if Congress were to approve another tax “holiday.”  The conservative Heritage Foundation, normally in conflict with the institute, agreed on this one.  The Bush administration’s 2004-2005 income tax repatriation holiday “did not produce the hoped-for subsequent surge in domestic investment,” the foundation said in a report.  “The current proposal would cut taxes, which is generally a good thing, but if another repatriation tax holiday were enacted, one should expect a similar result as last time: specifically, a surge in repatriations and little appreciable increase in domestic investment or job creation,” it said.  At issue is an estimated $1.5 trillion in foreign profits that U.S. multinationals have parked abroad, avoiding the 35-percent U.S. corporate income tax. The companies want to bring these earnings home to the United States, but they do not want to pay the full tax. So they are pressing for a replay of the Bush-era tax break, except on a larger scale.  In 2004-2005, 843 corporations brought home $362 billion in overseas income at a 5.25-percent tax rate.  Legislation under study in Congress would let corporations repatriate their foreign profits again at the same rate. And just as they did before, companies are today portraying this proposal as a boost to jobs and the economy.  EXECS, SHAREHOLDERS GOT GAINS-REPORT  Chuck Collins, co-author of the institute’s report, was skeptical. “History shows that many ‘tax holiday’ companies use repatriated profits to reward executives and other shareholders, then lay off workers. Corporate tax holidays have resulted in precious few U.S. jobs,” Collins said.  The institute’s report concluded that 58 corporations which accounted for 70 percent of overseas profits repatriated under the Bush tax break collectively saved $64 billion in taxes, then cut 600,000 jobs through layoffs in subsequent years.  “A study blaming seven years of job losses on repatriation is truly bizarre and isn’t worth the paper it’s printed on,” said Doug Thornell, spokesman for WIN America, a coalition of multinationals lobbying in Congress for the tax break.  “The fact is, the year after repatriation was passed, unemployment dropped by half a point and (gross domestic product) grew by 1.3 percent,” Thornell said.  The New Democrat Network, a centrist group, issued a report in August saying an overseas tax repatriation holiday would bring new net revenue into the U.S. Treasury.  At a time of soaring government deficits, the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan congressional research arm, has estimated that another tax holiday, like the one favored by WIN America, would eventually cost taxpayers about $78.7 billion over the next decade.

Telecom giant Verizon Communications Inc and chemical makers Dow Chemical Co, and DuPont are also singled out as corporations that “benefited the most financially from the tax holiday and slashed the most jobs.”  The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is looking into the results of the 2004-2005 tax holiday as well.

109,MRK,"Citi, BofA cut workers after US tax holiday-report"," * Left-leaning group hits push for another tax holiday   * Report singles out 10 companies for cutting jobs   WASHINGTON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Ten major U.S. corporations, including big banks Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), laid off workers after enjoying a tax holiday in 2004-2005 that had been billed as a form of economic stimulus, said a report released on Tuesday.   With large multinational companies today pressing Congress for another tax holiday, the Institute for Policy Studies reported that the last one did not fulfill its rosy promises for hundreds of thousands of U.S. workers.   Fifty-eight corporations that accounted for 70 percent of overseas profits repatriated under the 2004-2005 tax break collectively saved $64 billion in taxes, then cut 600,000 jobs through layoffs, the report said.   It is the latest in a series of warring studies on whether U.S. multinationals should be allowed, for the second time, to bring home hundreds of billions of dollars in overseas profits at a bargain-basement tax rate.   Large companies are lobbying again for such a tax break, which would let them repatriate much if not all of an estimated $1.5 trillion in overseas profits for well below the full 35-percent corporate income tax rate.   Legislation in the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives would let them repatriate those profits at 5.25 percent, the same tax rate given to them under a similar tax holiday during the Bush administration.   Just as they are doing now, companies six years ago said that the repatriation tax break would boost jobs and the economy. But the institute said this did not happen, as earlier academic studies have also found.   “History shows that many ‘tax holiday’ companies use repatriated profits to reward executives and other shareholders, then lay off workers. Corporate tax holidays have resulted in precious few U.S. jobs,” said Chuck Collins, co-author of the report from the left-leaning institute.   Besides Citi and Bank of America, the report focuses on technology group Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N), drugmakers Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N), and manufacturers Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N).   Telecom giant Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and chemical makers Dow Chemical Co DOW.N, and DuPont DD.N are also singled out as corporations that “benefited the most financially from the tax holiday and slashed the most jobs.”   The U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is looking into the results of the 2004-2005 tax holiday as well. A report from the panel is expected within a few weeks, its chairman, Democrat Carl Levin, told Reuters last month.   In 2004-2005, 843 corporations brought home $362 billion in overseas income at a 5.25-percent tax rate. Analysts said that experience encouraged companies to park more income overseas, allowing them to postpone indefinitely paying any U.S. income tax on it, as long as the money stays abroad.   With the economy struggling and new government stimulus hard to come by, a well-financed corporate lobbying campaign — organized under the WIN America coalition — is arguing that another tax holiday would boost the economy.   As reported by Reuters in August, the coalition has hired dozens of former congressional tax-writing committee staffers.   The New Democrat Network, a centrist group, issued a report in August saying an overseas tax repatriation holiday would bring new net revenue into the U.S. Treasury.   At a time of soaring government deficits, the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan congressional research arm, has estimated that a tax holiday, like the one proposed in the House and favored by WIN America, would eventually cost taxpayers about $78.7 billion over the next decade.

111,MRK,UPDATE 1-US FDA OKs Eli Lilly's Cialis for enlarged prostate," * Cialis can work for both impotence and enlarged prostate   * Cialis posted sales of $1.7 billion in 2010   Oct 6 (Reuters) - U.S. drug regulators approved Eli Lilly’s (LLY.N) Cialis drug to treat enlargement of the prostate on Thursday, expanding use of the blockbuster impotence medicine.   The Food and Drug Administration said Cialis could be labeled for treatment of the signs and symptoms of a non-cancerous enlarged prostate, called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and also be used for people who have both BPH and erectile dysfunction.   About half of men over 50 suffer from prostate problems, which can cause difficulty urinating.   “BPH can have a big impact on a patient’s quality of life,” said Scott Monroe, director of the FDA’s division of reproductive and urologic products. “Cialis offers these men another treatment option, particularly those who also have ED (erectile dysfunction), which is also common in older men.”   U.S. researchers reported in the journal Urology in 2008 that impotence drugs could help reduce the symptoms caused by an enlarged prostate.   The FDA said it has approved eight other drugs to treat BPH, including Merck & Co’s (MRK.N) Proscar, GlaxoSmithKline’s (GSK.L) Avodart and Pfizer’s (PFE.N) Cardura.   In an interview in July, Eli Lilly CEO John Lechleiter said he expects the longer-lasting Cialis to overtake Pfizer’s Viagra to become the market leader for impotence drugs.   Cialis, which the FDA approved for impotence in 2003, posted sales of $1.7 billion in 2010, up nine percent from the previous year, while global Viagra sales climbed 2 percent last year to $1.9 billion.

112,MRK,FACTBOX-Impact of a Supreme Court ruling on the health law," Oct 6 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama’s sweeping overhaul of the nation’s healthcare system will top the agenda in the new U.S. Supreme Court term that opened on Monday. [ID:nS1E78S1LY]   Legal challenges to the healthcare reform law have focused on whether Congress exceeded its powers by requiring Americans to buy insurance or face a penalty.   Here is what the law means for various players in the health world:   The court is likely to issue a ruling on the law by the end of June, in the midst of the presidential campaign in which Obama seeks another four-year term. A ruling striking down the law would be a huge blow for Obama months before the election, giving a boost to his Republican opponent.   A ruling upholding the law would represent a vindication for Obama, but might make healthcare an even bigger rallying cry for the Republican presidential candidates, all of whom oppose it as a costly and unnecessary government expansion.   If the court declines to rule on the law’s constitutionality, Republicans may still continue their strategy of chipping away at individual provisions in the law piece-by-piece.   The requirement that all Americans buy insurance, called the individual mandate, provides the industry with a large and steady pool of customers. If the mandate is repealed, but companies such as Cigna (CI.N) or Wellpoint WLP.N are still forced to cover all Americans, including those with pre-existing health conditions, insurance premiums would likely rise.   White House officials argue it is only by requiring healthy people to purchase insurance that they can help pay for reforms, including a provision that individuals with pre-existing medical conditions cannot be refused coverage.   Some consumer groups argue a repeal of the individual mandate would lead to higher insurance premiums for Americans as a whole, as those without coverage would continue to use the emergency room as their only healthcare, shifting costs onto the insured.   Higher premiums could also reduce the number of those choosing to purchase insurance, undoing the law’s promise to extend health insurance to the more than 30 million Americans currently without it.   Small businesses are eligible for tax credits to help provide insurance benefits to their workers. They can also have more choice in insurance coverage, since state exchanges must have at least two multi-state health plans.   However, businesses with more than 50 employees that do not offer health insurance by 2014, when universal coverage is set to kick in, will have to pay a fee per employee.   Small firms argue the law does not address underlying high insurance costs and instead forces new requirements and taxes on companies, raising the cost of doing business.   The healthcare law includes fines for larger businesses where some employees seek subsidized coverage on state insurance exchanges that are to be up and running by 2014. It also penalizes companies that fail to provide minimum health coverage levels that will be determined by the law’s essential benefits rule.   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, corporate America’s biggest lobbying group, supports the repeal of the healthcare law, which it blames for burdensome regulation and additional penalties and taxes.   States are charged with carrying out the bulk of the reforms in the healthcare law and many of those suing are still setting up state-run exchanges for health insurance and other elements. They hope to exert enough control to limit the reach of the law and also have access to federal funding if the Supreme Court rules the law is valid.   Along with worrying whether the law usurps their rights, states are concerned they cannot afford to carry out all of the changes it requires as they are tightening their fiscal belts.   Those in the industry have generally been on board with the new legislation, which will give them millions more patients who need drugs, hospitals and doctors. Most industry representatives are also wary of further legal uncertainty over the law that complicates planning.   The pharmaceutical industry — including Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) and other drugmakers — have to pay more than $2 billion a year in taxes starting from next year to help pay for the healthcare overhaul. They have also committed to offering certain drug rebates and discounts, expecting to balance those out with a boost from newly insured people. The repeal of the individual mandate would skew that math.   Rather than working to repeal the whole thing, drugmakers and others in the health industry are contesting specific provisions in the law, including a Medicare advisory board aimed at cost-cutting and another body that will closely compare the effectiveness of medications as well as other treatments.   Similar to the drugmakers, medical device companies also face higher taxes starting in 2013 to help pay for the law. Companies such as Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N) and Medtronic Inc (MDT.N) are vigorously working to repeal the 2.3 percent sales tax.   The healthcare law is expected to give hospitals a flood of revenue from newly insured patients. It also cuts the cost of emergency care for uninsured patients, which hospitals are legally bound to provide.

114,MRK,FDA approves Merck's new diabetes therapy combo,"(Reuters) - U.S. health regulators approved a new combination therapy for type 2 diabetes from Merck & Co, the first to combine a diabetes drug with cholesterol-lowering medicine in one tablet. Merck’s new drug Juvisync combines the drugmaker’s diabetes medicine Januvia, which helps lower high blood sugar levels, with simvastatin, a commonly prescribed statin that helps lower cholesterol alongside diet and exercise. About 20 million Americans have type 2 diabetes, and many of them also have high cholesterol levels. The conditions can lead to increased risk of heart disease, stroke, kidney disease and blindness, especially if left untreated or poorly treated, the Food and Drug Association said. For Merck, this is a chance to boost sales of Januvia, generically known as sitagliptin, whose sales rose 30 percent to $779 million in the second quarter. The American Diabetes Association guidelines recommend statin therapy for anyone who has both diabetes and cardiovascular disease, regardless of cholesterol levels. They also recommend statins for anyone older than 40 with diabetes and with cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as high blood pressure. Merck’s experts have estimated that 6 million to 8 million of the type 2 diabetics who should be on a statin have not been receiving that therapy — a gap that the company hopes to fill with the single-tablet Juvisync. “Although clinical guidelines put people with diabetes at the same risk level as those with coronary heart disease, nearly 40 percent of eligible patients do not receive statin treatment,” Dr. Barry Goldstein, Merck’s vice president for diabetes and endocrinology, said in a statement. “We are proud to bring forward a treatment option that can help address this important health issue.” The FDA on Friday approved the combination in several dosage strengths. The most common side effects of Juvisync include upper respiratory infection, stuffy or runny nose and sore throat, headache, muscle and stomach pain, constipation and nausea, regulators said. Merck will now have to conduct a post-marketing clinical trial to compare how Januvia lowers glucose alone compared to its combination with simvastatin, the FDA said. Merck’s shares were up 1.5 percent at $31.88 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Approved in 2006, Januvia was the first FDA-backed member of a new class of drugs called DPP-4 inhibitors that enhance the body’s ability to lower elevated blood sugar. It has previously been coupled with another diabetes drug, metformin, and sold under the brand name Janumet. Merck’s second-quarter sales of Janumet reached $321 million.

119,MRK,UPDATE 3-US advisers recommend Gardasil HPV shots for boys,"* Panel says shots would protect males and females * Cost of vaccine still a concern By Julie Steenhuysen CHICAGO, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Boys should be routinely vaccinated against the human papillomavirus or HPV in an effort to protect them from oral, anal and penile cancers, and to extend protection of girls from cervical cancer, U.S. vaccine advisers said on Tuesday. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which advises the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, voted unanimously to recommend routine use of Merck & Co’s Gardasil in 11- and 12-year-old boys to fight the sexually transmitted virus, with 13 yes votes and one abstention. Previously, the CDC had said doctors are free to use the vaccine in boys but had stopped short of recommending routine vaccination. Boys aged 13-21 who have not been vaccinated should be given a catch-up dose of the vaccine, which is given in a three-dose series. Men aged 22 through 26 may be vaccinated but the vaccine is not recommended for routine use, the panel said. Currently, the CDC recommends HPV vaccinations made by Merck and GlaxoSmithKline  for girls and women between the ages of 11 and 26. The prior recommendations were based largely on evidence that the vaccine protects boys from genital warts, but the new recommendations reflect several studies showing the vaccine helps prevent cancers in boys as well, Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a conference call with reporters. The HPV vaccine offers an opportunity to decrease the burden of HPV in both males and females, Schuchat said. “In addition to providing a direct benefit to boys, there is also the potential that the vaccine will reduce the spread of HPV from males to females,” she said. Schuchat noted that the HPV vaccine currently is not being as widely used among girls as hoped, and vaccinating boys could help reduce transmission of HPV to girls. Besides the HPV shot recommendation, the panel on Tuesday also recommended Hepatitis B vaccinations for unvaccinated adults with diabetes who are under the age of 60 and said those older than 60 “may” get the Hepatitis B vaccine. During the meeting, CDC experts advised the panel there is no evidence the vaccine can cause “mental retardation,” a concern raised by Republican congresswoman Michele Bachmann in a Republican presidential candidate debate. The U.S. medical community repudiated Bachmann’s claim, which she made as a swipe at a rival, Texas Governor Rick Perry, who issued an executive order in 2007 mandating girls get the HPV vaccine as part of a school immunization program. Perry’s order was later overturned. The committee’s strong recommendations, which are subject to CDC approval, likely will mean insurance companies will begin paying for the vaccine when used in boys. “Today’s ACIP recommendations will help to provide greater access to Gardasil for males,” said Dr. Mark Feinberg, chief public health and science officer, Merck Vaccines. Insurance companies have largely considered the CDC’s prior policy recommendation for boys as optional and some have refused to cover the shots for boys. “I think it’s a worthwhile vaccine,” said Dr. Jay Siwek, a professor of family medicine at Georgetown University Medical Center, who was not part of the panel. Siwek said the only downside of the vaccine is cost, which is $360 for a course of three shots. In his own practice, Siwek tells parents the vaccine protects against cancers that occur in boys — mostly mouth and throat — and it helps protect girls from cancer as well. Dr. Robert Haddad of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, said there has been a epidemic of HPV-related head and neck cancers. “HPV is a cause of many cancers so it is really important to support endeavors to vaccinate,” he said. The approval, which only applies to Merck’s vaccine, may bolster sales of Gardasil, which have stalled amid competition from a rival GlaxoSmithKline product and because many younger women already have been immunized with Gardasil, limiting the market size. Gardasil’s sales hit $1.1 billion worldwide in 2009 and have been hovering in that range.

121,MRK,UPDATE 2-US advisers recommend diabetics get Hep B vaccine,"* Diabetics under 60 “should” get vaccine * People with diabetes likelier to get infected with Hep B By Alina Selyukh Oct 25 (Reuters) - U.S. vaccine advisers on Tuesday voted to recommend vaccination against Hepatitis B for adults with diabetes under the age of 60, and said people older than 60 may get the vaccine. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which advises the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, voted 12-2 to include diabetics in the high-risk group of unvaccinated adults that should get vaccinated. It is the first time the panel made a Hepatitis B vaccine recommendation for people with diabetes, after studies showed those under the age of 60 were more than twice as likely to get infected than people without diabetes. Studies found no observed significant increase of Hepatitis B in diabetics over the age of 60, researchers said in a presentation on Tuesday. Hepatitis B is a serious disease that can turn chronic and lead to liver damage or cancer. People infected with the virus can spread it to others through contact with blood or other body fluids even if they show no symptoms. Although there is no cure, the disease can be prevented with a vaccine. The CDC has recommended routine Hepatitis B vaccination for children and adolescents since 1991. The recommendation also applies to unvaccinated adults at risk of getting infected, such as people with chronic liver or kidney disease, men who have sex with men, people with more than one sex partner or those whose jobs expose them to human blood. If the CDC follows its advisers’ recommendation, that list will be expanded to include people with diabetes under the age of 60. For older diabetics, the panel allowed flexibility for consultation with doctors on the need for the vaccine. The vote on Hep B followed the panel’s recommendation on Tuesday that boys should be vaccinated with Merck & Co’s Gardasil against human papillomavirus. Merck also makes one of the two Hepatitis B vaccines available in the United States, Recombivax. GlaxoSmithKline makes the other, Engerix-B. Dynavax Technologies Corp’s has another Hepatitis B vaccine targeted at adults, Heplisav, in clinical trial. People with diabetes have been the focus of Hepatitis B vaccination discussions for several years, as studies started pointing to their increased likelihood of having the virus, generally acquired through blood glucose monitoring. The test involves puncturing skin to get a drop of blood to put on a strip of a device that gives a reading. Any lapse in sterility, such as several people being tested using the same device or supplies, can increase risk of exposure to infected blood. Younger people are more responsive to the vaccination, the effectiveness of which could wane over time, researchers said. Earlier vaccinations may also start protecting newly-diagnosed patients sooner, as studies find two-thirds of diabetes diagnoses have been made by age 60. The cost of immunization versus gained benefits also quadruples from people in their forties to people in their fifties, but then it leaps almost six-fold for people over 60. Bearing in mind that healthcare law makes the panel’s recommendations binding for insurance coverage, members voted for age-specific Hepatitis B recommendations with the caveat that they could further detail them later to ensure vaccinations were covered for those who needed them regardless of age.

122,MRK,Advisers back Merck drug for some kidney patients,"SILVER SPRING, Maryland (Reuters) - Health advisers on Wednesday unanimously recommended use of Merck & Co’s cholesterol-lowering drug Vytorin for preventing stroke and other heart problems in patients with chronic kidney disease, but only in those patients not yet on dialysis. The panel of outside experts convened by the Food and Drug Administration were less convinced about the drug’s effectiveness in patients with end-stage renal disease who are already receiving dialysis, voting 6-10 that trial data supported Vytorin use by those patients. “I’ve not said that this is a no, I just feel the data are equivocal and do not support approval for that specific use,” said Dr. Robert Smith, a professor at Brown University. The FDA will make the final decision but usually follows the advice of its advisory panels. Vytorin pairs a new type of cholesterol fighter Zetia, or ezetimibe, with Merck’s older statin drug Zocor, or simvastatin. Vytorin is already approved for lowering cholesterol, but Merck is now hoping to expand its use to prevent heart problems in patients with chronic kidney disease. If approved, this would be the first such treatment. Chronic kidney disease affects about 14 percent of the U.S. population and puts people at a high risk of developing heart disease and having a stroke or heart attack. Previous trials of statins have shown little impact on reducing heart risk in patients with kidney disease and many experts have been skeptical about the effectiveness of such therapy. Early trials of Vytorin raised further skepticism about the medicine as they showed substantially more cancer cases among patients taking the drug than a placebo. However, later research allayed these fears. The latest Vytorin trial, which followed nearly 9,500 patients for about five years, showed the drug reduced the risk of major vascular problems in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease by 16 percent. But the trial’s results were less pronounced in patients whose kidney problems progressed so much as to require dialysis. Those patients made up about one-third of all trial participants and a portion of the pre-dialysis patients also began receiving dialysis over the course of the trial. “I feel that there’s really insufficient evidence to discriminate between dialysis patients and non-dialysis patients but there’s also insufficient evidence to say this drug is beneficial in dialysis patients,” said Dr. David Gordon, a panel member from the Division of Cardiovascular Sciences at the National Institutes of Health. The trial showed that 6.2 percent of patients taking Vytorin went on to require operations to open blocked arteries, compared with 7.8 percent of those taking a dummy pill. The percentage of people having stroke was 3.5 percent compared with 4.6 percent on placebo. A slight decline in risk was also observed with non-fatal heart attacks and cardiac death. When separated into subgroups, pre-dialysis patients showed a 23 percent risk reduction in major vascular events, while patients on dialysis saw a 6 percent risk reduction. But because the trial did not specifically study the two subgroups separately, several panel members expressed reluctance at splitting their vote on the drug into two questions and some said they voted “no” to indicate they did not support separating out dialysis patients. Merck Research Laboratories President Peter Kim welcomed the panel’s recommendation and said the company would continue working with the FDA on its review. Merck’s patents on both Vytorin and Zetia expire in 2017. In 2010, Vytorin posted sales of $2 billion and Zetia reaped $2.3 billion.

125,MRK,UPDATE 3-Coach who saw Penn State sex assault put on leave,"* Students to hold vigil for sex abuse victims * Abuse victim’s mother says young son feared Sandusky * University appoints Merck CEO to head investigation  (Adds McQueary on administrative leave, other details) By Ernest Scheyder and Ian Simpson STATE COLLEGE, Pa., Nov 11 (Reuters) - A key figure in the Penn State University sex abuse scandal was placed on administrative leave on Friday as university officials scrambled to contain the damage after shocking allegations of child rape rocked the campus in the last week. The university may even see its borrowing costs rise in the coming months after a credit agency said it may consider downgrading Penn’s debt rating. The scandal has already led to the firing of Joe Paterno, the revered coach who led the university’s football team, the Nittany Lions, for 46 years, and the university’s president. On Friday, the university put linebacker coach Mike McQueary on administrative leave. McQueary had testified to a grand jury that he saw former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky rape a child in the showers at a campus locker room in 2002 and said he reported what he saw to Paterno. Sandusky was charged last Saturday. The university had said “multiple threats” had been made against McQueary. As the scandal has exploded over the normally peaceful university town in central Pennsylvania, the horror at horror at Sandusky’s alleged crimes has been compounded by concern of about a possible high-level cover-up. Many Penn State fans have said it is unfair that Paterno was dismissed and that McQueary was not. Paterno said he was told in 2002 that Sandusky engaged in sexually inappropriate behavior with a young boy. He told his boss, but did not call the police. The mother of one boy involved said on Friday she feared Sandusky could have had many more victims than the eight included in the charges against him so far. “The people that hid this need to pay for their actions. They allowed this to happen to a lot of kids,” the woman told ABC’s “Good Morning America”. The mother, whose son is identified as Victim 1 in court papers, said there had been “so many years that he had access to these children, and I don’t believe that it stops at eight.” She said her son described Sandusky as a “weirdo.” The scandal reverberated as far as Wall Street when ratings agency Moody’s warned of a possible credit downgrade. “Over the next several months, Moody’s will evaluate the potential scope of reputation and financial risk arising from these events,” Dennis Gephart, a senior analyst at Moody’s said in a release. The agency said the scandal could lead to lawsuits and settlements, weaker student demand, declines in philanthropic giving, and significant management or governance changes. Penn State students pledged to show support for the child victims of the alleged abuse at the last home football game of the season on Saturday. The mood on the campus was calm, but authorities planned to boost security after what police described as a “riotous mob” of students two days ago protested Paterno’s firing. University board of trustees member Linda Strumpf told Reuters the board had considered canceling the game. “We felt very strongly that to penalize the players and the fans and the band ... was just the wrong thing to do,” she said. Sandusky was charged on Saturday with sexually abusing eight young boys over more than a decade. Former Penn State athletic director Tim Curley and former finance official Gary Schultz, were charged with failing to report an incident. Sandusky, Curley and Schultz denied the charges. Paterno met his legal obligation by reporting the abuse allegation to Curley, legal experts said. Penn State’s board of trustees on Friday appointed Kenneth Frazier, the chief executive of drugmaker Merck & Co. and a Penn State alum, to head a special committee to investigate the events that lead up to the charges against Sandusky. “We are going to do everything we can to restore the public’s faith,” Frazier told reporters. The scandal has rocked the campus of about 45,000 students in the town of State College, the flagship of about two dozen Penn State campuses across the state. Instead of the usual pre-game rally on Friday night, students planned a candle-light vigil for the alleged sex abuse victims and fans going to the final home game were urged to wear blue — the color associated with a “stop child abuse” campaign — rather than traditional white. “We have to raise child abuse awareness. No one wanted to see Joe Paterno fired. We want to see some good come out of this,” said Jeff Lowe, 20, from Austin, Texas, who had a blue ribbon pinned to his shirt. Lowe was among hundreds of Penn State fans camped out in advance of Saturday’s game against Nebraska to get good seats. The traditional sea of tents that springs up before each home game has long been dubbed “Paternoville.” Penn State undergraduate student body president TJ Hurd said he did not expect violence at the game. Interim Penn State head coach Tom Bradley said he was not concerned about the safety of players. The mother of Victim 1 said her son was 11 years old when he met Sandusky in 2005 through the former assistant coach’s Second Mile charity program for at-risk children. She said her son had feared speaking out against Sandusky, telling her: “I didn’t know what to do ... you just can’t tell Jerry no.” But she said he is “doing OK” and felt a sense of relief when Sandusky was charged. Prosecutors said Sandusky met all his alleged victims through the nonprofit group, which has said it cut ties with him in 2008. Sandusky coached for more than two decades at Penn State before retiring in 1999 and was once considered a likely successor to Paterno. After his retirement he retained access to Penn State facilities. A ninth possible victim, now in his 20s, has since come forward, according to the Patriot-News in Harrisburg, and Pennsylvania police have set up a telephone hotline to receive information about the sexual abuse allegations. Prosecutors in Texas also opened an investigation on Thursday into Sandusky after grand jury testimony in Pennsylvania indicated that he may have abused a young boy when Penn State was in San Antonio for the 1999 Alamo Bowl. College football is hugely popular in the United States, drawing massive television audiences every Saturday in the late summer and autumn and filling huge stadiums. Penn State’s Beaver Stadium, which seats about 106,000, is one of the largest. Teams generate millions of dollars in revenue and successful ones raise the profile of their universities. That, in turn, helps fundraising — such as the $2 billion capital campaign now under way at Penn State.

One of Paterno’s sons confirmed that his father, who has not been charged in the case, had hired J. Sedgwick “Wick” Sollers, a prominent Washington criminal defense lawyer. Sollers, of King & Spalding, has in the past represented former president George H.W. Bush. Paterno “wants very much to speak publicly and answer questions. At this stage, however, he has no choice but to be patient and defer to the legal process,” Scott Paterno said in an emailed statement. Also on Friday, the university put linebacker coach Mike McQueary on paid administrative leave. McQueary had testified to a grand jury that he saw former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky rape a boy in the showers at a campus locker room in 2002 and said he reported what he saw to Paterno.

Sandusky coached for more than two decades at Penn State before retiring in 1999 and was once considered a likely successor to Paterno. After his retirement he retained access to Penn State facilities. A ninth possible victim, now in his 20s, has since come forward, according to the Patriot-News in Harrisburg, and Pennsylvania police have set up a telephone hotline to receive information about the sexual abuse allegations. Prosecutors in Texas have also opened an investigation into Sandusky after grand jury testimony in Pennsylvania indicated that he may have abused a young boy when Penn State was in San Antonio for the 1999 Alamo Bowl.

127,MRK,Life-saving study results lift Bayer/J&J; clot drug,"ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) - Data showing the life- saving benefits of a very low dose of a new blood clot preventer could alter future treatment of patients who suffer from acute coronary syndrome and provide a boost for the drug’s makers Bayer AG and Johnson & Johnson. Results of a large, late-stage clinical trial presented on Sunday showed the new pill, Xarelto, reduced the risk of death by more than 30 percent in patients who have had an ACS episode, typically a heart attack caused by a blocked coronary artery. Xarelto was added on top of blood thinners that are now the standard of care. The Atlas study signals a new option for the estimated 1.2 million Americans treated for ACS each year and could open up a market worth up to $3 billion for the drug’s manufacturers. The companies plan to seek approval for the use by year’s end. “We have seen with this trial a new standard of anti-thrombotic therapy emerge,” said Dr. Paul Armstrong, professor of medicine at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, who provided commentary on the Xarelto trial at the American Heart Association scientific meeting in Orlando, where the study’s details were unveiled. Xarelto won the battle of new blood thinners at least on Sunday, as apixaban from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer, and Merck’s vorapaxar each failed to meet the main goal of separate, unrelated studies presented at the meeting attended by thousands of doctors and researchers. In the Atlas study of 15,526 patients, those who received 2.5 milligrams of Xarelto twice a day on top of current standard therapy had the risk of cardiovascular death cut by 34 percent and all causes of death by 32 percent compared to patients on Plavix and aspirin, or just aspirin. “Until now we have only used anti-platelet therapy and now we have another class of drug that appears to provide additive benefit, so I think that is a landmark event,” Dr. Raymond Gibbons of the Mayo Clinic said in an interview at the meeting. Xarelto patients did have a significantly higher incidence of major bleeding, including intracranial bleeding, but no increase in fatal bleeds. Researchers said the lower death rate trumped the bleeding risk. “You only have to treat 56 patients to save a life. It’s hard not to be excited by the mortality benefit,” said Dr. Michael Gibson, the study’s lead investigator, who presented the results at the meeting. “If it is approved (for this use) I think it will be widely adopted,” Gibson said. Xarelto, which inhibits a protein called Factor Xa involved in the blood clotting process, is vying for position with other new medicines in the multibillion-dollar anti-clot market, including apixaban and Pradaxa, which is sold by privately held German drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim. Earlier this month, Xarelto won U.S. approval for preventing strokes in patients with a dangerously irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation, considered to be by far the largest and most lucrative use for the new generation of blood thinners at an estimated $10 billion. Pradaxa is also approved in those patients. Based on data from earlier studies in atrial fibrillation patients, apixaban has been widely viewed as the best of the new clot preventers. The Xarelto results in ACS patients could help to level the playing field somewhat as apixaban failed to help those patients in a prior study. In data presented in Orlando, apixaban tackled seriously ill hospitalized patients at high risk of developing dangerous blood clots in the limbs and lungs. Xarelto suffered a setback in April when surprisingly high bleeding rates deemed the drug unacceptable for such patients. Apixaban, which was compared to an older injected drug, enoxaparin, showed a trend toward improvement but came up short of achieving a statistically significant result. Merck’s vorapaxar was also tested in ACS patients, but proved to be no better in reducing a host of cardiovascular problems when added on top of aspirin and Plavix. It also increased the risk of bleeding, including tripling the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Researchers did find vorapaxar cut heart attacks, which they said warranted further study. The drug’s prospects already were dimmed after being deemed inappropriate for stroke patients in January, but Merck said it would wait until it has results from another large study early next year before deciding the medicine’s fate. Vorapaxar had been touted as the most important drug in Schering-Plough’s experimental drug pipeline when Merck acquired its rival for $41 billion in late 2009.

129,MRK,Merck clot drug fails main goal,"ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) - An experimental anti-clotting drug from Merck & Co failed to meet the main goal of  improving a host of cardiovascular problems in a large study and tripled the risk of bleeding in the brain, researchers said on Sunday. The prospects for vorapaxar had already been severely dented after a safety committee overseeing this and another large study of the drug in January said it was not appropriate in patients who had suffered a stroke, due to excess bleeding. While Wall Street analysts had largely written off vorapaxar, once seen as possibly generating $3 billion in annual sales, there were hopes the Tracer study results presented on Sunday could somewhat revive the product. Patients on vorapaxar did see a lower incidence of heart attacks, according to the results presented at the American Heart Association scientific sessions in Orlando, and Merck said it was still awaiting results from the second study, due early next year, before making any decisions on the medicine’s future. “There is a signal of efficacy with vorapaxar driven primarily by” a reduction in heart attacks, said Dr. Kenneth Mahaffey, one of the study’s lead investigators. He called the reduction intriguing, “but when you balance it with the bleeding then it becomes a little less impressive.” Vorapaxar was considered the most important drug in Schering-Plough’s experimental drug pipeline when Merck acquired its rival for $41 billion in late 2009. The primary goal of the Tracer study was a reduction in a combination of cardiovascular death, heart attack, stroke, hospitalization for chest pain and need for artery clearing procedures. After two years, 18.5 percent of patients on vorapaxar and 19.9 percent of patients who received a placebo had suffered one of those adverse events. The 8 percent relative difference was not considered to be statistically significant. All patients in the study were already on standard blood thinners, primarily aspirin and Plavix or just aspirin. A secondary goal of the study looked at just cardiac death, heart attack and stroke, and by that measure vorapaxar came out looking better. In vorapaxar patients, 14.7 percent had such an event compared with 16.4 percent for placebo, primarily due to a difference in heart attacks. There was no difference in death and only a modest difference in stroke, researchers said. Bleeding rates were nearly 40 percent higher in vorapaxar patients, and there was a three-fold increase in intracranial hemorrhage. “The magnitude of the excess of bleeding was quite unexpected” based on previous studies, Mahaffey said. The bleeding risk also increased over time for vorapaxar, researchers said. Mahaffey did not believe the trial’s failure meant the end for vorapaxar or the class of anti-platelet drugs known as PAR 1 inhibitors. “Clearly the bleeding needs to be understood more,” he said.

136,MRK,Fund backs cervical cancer vaccine in poor nations,"LONDON (Reuters) - The GAVI international immunisations group has agreed to fund the roll-out of vaccines against cervical cancer in developing countries, offering protection against a disease that kills one woman every two minutes. Nearly 90 percent of the 275,000 deaths every year occur in poor nations, where cervical screening programs that are routine in rich nations are virtually non-existent. The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation said up to two million girls in nine developing countries could be protected from cervical cancer by 2015 under the programme, which still depends on negotiating a final price deal with manufacturers. Nina Schwalbe, its managing director for policy and performance, said discussions were ongoing with the makers of the world’s two approved HPV vaccines, Merck & Co Inc and GlaxoSmithKline Plc. Human papillomavirus, or HPV, is a sexually transmitted virus that causes most cases of cervical cancer. Adolescent girls are commonly vaccinated against HPV in Europe and the United States but the greatest need for the vaccine is actually in the developing world, where the burden of disease is far higher. “For women in developing countries this is the only option,” Schwalbe said in a telephone interview from Dhaka, where a GAVI board meeting gave the green light to the initiative. “The introduction of an HPV vaccine is a major public health breakthrough — but to date this vaccine has only been available for women who live in developed countries.” For GAVI, which was set up a decade ago with backing from governments and Microsoft Corp co-founder Bill Gates, the decision to endorse HPV vaccination marks a step change, since until now it has been focused on vaccinating infants. Merck’s Gardasil and GSK’s Cervarix are designed for use in girls aged between 10 and 13 years. The first developing countries could be up and running with vaccination programmes from 2013, with Rwanda and Vietnam — both of which have conducted pilot vaccination programmes — likely to be among the first. U.S. drugmaker Merck said earlier this year it would offer GAVI its Gardasil shot at a deeply discounted price of $5 per dose, implying a cost of $15 for a three-dose course. Schwalbe described this as “a good starting offer.” Britain’s GSK has not made a public price offer but Jean Stephenne, head of the group’s vaccines business, said he looked forward to discussing how to provide Cervarix in a sustainable way to GAVI. GAVI’s move to close inequalities in access to HPV vaccination was welcomed by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who also praised a separate plan by the Geneva-based group to open a funding window for vaccines against the rubella virus, which can lead to birth defects and miscarriages. The go-ahead for the HPV and rubella projects follows a successful meeting in London in June, when international donors pledged $4.3 billion to help the group with its work. GAVI says it has prevented more than 5.5 million child deaths in the last decade by bulk-buying vaccines against diseases such as pneumococcal pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae type b, or Hib disease, diphtheria, pertussis or whooping cough, tetanus, measles and rotavirus. With the move into HPV it will be buying a more complex and expensive vaccine than those used in existing programmes, paving the way for other similarly price-sensitive decisions in future. In a few years, GAVI will have to decide whether to buy the world’s first malaria vaccine, also developed by GSK and designed exclusively for use in the developing world. The vaccine, known as RTS,S or Mosquirix, halved the risk of five- to 17-month-olds getting the mosquito-borne disease in a recent clinical trial but the shot is no panacea, since it is less effective than vaccines against common infections such as polio and measles. Schwalbe said the RTS,S results to date were very encouraging but GAVI was waiting to see the outcome of using the vaccine in babies aged six to 12 weeks, expected in a year’s time, before taking any decisions. If all goes well, GSK believes the vaccine could reach the market in 2015.

138,MRK,Merck to pay $950 million to settle U.S. Vioxx charge,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co will pay roughly $950 million to settle criminal and civil charges that it promoted the painkiller Vioxx for an unapproved use, the U.S. Justice Department said on Tuesday. The fine will conclude a long-running investigation into Merck’s promotion of its one-time blockbuster drug, which was withdrawn from the market in September 2004 after being linked to heart risks. The Justice Department alleged that Merck promoted the drug for treating rheumatoid arthritis before it had been approved for that condition by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The case is one of the largest settlements by a major pharmaceutical company over marketing drugs in the United States for uses that have not been approved by the FDA, known as off-label promotion. “We will not hesitate to pursue those who skirt the proper drug approval process and make misleading statements about the safety and efficacy of their products,” said Tony West, the Justice Department’s assistant attorney general for the civil division, in a statement. Merck pled guilty to a misdemeanor charge and will pay a $321.6 million criminal fine for introducing the misbranded drug Vioxx into interstate commerce. It also agreed to pay an additional $628.4 million civil settlement to resolve additional allegations regarding its off-label marketing of Vioxx and alleged false statements about the pill’s heart safety. The U.S. government will recover $426 million of that amount, while the remainder will go to the states in the lawsuit. The Justice Department said Merck also agreed to a corporate integrity agreement to strengthen oversight over its marketing. Merck said the settlement does not mean it admits liability or wrongdoing. “We believe that Merck acted responsibly and in good faith in connection with the conduct at issue in these civil settlement agreements, including activities concerning the safety profile of Vioxx,” said Bruce Kuhlik, executive vice president and general counsel of Merck, in a statement. The large American drugmaker had already told investors in October 2010 it was taking a $950 million charge related to the U.S. government probe. The civil settlement agreement is signed with the United States and individually with 43 states and the District of Columbia, but previously disclosed litigation with seven states is still unresolved, Merck said. States have said the company misled regulators about the dangers associated with Vioxx, which has been linked in lawsuits to increasing users’ risk of heart attacks and other serious cardiovascular side effects. In 2007, Merck also agreed to pay $4.85 billion to settle lawsuits filed by thousands of former Vioxx users, who alleged the pill caused heart attacks.

The fine will conclude a long-running investigation into Merck’s promotion of its one-time blockbuster drug, which was withdrawn from the market in September 2004 after being linked to heart risks. The Justice Department alleged that Merck promoted the drug for treating rheumatoid arthritis before it had been approved for that condition by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The case is one of the largest settlements by a major pharmaceutical company over marketing drugs in the United States for uses that have not been approved by the FDA, known as off-label promotion. “We will not hesitate to pursue those who skirt the proper drug approval process and make misleading statements about the safety and efficacy of their products,” said Tony West, the Justice Department’s assistant attorney general for the civil division, in a statement. Merck pled guilty to a misdemeanor charge and will pay a $321.6 million criminal fine for introducing the misbranded drug Vioxx into interstate commerce. It also agreed to pay an additional $628.4 million civil settlement to resolve additional allegations regarding its off-label marketing of Vioxx and alleged false statements about the pill’s heart safety. The U.S. government will recover $426 million of that amount, while the remainder will go to the states in the lawsuit. The Justice Department said Merck also agreed to a corporate integrity agreement to strengthen oversight over its marketing. Merck said the settlement does not mean it admits liability or wrongdoing. “We believe that Merck acted responsibly and in good faith in connection with the conduct at issue in these civil settlement agreements, including activities concerning the safety profile of Vioxx,” said Bruce Kuhlik, executive vice president and general counsel of Merck, in a statement. The large American drugmaker had already told investors in Oct. 2010 it was taking a $950 million charge related to the U.S. government probe. The civil settlement agreement is signed with the United States and individually with 43 states and the District of Columbia, but previously disclosed litigation with seven states is still unresolved, Merck said. States have said the company misled regulators about the dangers associated with Vioxx, which has been linked in lawsuits to increasing users’ risk of heart attacks and other serious cardiovascular side effects. In 2007, Merck also agreed to pay $4.85 billion to settle lawsuits filed by thousands of former Vioxx users, who alleged the pill caused heart attacks.",11222011,http://www.reuters.com/article/doj-merck/update-2-merck-to-pay-950-mln-to-settle-us-vioxx-charge-idUSN1E7AL1PC20111122

141,MRK,Merck said to hijack German rival's Facebook page,"(Reuters) - German drugmaker Merck KGaA accused U.S. rival Merck & Co of hijacking its Facebook page and said it plans to sue to get it back. Merck KGaA asked a New York judge to force Facebook Inc to turn over information to help determine how the German company lost the page, www.facebook.com/merck , and the ability to administer it. According to a Monday filing with a New York state court in Manhattan, Merck KGaA contracted with Facebook in March 2010 for exclusive use of the page, but discovered last month that the unrelated Merck & Co was using it. Facebook “has not been cooperative” in restoring the page, and in several alleged communications appeared nonresponsive or evasive in dealing with Merck KGaA, the filing said. “Because Facebook is an important marketing device, the page is of great value to Merck, and its misappropriation is causing harm to Merck,” Merck KGaA said. “It is not clear how that happened or who is at fault nor ... is Facebook providing clear information about what happened.” Merck KGaA said it may bring legal action alleging breach of contract and interference with its business. It did not indicate whom it may sue. Merck & Co is not a defendant. Facebook spokesman Andrew Noyes and Merck & Co spokesman Ronald Rogers said their respective companies are looking into the matter. Merck KGaA declined to comment. According to Merck KGaA, the Mercks became separate companies under the Treaty of Versailles, each owning rights to the Merck trademark in different geographic areas, as part of Germany’s reparations following World War I.

144,MRK,UK switches to Merck's Gardasil for HPV vaccination,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is to stop using GlaxoSmithKline’s cervical cancer vaccine Cervarix from next September and will instead offer girls Merck & Co’s rival product Gardasil. The move underscores Gardasil’s lead in a $1 billion-plus worldwide market for vaccines that protect against the sexually transmitted human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause cervical cancer. The health ministry said Thursday the decision followed a competitive tendering exercise. GSK, however, said it had opted not to bid in the process because the government had made clear it wanted a vaccine offering broader protection. While both shots are effective, Gardasil targets four strains of HPV — two responsible for cervical cancer and two causing the less serious condition of genital warts — while Glaxo’s product addresses only the two cancer strains. Following a review of the various conditions caused by HPV, British health authorities placed additional emphasis on genital warts in the 2011 tender, effectively knocking Cervarix out of the competition. David Salisbury, the government’s director of immunization, said experts had weighed up both the cost and clinical benefits before deciding to switch to Gardasil. “We have reflected the changes in scientific knowledge that has become available since last time,” he told reporters. “They are not huge changes — we still prioritize the prevention of cancer — but based on all these things the winner is Gardasil.” Gardasil protects against the two strains of HPV virus that cause more than 70 percent of cervical cancer and two types that cause 90 percent of genital warts. GIRLS AGED 12-13 Under the British program, HPV vaccination is offered routinely to girls aged 12 to 13 years, with a catch-up program for those up to 18. Cervarix, from British-based GSK, has been the vaccine of choice since the program it was started in 2008 — but a number of critics said at the time that the decision was based on cost and Gardasil should have been chosen from the start. Gardasil is sold in Europe by Sanofi Pasteur MSD, a joint venture between U.S.-based Merck and French drugmaker Sanofi. A spokesman for Sanofi Pasteur MSD declined to comment on the price it was charging the British government. Globally, Gardasil outsells Cervarix, with revenues of $988 million last year and sales expected to reach $1.25 billion by 2015, according to Thomson Reuters Pharma data. Cervarix sales last year were 242 million pounds ($375 million) and are forecast to reach $848 million in 2015. GSK said at least 5 million doses of Cervarix had been administered in Britain up to July 2011 and the company remained committed to making the vaccine available around the world. Significant new demand for HPV vaccines could soon open up in the poor nations, following a decision last week by the GAVI international immunizations group to fund their roll-out in developing countries — provided it can reach a deal on pricing with the manufacturers.",11242011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-merck-sanofi-britain/uk-switches-to-mercks-gardasil-for-hpv-vaccination-idUSTRE7AN1TA20111124

Tony Falconer, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said he was delighted about the decision to switch to the quadrivalent vaccine. “Not only will it provide immunity against cervical cancer caused by HPV, it will also protect against the strains of HPV that cause genital warts, which are unpleasant and the cause of much psychological distress for sufferers,” he said in a statement.

147,MRK,Facebook apologizes for Merck homepage mix-up,"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc said on Monday that it made a mistake in letting Merck & Co take over a page on the social networking website from its German rival Merck KGaA.

In it, Merck KGaA sought to force Facebook to explain how it lost the page, www.facebook.com/merck, and the ability to administer it to Merck & Co, a separate company. Facebook plans to make the URL www.facebook.com/merck unavailable for use until both Mercks agree which company may use it. The companies may request other URLs and maintain presences on Facebook. “The transfer of the vanity URL Facebook.com/Merck from Merck KGaA to Merck & Co was due to an administrative error,” Facebook said in a statement. “We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.” Merck & Co spokesman Ronald Rogers said, “We are going to continue to have a Facebook page. It is an active webpage. We are continuing to look into the matter of the vanity URL.” A Merck KGaA spokesman said, “We are happy with Facebook’s apology, and we are still looking into the matter.” According to court papers, Merck KGaA contracted with Facebook in March 2010 for exclusive use of the page, but discovered last month that Merck & Co was using it. Merck KGaA said the loss of the page deprived it of an “important marketing device.” Merck & Co was not a defendant.

Kenneth Frazier, chairman of the trustees special committee and chief executive of Merck & Co, said he did not have a formal timetable for the investigation launched in November and headed by former FBI director and federal judge Louis Freeh. “I would hope that it would be done by the end of this academic year so we could come back in the new academic year and have all of that behind us, but I can’t put a timetable on it,” Frazier said at The Wall Street Journal Viewpoints breakfast meeting in New York. The Penn State academic year finishes in the spring of 2012. Several investigations, including the internal probe, have been launched surrounding the allegations against former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, who was charged in November with multiple counts of sexually abusing young boys. Sandusky, who faces 52 charges of molesting 10 boys over a decade, on Tuesday waived his right to a preliminary hearing on the charges against him, allowing the case to go straight to trial. He has said he is innocent of the charges. Two former university officials who were charged in an alleged cover-up also maintain their innocence. Days after the charges became public, Penn State trustees fired legendary coach Joe Paterno and the university president for failing to tell police about one allegation of abuse. Penn State hired former FBI director Louis Freeh to help in the investigation. Frazier said the probe was in its early stages and Freeh had “free rein. Frazier’s experience leading Merck’s defense of lawsuits over the recall of arthritis drug Vioxx made him the choice to serve as chairman of the special committee, he said. Merck was seen as successful in its defense of the lawsuits because the ultimate liabilities were lower than some on Wall Street initially had expected. Frazier said many people focused on the financial cost of the Vioxx lawsuits, but within Merck it was seen as a defense of the institution. “So too is Penn State an important institution,” Frazier said. “I took on that responsibility because I believe in the institution ... This is a horrible situation that occurred but it doesn’t define that university. “I don’t know what the facts will ultimately be, but I think it’s important in times like this that people step up and remind people of the value of an institution to the country and that’s how I see my responsibility.” ",12132011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-penn-state-probe/head-of-penn-state-probe-hopes-it-will-finish-in-spring-idUSTRE7BC23V20111213

160,MRK,"Merck profit beats expectations on lower R&D;, taxes","(Reuters) - Merck & Co (MRK.N) posted higher-than-expected quarterly earnings due to lower taxes and research spending, and the No. 2 U.S. drugmaker said profit would be little changed in 2012 as it girds for cheaper generic forms of its biggest product, asthma drug Singulair. Merck on Thursday posted a fourth-quarter net profit of $1.51 billion, or 49 cents per share, compared with a loss of $531 million, or 17 cents a share, a year ago, when it took a $1.7 billion charge related to a major clinical setback. Excluding items, including acquisition and restructuring expenses, Merck earned 97 cents per share. Analysts, on average, expected 95 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “Merck is rapidly adapting to the coming Singulair loss, but as we go into 2012 it needs to look more carefully at its sales, general and administrative costs,” said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover, who noted significantly higher spending in those areas during the quarter. Global company revenue rose 2 percent to $12.29 billion, just shy of Wall Street expectations of $12.53 billion. Earnings were damped by weak sales of arthritis treatment Remicade but bolstered by research spending that came in $145 million below Wall Street estimates, said Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst with ISI Group. JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott said the earnings beat was largely due to a lower tax rate and noted that company sales did not eclipse forecasts as they have over the past year. Even so, Schott predicted in a research report that Merck earnings will grow by an average of 7 percent a year through 2017 and be in the industry’s top tier, despite Singulair’s decline, as the company introduces new medicines. Quarterly sales of Singulair, whose U.S. patent lapses in August, jumped 8 percent to almost $1.5 billion, well above any other Merck product. Sales of its Januvia diabetes drug soared 42 percent to $960 million, while a related combination product called Janumet rose 34 percent to $386 million — suggesting the fast-growing diabetes franchise will be able to help offset Singulair’s approaching decline. “Januvia franchise growth was massive in 2011,” said Credit-Suisse analyst Catherine Arnold, who added the trend bodes well for future Merck profits. Sales of Remicade fell 28 percent to $511 million following arbitration that assigned rival drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) a wider sales territory for the medicine. Merck acquired the widely used product in 2009 through its purchase of Schering Plough, which had sold it under a long-standing arrangement with J&J.; Merck said it expects to seek approvals of five new medicines between 2012 and 2013. They include two products that have been delayed for years by regulators: Bridion, to reverse the effects of anesthesia, and Tredaptive, a form of niacin meant to raise “good” HDL cholesterol without causing facial flushing. The company said it expects full-year 2012 earnings of $3.75 to $3.85 per share, excluding special items. Analysts, on average, expect $3.83 per share. The forecast reflects earnings 0.5 percent lower to 2.1 percent higher than those reported for 2011. The drugmaker earned $3.77 in 2011, excluding items. Merck has trimmed research spending while avoiding the deep cuts that rivals like Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) have implemented to prop up earnings. Merck said its R&D; spending this year should remain at about 2011 levels. ",2022012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-merck/merck-profit-beats-expectations-on-lower-rd-taxes-idUSTRE81110X20120202

162,MRK,UPDATE 2-Merck clot pill hits goal; brain bleeding dogs drug,"* Pill cuts heart attacks, after missing mark in prior study * Merck says reviewing possible marketing application * Analyst says drug prospects dim due to renewed bleeding * Company shares little changed Feb 7 (Reuters) - Merck & Co experimental blood thinner Vorapaxar met the main goal of significantly reducing clots and related cardiovascular problems in a large clinical study, but results were marred by the same bleeding risks seen in a large earlier trial. The No. 2 U.S. drugmaker provided only general results of its so-called TRA-2P study on Tuesday, saying details will be presented at the American College of Cardiology scientific meeting in March. Merck said it would review the data from both late-stage trials to determine next steps, including possibly seeking approval for the oral blood clot preventer. The company said patients receiving the medicine in combination with standard treatment had significantly lower combined risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack, stroke or the need for artery-opening procedures than those who received standard treatment alone. But Merck said there was a significant increase in bleeding, including brain hemorrhage, although there was a lower risk of such hemorrhage in patients without a history of stroke. “We do not yet know the magnitude of the efficacy nor the bleeding risk in these patients,” ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said in a research report. Schoenebaum said the effectiveness of the drug in the trial was a positive surprise, but added that it had virtually no chance of reaching the market due to reappearance of bleeding risk. Prospects for Vorapaxar, once deemed a potential $3 billion-a-year product, have dimmed in the past year due to a pair of setbacks. In November, it failed in another big trial to reduce the same types of cardiovascular events, while tripling the risk of bleeding in the brain. In early 2011, an independent safety monitoring board deemed the drug inappropriate for patients who had suffered a stroke because of bleeding risk. But Merck, which ranks behind Pfizer Inc, has held out hope that the drug’s overall safety and effectiveness would be proven in ongoing trials and give it an important place in some treatment groups. Merck obtained Vorapaxar through its $41 billion acquisition in late 2009 of rival drugmaker Schering Plough. At the time, it was considered the crown jewel of Schering Plough’s drug pipeline, but bleeding risks emerged barely a year after the merger. Shares of Merck were down less than 0.1 percent at $38.38 in morning trading.",2072012,http://www.reuters.com/article/merck/update-2-merck-clot-pill-hits-goal-brain-bleeding-dogs-drug-idUSL4E8D75VZ20120207
163,MRK,Merck says hepatitis pill hampers HIV Drugs,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co’s recently approved Victrelis treatment for hepatitis C considerably lessens the effectiveness of some widely used medicines against the virus that causes AIDS, Merck and U.S. regulators said in separate reports. “These drug interactions may be clinically significant for patients infected with both chronic hepatitis C virus and HIV by potentially reducing the effectiveness of these medicines when co-administered,” Merck said in a February 6 letter to healthcare professionals. Victrelis, approved last May, attacks the hepatitis C virus that over decades can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. A significant percentage of hepatitis patients are also infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which weakens the immune system and is fatal without treatment. The drug interactions were seen in a study among healthy volunteers who took Victrelis and the widely used HIV treatment Norvir in combination with one of three other anti-HIV pills: Reyataz (atazanavir), Prezista (darunavir) and Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir). All of the HIV drugs work by blocking protease, an enzyme the virus requires to replicate. Victrelis reduced concentrations in the blood of Reyataz, Prezista and Kaletra by an average 49 percent, 59 percent and 43 percent, respectively. Further, levels of Victrelis itself were reduced by 45 percent among volunteers who took it with Kaletra, and 32 percent among those who took it with a combination of Norvir and Prezista. ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said 10 percent to 15 percent of patients with hepatitis C are co-infected with HIV, and the findings could crimp Victrelis sales by as much as 25 percent. But he said the setback would have little impact on Merck’s earnings this year or in 2013. The reduced prospects for Victrelis come even as its sales are being dwarfed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc’s Incivek, a rival protease inhibitor that was also approved last May. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in an announcement of the findings that appeared on the agency’s website on Wednesday, said patients should not stop taking any of their medicines without talking to healthcare professionals. Drug interactions had previously been found between Victrelis and another HIV treatment called Sustiva (efavirenz). Sustiva belongs to a family of HIV drugs called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Merck said it was conducting drug-interaction studies of Victrelis with other HIV drugs. They include Intelence (etravirine), which is also a NNRTI, and Isentress (raltegravir), which belongs to a class of drugs called HIV integrase inhibitors, Merck shares slid 14 cents to $38.28 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

164,MRK,"Top trial lawyer departs Dechert for Weil, Gotshal","* Diane Sullivan focuses on class actions and consumer fraud * Clients have included Merck, AstraZeneca and Philip Morris By Leigh Jones Feb 13 (Reuters) - Top product liability trial lawyer Diane Sullivan has joined the elite law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges from Dechert. Sullivan, who focuses on class actions, consumer fraud, life sciences, and other complex commercial disputes, joined Dechert in 2001. Her clients have included top pharmaceutical manufacturers Merck and AstraZeneca, as well as tobacco giant Philip Morris USA, a subsdiary of Altria Group. She started at Weil on Monday as a partner in the firm’s litigation department. Sullivan, 49, said Weil had been calling her “for about two years” asking her to consider moving from Dechert. “It was a very difficult decision, but it’s a terrific opportunity to be an even better trial lawyer,” she said. Moving with Sullivan to Weil is Kathleen O’Connor, also a  partner at Dechert. O’Connor, 46, focuses on complex commercial disputes, consumer fraud, mass torts and product liability. She was assistant in-house counsel at Merck from 2002 to 2006. She joined Dechert in 2006. Last year, Sullivan, an aggressive litigator, won a verdict for Philip Morris, which was defending against a $455 million lawsuit in Missouri state court brought by 37 hospitals. The hospitals claimed that Philip Morris and other cigarette makers were liable for defective design and should be responsible for paying indigent patients’ healthcare costs. In 2010, Sullivan scored a verdict for Seroquel manufacturer, AstraZeneca, in New Jersey state court. The plaintiff, a Vietnam veteran, claimed that the company failed to warn doctors that the antipsychotic drug caused patients to become diabetic.  A jury found that the warnings to the doctors were sufficient. Sullivan also represented Merck & Co. in a closely watched 2005 New Jersey trial before Judge Carol Higbee over whether arthritis painkiller Vioxx caused a postal worker’s heart attack.  The jury found that Merck fairly warned of the drug’s safety risks and did not commit consumer fraud. Sullivan clashed several times with Higbee during the 2005 Vioxx trial and again during a 2007 Vioxx trial over similar claims. In the 2007 trial, Higbee held Sullivan in contempt and fined her $1,000 for her questioning tactics during cross-examination. The judge later threw out the contempt order and fine for reasons that were unclear. Peggy Heffner, a spokeswoman for Dechert, said in a statement that Sullivan and O’Connor “have been valued members of our firm for many years. New York-based Weil, Gotshal & Manges has about 1,150 lawyers in 20 offices worldwide.

166,MRK,FDA may fine Merck for lack of diabetes study,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. drug regulators may fine Merck for failing to test whether its diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet can raise the risk of an inflamed pancreas, according to a warning letter posted online on Tuesday. Merck agreed to do a post-approval study of the drugs in mice to see if they increase the risk of acute pancreatitis, the Food and Drug Administration said in a warning letter dated February 17. Pancreatitis can be deadly if it is not treated. The FDA sometimes requires companies to conduct additional trials of a drug after it is approved to resolve any uncertainty about safety. A company that fails to comply may be fined up to “Your product is considered misbranded because you are in violation of a postmarketing requirement,” Leslie Ball, acting director of the FDA’s office of scientific investigations, in the letter to Merck. “You have failed to comply with the approved timetable ... and failed to show good cause for not conducting the additional testing required.” Merck’s blockbuster pill Januvia and the related drug Janumet help lower blood sugar levels in people who have type 2 diabetes, the kind linked to poor diet and lack of exercise. The FDA approved Januvia in 2006, but later got reports of patients who developed an inflamed pancreas after taking the medicine. The agency asked Merck to study the link and see if its medicine was causing the problem. Janumet pairs Januvia’s drug, known generically as sitagliptin, with a widely used, older, generic medicine called metformin, which also helps to control blood sugar. Merck has said all people with diabetes are more likely to develop pancreatitis, even without medication. But Merck agreed to give sitagliptin to mice for three months to test pancreatic safety, the FDA said. The company was supposed to submit its study design to the FDA by June 15, 2010, and submit a final report by June 15, 2011. Merck failed to submit a study design, and said it would be relying on an independent study to look at safety, even though the FDA never agreed to this, the agency said. In a statement on its website on Tuesday, Merck promised to submit a final study design to the FDA within 30 days from the time it received the FDA letter, and to start the study within six months. “Merck takes its responsibility to comply with FDA regulations very seriously, and is thoroughly reviewing its processes and procedures to ensure that Merck fulfills its commitments to the FDA going forward,” the company said in the statement. An analysis of medical claims data from June 2010 showed Merck’s Januvia and Byetta, by Amylin Pharmaceuticals and partner Eli Lilly & Co, posed no additional risk for an inflamed pancreas compared to other diabetes drugs. The analysis was conducted by pharmacy benefit manager Medco Health Solutions, in association with the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School.

167,MRK,"FDA adds diabetes, memory loss warnings to statins","(Reuters) - U.S. health regulators will add warnings to the labels of widely used cholesterol lowering drugs, such as Lipitor, to indicate that they may raise levels of blood sugar and could cause memory loss. The Food and Drug administration announced the changes to the safety information on the labels of statins such as Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor, AstraZeneca’s Crestor and Merck & Co’s Zocor. Statins have been shown to significantly reduce the risk of heart attack and heart disease, and the FDA said the new information should not scare people into stopping taking the drugs. “The value of statins in preventing heart disease has been clearly established,” Amy Egan, deputy director for safety in FDA’s Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology Products, said in a statement. “Their benefit is indisputable, but they need to be taken with care and knowledge of their side effects.” Lipitor, which became available late last year in generic form as atorvastatin, is the world’s all-time biggest selling prescription medicine with cumulative sales of over $130 billion. The generic version of Zocor, simvastatin, in 2010 was the second most widely prescribed drug in the United States, according to IMS Health. The FDA said it was aware of studies in which some patients taking statins may have a small increased risk of higher blood sugar levels and of being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The statin labels will also now reflect reports of certain cognitive effects such as memory loss and confusion experienced by some patients taking the drugs, the agency said. It said those reports generally have not been serious and the symptoms were reversed by stopping use of the statin. One safety warning long associated with the class of medicines will be reversed, the FDA said: Patients taking statins will no longer need routine periodic monitoring of liver enzymes. “FDA has concluded that serious liver injury with statins is rare and unpredictable in individual patients, and that routine periodic monitoring of liver enzymes does not appear to be effective in detecting or preventing this rare side effect,” it said. Other statins, most of which are available as generics, include Livalo, Mevacor, Pravachol, Altoprev and Lescol. There are also combination medicines that include statins, such as Merck’s Vytorin and Abbott Laboratories’ Simcor. The agency also said Merck’s Mevacor, the world’s first approved statin, known generically as lovastatin, should never be taken with certain drugs used to treat HIV and certain bacterial and fungal infections due to increased risk of a serious muscle disease.

168,MRK,Merck says pill tames allergic response to ragweed,"* Says pill may be alternative to allergy shots * Says cut allergy symptoms, need for other drugs * Says pill trains immune system to overlook ragweed By Ransdell Pierson March 4 (Reuters) - Merck & Co on Sunday said it would seek U.S. approvals next year for separate allergy pills that help tame the immune system’s reaction to ragweed and grass, and the drugmaker released favorable data from a late-stage trial of the ragweed medicine. The pills are meant to be an alternative to traditional allergy shots given in doctors’ offices, which include a mixture of proteins that gradually weaken the immune system’s response to ragweed, grass, foods and other allergy triggers. The Phase III study involved 565 patients 18 to 50 years old prone to ragweed-induced allergies, with or without asthma. Patients took Merck’s once-daily tablet for 52 weeks, at one of two available doses, or took placebos. The active ingredient of the pill is Ambrosia artemisifolia, the chemical name of the ragweed allergen, or protein, that causes runny noses, sneezing and other miseries for millions of Americans. The study assessed relief of nasal and eye symptoms as well as reductions in the need for other allergy medications, which together were considered in the total combined score. During peak ragweed season, patients taking Merck’s pill experienced 27 percent and 21 percent reductions in the total combined score, respectively, at the higher and lower doses, compared with patients taking placebos. Merck said the results were highly statistically significant. Specifically, the pill reduced allergy symptoms during peak ragweed season by 17 percent and 14 percent, respectively, at the higher and lower doses. It reduced the need for standard allergy medications — including antihistamines and nasal steroids such as Nasonex — by 45 percent and 34 percent, respectively, at the two doses. The most frequent side effects of the treatment were itchiness of the mouth and ear and throat irritation, Merck said, with no reports of death, systemic allergic reactions or life-threatening events. But two patients during the trial received epinephrine, an injectable hormone often used to treat serious allergic reactions to drugs, foods or other substances. Additional details about the treatments with epinephrine were not immediately available. Merck sells many of the world’s most widely used standard allergy treatments, including Nasonex and Claritin, an antihistamine sold over the counter by the U.S. drugmaker and other companies under the chemical name loratadine. Rupert Vessey, head of respiratory and immunology research at Merck, said favorable data have also been seen in separate studies of the company’s medicine to moderate grass allergies. It and the ragweed product are the first pills to attack the underlying cause of allergy attacks, while current drugs just treat allergy symptoms, he said in an interview. “Immune therapy actually modifies the disease. It educates the immune system to get rid of allergic responder cells, and to become tolerant of allergens,” Vassey said. He said pills would be far more convenient than allergy shots because patients would not have to make repeated visits to doctors or undergo injections. Moreover, he said shots given by allergists contain allergens that are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Vassey said allergy shots typically are taken for about three years, after which many patients experience relief for years afterward. By the same token, he said Merck’s pills, if approved, might also be taken for an extended period to tame immune responses, before patients stop treatment. When asked how symptom relief with the pills compares with relief seen with Claritin and other standard therapies, Vessey declined to provide statistics. He said it would be inappropriate to compare effectiveness of the Merck pills with other classes of allergy medicines because they had not been tested against each other. Merck is developing the allergy immunotherapies with Danish drugmaker ALK-Abello. Data from the ragweed trial were to be presented at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology being held in Orlando.",3042012,http://www.reuters.com/article/embargoed-merck-allergy/merck-says-pill-tames-allergic-response-to-ragweed-idUSL2E8E2EY320120304

171,MRK,"Vertex, Merck hepatitis drugs work in HIV patients","SEATTLE (Reuters) - Rival hepatitis C drugs from Merck & Co and Vertex Pharmaceuticals are effective in patients also infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, according to data released on Tuesday. The Vertex drug had the more impressive results, the data showed. The results from midstage trials may raise questions about a notification last month from U.S. regulators and Merck that use of the company’s Victrelis drug in such “co-infected” patients could lessen the effectiveness of some widely used medicines for human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. Both Victrelis, also known as boceprevir, and Vertex’s Incivek, or telaprevir, are protease inhibitors designed to block an enzyme that the hepatitis C virus requires to replicate. Vertex said 74 percent of trial patients treated with Incivek followed by the standard regimen of interferon and ribavirin were free of the hepatitis C virus, or HCV, 12 weeks after ending treatment, compared with 45 percent of patients given interferon and ribavirin alone. There were no instances of a rebound of HIV for patients in the Incivek trial. Side effects seen more frequently with that drug were itching, headache, nausea, rash, fever and depression. No cases of severe rash were reported. Merck’s mid-stage trial found that 63.9 percent of patients treated with Victrelis and the standard hepatitis C therapy were free of HCV at 48 weeks of treatment, compared with 29.4 percent of patients treated only with interferon and ribavirin. Two patients on Victrelis and three in the control group had an increase in HIV. The Victrelis numbers will be updated to reflect the 12-week post-treatment mark at a presentation in Seattle at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections later on Tuesday. “The drugs that are used to treat HIV have certain metabolic effects,” said Eliav Barr, Merck’s vice president, infectious diseases. “You have to be careful not to mess with those drug levels.” Barr estimated that between 15 percent and 20 percent of U.S. HIV patients are also infected with HCV, a liver-destroying virus which has come to be a leading cause of death for HIV patients. In the first half of this year, Merck plans to start a larger, pivotal trial of Victrelis in a broader range of HIV patients, with those results expected a couple of years later, Barr said. The company is also conducting a number of drug interaction studies. Vertex said it was currently enrolling patients in a late-stage study of Incivek combination regimens in people also infected with HCV and HIV. The company also said laboratory studies of Incivek and HIV protease inhibitors had found no harmful effects on antiviral activity when combined with HIV medicines Agenerase (amprenavir) from GlaxoSmithKline Plc, Prezista (darunavir) from Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen unit and lopinavir. Slight antagonistic effects were observed on the antiviral activity of Reyataz (atazanavir) from Bristol-Myers Squibb. Merck said last month that a study among healthy volunteers showed Victrelis as lessening the effect of a combination of HIV drug Norvir (ritonavir) from Abbott Laboratories with one of three other anti-HIV pills: Reyataz, Prezista and Abbott’s Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir).",3062012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-vertex/vertex-merck-hepatitis-drugs-work-in-hiv-patients-idUSTRE8251RO20120306

Both Victrelis, also known as boceprevir, and Vertex’s Incivek, or telaprevir, are protease inhibitors designed to block an enzyme that the hepatitis C virus requires to replicate. Since key HIV drugs are also protease inhibitors, which use the same pathway as the new hepatitis C drugs, there is a potential for drug interaction, said Dr. Douglas Dietrich, professor of medicine at New York’s Mount Sinai School of Medicine and lead investigator on the Incivek trial. He said 74 percent of trial patients treated with Incivek followed by the standard regimen of interferon and ribavirin were free of the hepatitis C virus, or HCV, 12 weeks after ending treatment, compared with 45 percent of patients given interferon and ribavirin alone. There were no instances of a rebound of HIV for patients in the Incivek trial. Side effects seen more frequently with the drug were itching, headache, nausea, rash, fever and depression.

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1.2 million Americans have HIV, and one in five adults with HIV do not know they are infected. Vertex said laboratory studies of Incivek and HIV protease inhibitors had found no harmful effects on antiviral activity when combined with HIV medicines Agenerase (amprenavir) from GlaxoSmithKline Plc, Prezista (darunavir) from Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen unit and lopinavir. Slight antagonistic effects were observed on the antiviral activity of Reyataz (atazanavir) from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Merck said last month that a study among healthy volunteers showed Victrelis as lessening the effect of a combination of HIV drug Norvir (ritonavir) from Abbott Laboratories Inc with one of three other anti-HIV pills: Reyataz, Prezista and Abbott’s Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir). In afternoon trading, Vertex shares were down 77 cents or 1.9 percent to $39.63 and Merck shares were down $1.04 or 2.7 percent to $37.41 As the broad market fell.

The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, which often spurns expensive new medicines on cost grounds, said significant improvements seen with Victrelis made it a cost-effective option. The drug, also known as boceprevir, is designed for use in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for patients with liver disease due to genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C, the most common form. It costs 30,800 pounds ($48,400) for a 44-week course, with the other two drugs increasing the bill by around 11,000 pounds.

A staff review document released by the Food and Drug Administration also said the treatment known by the brand name Taltorvic showed no new or unexpected safety signals in clinical research. The drug will come before an advisory panel of outside experts on Tuesday. The panel could recommend it for FDA approval. The FDA will consider the panel’s findings in rendering a final decision. Sarcomas are a group of aggressive cancers of connective tissues of the body. The National Cancer Institute estimates about 11,000 Americans were diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma in 2011, and about 4,000 of them died from the disease. Bone sarcoma, which forms in cells of the bone, will affect about 2,890 people in the United States in 2012 and kill 1,400 of them, the Institute estimates. Merck is developing the drug with smaller company Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc as a maintenance therapy for adults, and for pediatric patients aged 13 through 17, who have completed at least four cycles of chemotherapy without evidence of disease progression. Federal officials granted the drug orphan status, meaning it treats a disease that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States.

177,MRK,FDA staff question benefit of Merck-Ariad drug,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. drug reviewers questioned whether a sarcoma treatment from Merck & Co Inc and Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc kept tumors at bay for long enough, given the drug’s serious side effects. The drug, called Taltorvic, is meant as a maintenance therapy for people with soft tissue or bone sarcoma who have had four successful rounds of chemotherapy. U.S. Food and Drug Administration staff found the drug stopped cancer from spreading two weeks longer than a placebo, according to FDA documents posted online on Friday. But the drug had serious safety issues, such as kidney failure, infection and inflamed lung tissue, the documents said. About 14 percent of patients discontinued treatment because of side effects, compared with 2 percent of patients who stopped taking the placebo. “The number of patients who discontinued due to an adverse event is of particular concern in a drug intended for use as maintenance therapy,” the FDA staff said in the documents. Maintenance therapies help people stay disease-free once their cancer is in remission. There are currently no FDA-approved maintenance therapies for sarcoma. A panel of outside experts to the FDA will vote on whether to recommend approval of Taltorvic on Tuesday, and the FDA will later make the final decision. Ariad shares fell 4 percent to $14.83 on Nasdaq, compared with a slight rise in the Arca pharmaceuticals index. Shares of the bigger Merck were up 0.4 percent at $38.20 on the New York Stock Exchange. Cory Kasimov, an analyst at J.P. Morgan, said the documents were not a big surprise, as other drugs in the same class as Taltorvic have similar safety issues. “We ... believe Tuesday’s panel will come down to whether the panel sees the unmet medical need overcoming Taltorvic’s modest absolute benefit and (adverse event) profile,” Kasimov said in a research note. Sarcomas are a group of aggressive cancers of connective tissues of the body. The National Cancer Institute estimates about 11,000 Americans were diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma in 2011, and about 4,000 of them died from the disease.

In clinical trials, Taltorvic kept cancer at bay for 16.1 weeks, compared with 14 weeks in patients treated with a placebo, according to the FDA staff. Merck had slightly different calculations, showing the drug’s effect was 17.7 weeks, compared with 14.6 weeks for the placebo.

182,MRK,FDA panel splits recommendations on sarcoma drugs,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recommended GlaxoSmithKline Plc’s Votrient for soft-tissue sarcoma on Tuesday, but did not recommend a treatment for the same malady developed jointly by Merck & Co Inc and Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc. The FDA committee of outside experts voted 11-2 in finding that Votrient’s ability to improve short-term survival without worsening symptoms in patients who receive chemotherapy outweighed adverse risks and a lack of evidence that it can extend overall survival. The same panel voted 13-1 not to recommend Merck’s drug Taltorvic for soft-tissue and bone sarcoma after reviewing data that associated the drug with serious adverse effects but produced only small improvements in patients who had completed at least four cycles of chemotherapy. The regulatory agency will now consider the committee’s recommendations in reaching separate decisions on whether each drug should be approved for sale in the United States for soft-tissue sarcoma. An FDA official said the agency could give Votrient accelerated approval to ensure further study of the drug’s efficacy, including questions about patient quality of life, on patients with soft-tissue sarcoma. The drug is already approved for renal cell carcinoma. Shares of GlaxoSmithKline closed 0.2 percent higher at 1433.5 pence in London trading after the panel made its recommendation for Votrient. The committee’s vote on Taltorvic occurred as share trading closed in New York, with Merck down 13 cents at $37.76 and Ariad shares off 18 cents at $15.05. Soft-tissue sarcoma is a rare but aggressive form of cancer that afflicted about 11,000 Americans last year, 4,000 of whom died from the disease, according to the National Cancer Institute. FDA committee members said they were willing to consider treatments shown in clinical trials to be only marginally effective because the disease is so aggressive and alternative treatments so few. That was part of the rationale behind the panel’s recommendation for Glaxo’s Votrient, which was shown to allow patients to survive three months longer on average, without disease progression, compared with subjects who received a placebo, but showed no significant improvement in overall survival rates. Committee members were less charitable toward Taltorvic, which is also known by the chemical name ridoforolimus, which was shown to improve survival without disease progression by only a matter of weeks but with adverse impacts including death and hospitalization. Panelists noted findings that four out of five patients who participated in the Taltorvic study experienced adverse effects severe enough for the treatment to be scaled back or discontinued. “How is it clinically meaningful to expose patients, for far longer than they should need to be, to a toxic drug for the benefit of three weeks?” asked the panel’s chairman, Dr. Wyndham Wilson of the National Cancer Institute. Adverse events from Talrovic included pneumonitis, renal failure, pneumonia and other infections as well as hyperglycemia. Matthew Alsante, executive director of the Sarcoma Foundation of America, implored panel members to approve both drugs, saying sarcoma patients have few alternative treatments for fending off worsening symptoms and death.

184,MRK,Merck blood clot drug in limbo after mixed results,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Impressive efficacy but worrisome bleeding was seen for a new type of blood clot preventer tested by Merck & Co in one of the largest heart-drug studies ever conducted, researchers said on Saturday, raising questions whether the company will seek approval of the drug and whether it can pass muster with regulators. Vorapaxar has been dogged by bleeding concerns since January 2011, when a safety committee overseeing the 26,449-patient study said the new type of anti-platelet drug was not appropriate for patients who had suffered a stroke, due to bleeding risk. But Merck was allowed to press ahead with the trial, called TRA-2P, after discontinuing treatment for patients with a history of stroke. It continued to test patients who were in stable condition after having heart attacks or being diagnosed with clogged leg arteries, to see if vorapaxar could prevent future heart attacks and stroke. The drugmaker last month provided limited data from the study, saying patients were benefiting from vorapaxar. But it noted they were experiencing excessive bleeding, as was seen in a separate earlier trial called TRACER that involved almost 13,000 patients who derived no protective benefit from vorapaxar. Merck officials, in an interview, declined to comment on whether the company will seek approval of vorapaxar, given the mixed results of the latest trial and failure of the earlier TRACER study. They also would not say whether Merck might conduct a costly new study assessing only patients with heart-attack histories - the group that was best protected by the drug in the most recent study. “We are extremely excited by the results,” said Francis Plat, Merck’s head of cardiovascular clinical research. “This is a positive trial.” But ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said he continued to have dim hopes for the medicine despite its effectiveness in the study. “We have zero in our model for it,” he said, referring to his sales expectations for vorapaxar. He said the drug, even if approved, would only be used by a “minimal” number of patients because of bleeding risks. Researchers on Saturday said vorapaxar, when used for an average of 30 months with standard anti-platelet medicines like aspirin and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s Plavix, met its main trial goal. It did so, they said, by causing a 13 percent reduction in the combined risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack and stroke compared to those receiving standard treatment and a placebo. “This is the first time we’ve seen the addition of any new type of anti-platelet drug provide additional long-term protection among stable patients with a history of heart attack,” said Dr. David Morrow, a cardiologist from Brigham & Women’s Hospital in Boston who led the trial. He said vorapaxar was not deemed effective in protecting patients that had previous strokes or clogged leg arteries. But he said it was responsible for an impressive 20 percent reduction in combined cardiovascular death, heart attack and stroke among the almost 18,000 patients in the trial who were enrolled after having heart attacks. “This is the most important finding in the trial - that there is this clinically compelling benefit in this group with previous heart attacks,” Morrow said in an interview. Morrow added that more than 8 million Americans have a history of heart attacks and another 1 million suffer heart attacks each year. “So, it’s a broad group of patients.” But he said 2.4 percent of patients in the latest trial with prior strokes experienced brain bleeding, compared with 0.9 percent of those receiving placebos. “There’s clearly a tradeoff here between the protective benefit and the risk of bleeding,” Morrow said. Should the drug be approved, he said the challenge for doctors would be to withhold it from patients at likely higher bleeding risk - including those with a history of stroke and those over 75 years of age. Morrow was to present his full findings Saturday at the annual scientific meeting of the American College of Cardiology in Chicago. Some 4.2 percent of all patients enrolled in the study who took vorapaxar had moderate or severe bleeding, significantly higher than the 2.5 percent in the placebo group. Roughly 1 percent taking the Merck drug had bleeding in the brain, twice the percentage of those receiving only standard treatment. Risk of brain bleeding was far less pronounced among patients who had no history of stroke - with an incidence of 0.6 percent for those on vorapaxar, compared with 0.4 percent in the placebo group. Although the incidence of overall severe bleeding among patients with no stroke history was statistically similar in the vorapaxar and placebo groups, moderate bleeding was twice as frequent in those taking vorapaxar - at 2.7 percent. Merck’s Plat said Merck will continue discussions with the researchers for both vorapaxar studies, as well as outside experts, to assess the drug’s potential, and in which populations. But he declined to comment when asked when Merck might signal next steps, if any, for the drug. ISI Group’s Schoenebaum predicted Merck will decide within the next several months whether to continue development. Merck obtained vorapaxar through its $41 billion acquisition in late 2009 of rival Schering Plough. At the time it was considered the crown jewel of Schering Plough’s drug pipeline.

187,MRK,"FDA adds diabetes, memory loss warnings to statins","(Reuters) - U.S. health regulators will add warnings to the labels of widely used cholesterol lowering drugs, such as Lipitor, to indicate that they may raise levels of blood sugar and could cause memory loss. The Food and Drug administration announced the changes to the safety information on the labels of statins such as Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor, AstraZeneca’s Crestor and Merck & Co’s Zocor. Statins have been shown to significantly reduce the risk of heart attack and heart disease, and the FDA said the new information should not scare people into stopping taking the drugs. “The value of statins in preventing heart disease has been clearly established,” Amy Egan, deputy director for safety in FDA’s Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology Products, said in a statement. “Their benefit is indisputable, but they need to be taken with care and knowledge of their side effects.” Lipitor, which became available late last year in generic form as atorvastatin, is the world’s all-time biggest selling prescription medicine with cumulative sales of over $130 billion. The generic version of Zocor, simvastatin, in 2010 was the second most widely prescribed drug in the United States, according to IMS Health. The FDA said it was aware of studies in which some patients taking statins may have a small increased risk of higher blood sugar levels and of being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The statin labels will also now reflect reports of certain cognitive effects such as memory loss and confusion experienced by some patients taking the drugs, the agency said. It said those reports generally have not been serious and the symptoms were reversed by stopping use of the statin. One safety warning long associated with the class of medicines will be reversed, the FDA said: Patients taking statins will no longer need routine periodic monitoring of liver enzymes. “FDA has concluded that serious liver injury with statins is rare and unpredictable in individual patients, and that routine periodic monitoring of liver enzymes does not appear to be effective in detecting or preventing this rare side effect,” it said. Other statins, most of which are available as generics, include Livalo, Mevacor, Pravachol, Altoprev and Lescol. There are also combination medicines that include statins, such as Merck’s Vytorin and Abbott Laboratories’ Simcor. The agency also said Merck’s Mevacor, the world’s first approved statin, known generically as lovastatin, should never be taken with certain drugs used to treat HIV and certain bacterial and fungal infections due to increased risk of a serious muscle disease.

188,MRK,UPDATE 1-Merck says key Vytorin study cleared to continue,"* No results given for interim look at Improve-It trial * Merck says safety monitors to look at data in 9 months By Lewis Krauskopf March 28 (Reuters) - A closely watched study of Merck & Co Inc’s Vytorin cholesterol treatment was cleared to continue by safety monitors, the drugmaker said on Wednesday. Wall Street has been eagerly anticipating the interim report for the 18,000-patient Improve-It study to see whether Vytorin is helping improve heart outcomes, and thereby increase sales for the franchise. However, Merck did not release any data on Wednesday, saying it has not seen the results of the interim analysis. It said only that the safety monitors overseeing the trial recommended it continue without change and that they plan to review the data again in about nine months. Vytorin is a combination of Merck’s older statin cholesterol fighter Zocor and Zetia, a newer medicine which cuts bad “LDL” cholesterol through a different pathway. Vytorin and Zetia tallied sales of $4.3 billion combined last year, or about 9 percent of Merck’s total, but product sales have somewhat stalled since a 2008 study called Enhance raised questions about their effectiveness. Investors have been hoping that the Improve-It trial could revive fortunes for the products, whose prospects are even more challenged now that Pfizer Inc’s blockbuster Lipitor statin is available as a low-cost generic. In the Improve-It study, patients with acute coronary syndrome are being given either Vytorin or Zocor, which is now available as a generic and is also known as simvastatin. The study is examining whether Vytorin reduces risk of death, heart attacks and strokes. The safety monitors conducted the interim analysis after the trial reached 75 percent of the 5,250 clinical events called for in the design of the study. The study is projected to finish in 2013, but Merck said the timeline may change depending on the rate of clinical events. Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said positive results would probably somewhat reignite sales of Vytorin and Zetia, and vindicate Merck, which was harshly criticized in the wake of the Enhance results. But Anderson doubted positive results would significantly boost Merck’s share price given Lipitor’s availability as a generic and competition from AstraZeneca’s  Crestor.",3282012,http://www.reuters.com/article/merck/update-1-merck-says-key-vytorin-study-cleared-to-continue-idUSL2E8ESHX320120328

190,MRK,GSK's new once-daily HIV drug matches Merck rival,"LONDON (Reuters) - A new once-daily AIDS drug from GlaxoSmithKline and its partner Shionogi proved just as good as Merck & Co’s twice-daily rival Isentress in a late-stage clinical trial, boosting hopes for the product. Both GSK’s new drug dolutegravir and Isentress are so-called integrase inhibitors, a novel class of drugs for fighting HIV/AIDS that block the virus causing the disease from entering cells. Dolutegravir is important for GSK since it could help rejuvenate its HIV/AIDS business - an area of medicine it used to dominate but where it has fallen behind rivals in recent years. GSK and Shionogi said on Monday that their experimental drug dolutegravir showed non-inferiority to Isentress, or raltegravir, when given for 48 weeks alongside two older types of HIV/AIDS medicines. In total, 88 percent of study participants on once-daily dolutegravir had their virus suppressed against 85 percent of those on twice-daily Isentress in the Phase III study. Tolerability was similar for both drugs. Merck’s drug, which had sales of $1.4 billion last year, is currently the only integrase inhibitor approved by regulators, although Gilead also has one in Phase III testing called elvitegravir. Dolutegravir belongs to ViiV Healthcare, a joint venture formed between GSK and Pfizer in 2009 in which GSK holds an 85 percent stake, and income from the medicine will be shared with Shionogi. The compound is viewed by analysts as a potential $1 billion-a-year seller, since the once-daily dosing is likely to be attractive to patients. However, the financial gain to GSK will be diluted by the sharing deals with Shionogi and Pfizer. Results of further Phase III trials are being awaited before GSK is ready to submit dolutegravir to regulators for approval. The experimental medicine is also being tested in Phase III in different groups of patients, including those who do not respond to Isentress, as well as in a combination product with GSK’s Epzicom, which consists of the HIV drugs Ziagen and Epivir. With results of these other Phase III clinical studies also due in 2012, dolutegravir could potentially be filed for approval with regulators before the end of this year, a company spokesman said.

193,MRK,Vaccines group gets cut-price rotavirus shots,"LONDON (Reuters) - International vaccines group GAVI has struck a deal for bulk buying rotavirus shots from GlaxoSmithKline and Merck which cuts the price by two-thirds and will allow poorer countries access to them at around $5 per course. The vaccines, GSK’s Rotarix and Merck’s Rotateq, combat the main cause of diarrhoea - the second-largest killer of children under the age of five worldwide. Because rotavirus-related diarrhoea kills more than 500,000 children a year, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended in 2009 that all countries should include rotavirus vaccines in national immunization programs, but many developing countries struggle to afford them. The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) said on Tuesday its cut-price deal would allow it “to respond to ever-increasing demand from developing countries” and provide the shots this year for 3 million children in eight poor countries. By 2016, GAVI said it planned to roll out the vaccines in more than 40 of the world’s poorest countries, immunizing more than 70 million children. Around 95 percent of the contracted supply of 132 million doses will be procured at a cost of $5 per two-dose course, GAVI said in a statement. This is a two-thirds price cut compared to the previous lowest price offered to GAVI of $15 a course. In the United States, the same vaccine course costs public institutions $177 and private health providers $213. GAVI is a Geneva-based public-private partnership backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the WHO, the World Bank, UNICEF, international donor governments and others. It funds bulk-buy immunization campaigns for poorer nations that can’t afford vaccines at rich-world prices. Its chief executive Seth Berkley said the deal showed how GAVI’s model was working to the benefit of some of the world’s most disadvantaged children. “We strive to make our donors’ funds go further so we can help developing countries protect more children against deadly diseases,” he said in a statement. The WHO says vaccination is one of the most cost-effective public health measures. It estimates that 2 to 3 million deaths are averted each year with immunization. GAVI had previously been struggling to get enough donor funding to sustain its programs, but it got a hefty boost last year when international donors led by Britain and the billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates pledged $4.3 billion to support it. A spokesman for GSK, which will supply 95 percent of the GAVI contracted doses, said the British drugmaker was glad to be contributing to efforts against preventable diseases. “Rotavirus vaccine has demonstrated real-world, life-saving impact on reducing deaths,” he said. “We have a chance here to collaborate in programs designed to protect millions of children.” ",4102012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-vaccines-gsk-merck-rotavirus/vaccines-group-gets-cut-price-rotavirus-shots-idUSBRE8380X920120410
194,MRK,Sexual side effects added to Merck drug labels,"(Reuters) - Prescribing labels for Merck & Co’s drugs for baldness and enlarged prostate will add reports of sexual side effects that continued after use of the medicines was stopped, U.S. health regulators said. Labels will be revised for Proscar, which treats symptoms of enlarged prostate, and hair-loss treatment Propecia, the Food and Drug Administration said. The active ingredient in both drugs is finasteride. The Propecia label will now include notification of problems with libido, ejaculation and orgasms that continued after use of the drug was ended. Proscar’s label will include notification of decreased libido. The labels of both drugs will also include a description of reports of male infertility and poor semen quality that normalized or improved after use of the drugs was stopped. In announcing the label changes, FDA cited events reported to the agency. “The cases suggest a broader range of adverse effects than previously reported in patients taking these drugs,” FDA said in a notification posted on its website. But it also said no clear causal links between finasteride and sexual adverse events had been established. FDA said sexual side effects were included in the labels of both drugs when they were approved in the 1990s. But in subsequent clinical trials, the side effects were resolved in patients who stopped using the drugs as well as in most patients who continued therapy, the agency said. Last year, the labels of both drugs were revised to include erectile dysfunction that continued after patients stopped using the drugs, the FDA said. Only a small percentage of men who use the drugs have experienced sexual side effects, the agency added. For example, it said, an analysis of clinical trials showed 3.8 percent of men taking Propecia reported one or more of the sexual side effects, compared with 2.1 percent of those who received a placebo. FDA said it believes that finasteride remains safe and effective for its approved uses and that patients on Proscar and Propecia should contact their doctors if they have concerns. In a statement, Merck said it believes both drugs are generally well tolerated and effective for their intended uses and that it supports efforts to ensure patient safety through monitoring of reported side effects. The drugs are relatively modest-sized products for the U.S. drugmaker. Merck reported $447 million in Propecia sales last year, and $223 million for Proscar. Merck shares were down 0.5 percent to $38.27 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

198,MRK,Endocyte soars on cancer drug deal with Merck,"(Reuters) - Endocyte Inc said Merck & Co Inc had acquired the development and marketing rights of its experimental cancer drug, the latest in the string of licensing deals by the No. 2 U.S. drugmaker to beef up its cancer drug pipeline. Shares of Endocyte, which had a market capitalization of about $136.18 million before the deal, more than doubled in value to $8.20 in early Monday trade. The stock was the biggest percentage gainer on the Nasdaq. Endocyte, which is responsible for a majority of the funding and completion of the ovarian cancer trial, will receive $120 million in cash and up to $880 million in milestone payments. “We also believe that this transaction definitely cracks the door open for an eventual acquisition by Merck, if they like what they see in the next couple of years ...,” Cowen and Co analyst Simos Simeonidis said in a note to clients. The upfront payment will also give Endocyte the ability to invest in their early-stage pipeline and a couple of years of cash, he added. Endocyte, which had $128.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at end-December, has three other drugs in early-stage development. The company will receive an equal share of profits in the United States, if the drug is approved. It will also get a double digit percentage royalty on sales of the product in the rest of the world. Merck, through a subsidiary, will gain worldwide rights to commercialize the drug vintafolide. Merck has four cancer drug candidates in mid-stage trials and one that is under review for approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In the last four months, it has acquired the rights to two cancer drugs from Threshold Pharmaceuticals and Exelixis Inc. Vintafolide is currently being tested in a late-stage trial for ovarian cancer and a mid-stage trial for non-small cell lung cancer. Endocyte had planned to file for marketing approval for Vintafolide in the third quarter of 2012. The drug received an orphan drug status in Europe last month. Endocyte’s shares were trading at $7.85 on Monday morning on the Nasdaq. Merck shares were slightly up at $38.03 on the New York Stock Exchange.

201,MRK,U.S.: do not mix Merck hepatitis pill with HIV drugs,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. drug regulators are changing the label for Merck & Co Inc’s recently approved Victrelis treatment for hepatitis C to show it should not be taken with some widely used HIV medicines. “Co-administration (of the two drugs) ... is not recommended at this time because of the possibility of reducing the effectiveness of the medicines, permitting the amount of HCV (hepatitis C virus) or HIV ... in the blood to increase,” the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Thursday. The FDA and Merck first warned about the issue in February based on the results of a drug interaction study, but a label change could further crimp sales of Victrelis. Victrelis, approved last May, attacks the hepatitis C virus that over time can lead to chronic liver disease or liver failure. Many patients with hepatitis are also infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which weakens the immune system and is fatal without treatment. The drug interaction study tested healthy volunteers who took Victrelis and the widely used HIV treatment Norvir (ritonavir) with one of three other anti-HIV pills. All of the HIV drugs work by blocking protease, an enzyme the virus needs in order to replicate. The study found Victrelis reduced the concentrations of the HIV drugs in the blood. Analysts have said the findings could crimp sales of Victrelis by as much as a quarter, since so many people are infected with both diseases. The FDA said it is changing the label for Victrelis also based on a small clinical trial presented last month that studied a total of 98 people. The trial results were not as conclusive as the drug interaction study. The trial tested people with both HIV and the hepatitis C virus, and gave some people Victrelis plus an older combination hepatitis C therapy, and others only the older combination treatment (peginterferon/ribavirin). All patients were given a type of anti-HIV pill. Out of the 64 people taking Victrelis, three had a rebound in their HIV, while four of the 34 people taking only the older combo drug had a rebound of the virus. Merck has said it still plans a larger drug-interaction trial of Victrelis with other HIV drugs.

205,MRK,"Merck profit beats forecast, revenue lags","(Reuters) - Merck & Co (MRK.N) reported quarterly earnings slightly above Wall Street forecasts, helped by cost controls, but revenue trailed expectations on generic competition and reduced proceeds from a joint venture with British drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L). The No. 2 U.S. drugmaker on Friday said global revenue rose 1 percent to $11.73 billion, compared with Wall Street expectations of $11.82 billion. Revenue would have risen 2 percent if not for the stronger dollar, which hurts the value of sales in overseas markets. Sales of the asthma treatment Singulair, whose U.S. patent lapses in August, edged 1 percent higher to $1.34 billion in the quarter. That marks a slowdown for Merck’s biggest product, whose sales jumped 8 percent in the prior quarter. Singulair could lose half or more of its sales soon after cheaper generics arrive. But the company has a lineup of promising medicines in clinical trials that it hopes will be approved, and help fill the revenue gap. They include a new type of insomnia treatment called suvorexant, osteoporosis treatment odanacatib and two drugs that have been delayed by regulators: Bridion, to reverse the effects of anesthesia, and Tredaptive, a form of niacin meant to raise “good” HDL cholesterol without causing facial flushing. “Beyond earnings, we continue to believe Merck’s late-stage pipeline updates in 2012 and 2013 represent key drivers for the stock,” JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott said in a research note, referring to expected progress reports on the drugs. Schott said Merck could generate compound annual earnings growth of 7 percent through 2017, the highest gains of any major drug company he covers. Even so, he said Merck shares are trading at only 10 times the company’s expected 2012 per-share earnings, a discount to most rival large drugmakers. Merck reported quarterly net income attributable to the company of $1.74 billion, or 56 cents per share. That compared with $1.04 billion, or 34 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, the company earned 99 cents a share. Analysts, on average, had expected 98 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Results were hurt by a 42 percent decline in revenue, to $186 million, from its longstanding alliance with AstraZeneca. Merck books some sales of AstraZeneca’s Nexium heartburn treatment, and manufactures some of the drug for AstraZeneca. But Merck’s proceeds from the joint venture fell during the quarter due to sharply lower sales of Nexium, and the timing of orders from AstraZeneca for the medicine. In a call with analysts, Merck officials said the company expects to remain in the venture at least through the first half of 2012. But they noted AstraZeneca has the right to buy out its stake and could exercise that option later this year. Sales of Merck’s Januvia diabetes medicine rose 24 percent to $919 million, while a related treatment called Janumet jumped 29 percent to $392 million. The Januvia diabetes franchise has become Merck’s biggest growth engine, and its biggest hope of offsetting looming declines of Singulair. HIV treatment Isentress, whose sales rose 15 percent to $337 million, slightly lagged analyst estimates, as did sales of arthritis treatment Remicade. Its sales plunged 31 percent to $519 million, following arbitration that assigned rival drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) a wider sales territory for the costly injectable drug. Merck acquired Remicade in 2009 through its acquisition of Schering Plough, which had sold it for years under an arrangement with J&J.; Cozaar, a blood pressure drug now facing generics, also dampened results, with sales falling 21 percent to $336 million. Sales of Gardasil, a vaccine to prevent cervical cancer, jumped 33 percent to $284 million, helped by its introduction in Japan and increased vaccination of males aged 9 through 26. With vaccinations, boys are less likely to become infected with the human papillomavirus and sexually transmit it to others. Animal health products were a bright spot in the earnings report, growing 8 percent to $821 million. Consumer healthcare products also stood out, growing 7 percent to $554 million. Merck reaffirmed it expects earnings for the full year, excluding special items, of $3.75 to $3.85 per share, comparable with last year’s profit of $3.77 per share.

206,MRK,"UPDATE 2-Merck profit beats forecast, revenue lags","* Q1 EPS, excluding items, $0.99 vs forecast of $0.98 * Q1 sales rise 1 pct to $11.73 billion vs $11.82 bln view * Reaffirms 2012 profit forecast * Shares dip 0.1 pct By Ransdell Pierson April 27 (Reuters) - Merck & Co reported quarterly earnings slightly above Wall Street forecasts, helped by cost controls, but revenue trailed expectations on generic competition and reduced proceeds  from a joint venture with British drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc. The No. 2 U.S. drugmaker on Friday said global revenue rose 1 percent to $11.73 billion, compared with Wall Street expectations of $11.82 billion. Revenue would have risen 2 percent if not for the stronger dollar, which hurts the value of sales in overseas markets. Sales of the asthma treatment Singulair, whose U.S. patent lapses in August, edged 1 percent higher to $1.34 billion in the quarter. That marks a slowdown for Merck’s biggest product, whose sales jumped 8 percent in the prior quarter. Singulair could lose half or more of its sales soon after cheaper generics arrive. But the company has a lineup of promising medicines in clinical trials that it hopes will be approved, and help fill the revenue gap. They include a new type of insomnia treatment called suvorexant, osteoporosis treatment odanacatib and two drugs that have been delayed by regulators: Bridion, to reverse the effects of anesthesia, and Tredaptive, a form of niacin meant to raise “good” HDL cholesterol without causing facial flushing. “Beyond earnings, we continue to believe Merck’s late-stage pipeline updates in 2012 and 2013 represent key drivers for the stock,” JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott said in a research note, referring to expected progress reports on the drugs. Schott said Merck could generate compound annual earnings growth of 7 percent through 2017, the highest gains of any major drug company he covers. Even so, he said Merck shares are trading at only 10 times the company’s expected 2012 per-share earnings, a discount to most rival large drugmakers. Merck reported quarterly net income attributable to the company of $1.74 billion, or 56 cents per share. That compared with $1.04 billion, or 34 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, the company earned 99 cents a  share. Analysts, on average, had expected 98 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Results were hurt by a 42 percent decline in revenue, to $186 million, from its longstanding alliance with AstraZeneca. Merck books some sales of AstraZeneca’s Nexium heartburn treatment, and manufactures some of the drug for AstraZeneca. But Merck’s proceeds from the joint venture fell during the quarter due to sharply lower sales of Nexium, and the timing of orders from AstraZeneca for the medicine. In a call with analysts, Merck officials said the company expects to remain in the venture at least through the first half of 2012. But they noted AstraZeneca has the right to buy out its stake and could exercise that option later this year. Sales of Merck’s Januvia diabetes medicine rose 24 percent to $919 million, while a related treatment called Janumet jumped 29 percent to $392 million. The Januvia diabetes franchise has become Merck’s biggest growth engine, and its biggest hope of offsetting looming declines of Singulair. HIV treatment Isentress, whose sales rose 15 percent to $337 million, slightly lagged analyst estimates, as did sales of arthritis treatment Remicade. Its sales plunged 31 percent to $519 million, following arbitration that assigned rival drugmaker Johnson & Johnson a wider sales territory for the costly injectable drug. Merck acquired Remicade in 2009 through its acquisition of Schering Plough, which had sold it for years under an arrangement with J&J.; Cozaar, a blood pressure drug now facing generics, also dampened results, with sales falling 21 percent to $336 million. Sales of Gardasil, a vaccine to prevent cervical cancer,  jumped 33 percent to $284 million, helped by its introduction in Japan and increased vaccination of males aged 9 through 26. With vaccinations, boys are less likely to become infected with the  human papillomavirus and sexually transmit it to others. Animal health products were a bright spot in the earnings report, growing 8 percent to $821 million. Consumer healthcare products also stood out, growing 7 percent to $554 million. Merck reaffirmed it expects earnings for the full year, excluding special items, of $3.75 to $3.85 per share, comparable with last year’s profit of $3.77 per share. Company shares were down 0.1 percent at $38.42 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

211,MRK,UPDATE 2-US FDA rejects Merck/Ariad sarcoma drug,"* Panel voted 13-1 against Taltorvic in March * Drug meant to keep sarcoma from getting worse * Ariad shares down 2.4 pct in aftermarket WASHINGTON, June 5 (Reuters) - U.S. drugs regulators rejected an experimental sarcoma medicine from Merck and Ariad Pharmaceuticals on Tuesday, asking for more clinical trials, Merck said. The Food and Drug Administration issued a so-called “complete response letter” for the injectable therapy, known generically as ridaforolimus, after an advisory panel recommended against approval earlier this year. The drug, which would have been sold as Taltorvic, is meant as a maintenance treatment for soft-tissue and bone sarcoma - or tumors arising from the connective tissue - for people who have already had at least four successful rounds of chemotherapy. Soft-tissue sarcoma is a rare but aggressive form of cancer that afflicted about 11,000 Americans last year and killed about 4,000 of them, according to the National Cancer Institute. An advisory panel of outside experts to the FDA recommended rejecting the medicine in March by a vote of 13 to 1 after data linked the drug with serious side effects like hospitalization or death, but showed it produced only small improvements in the amount of time before cancer worsened. Merck, which licensed all development and marketing rights to the drug from Ariad, said it would work with the FDA to figure out next steps. “Merck remains confident in the potential of ridaforolimus,” Dr. Eric Rubin, the company’s vice president for clinical research oncology, said in a statement. Merck said it is still working on getting approval in Europe, and is testing the drug in other cancers, including lung, breast, endometrial and ovarian cancer. Shares of Merck briefly slipped 0.6 percent to $37.27 in after-market trading before recovering, while shares of Ariad, a smaller company, fell 2.4 percent to $15.81. Although Ariad’s shares also fell after the panel vote in March, some analysts said the medicine is of relatively minor importance for the small biotech, which has two more major drugs in the pipeline and would only get royalties from an approval of Taltorvic.",6052012,http://www.reuters.com/article/merck-results/update-2-us-fda-rejects-merck-ariad-sarcoma-drug-idUSL3E8H5AQM20120605
212,MRK,Merck sleep drug hits most goals of pivotal trials,"(Reuters) - An experimental Merck & Co insomnia drug significantly reduced the time it took patients to fall asleep and helped them stay asleep longer, according to data from a pair of pivotal late-stage studies. Suvorexant, in a new class of medicines, proved to be significantly better than placebo, meeting all but one of the goals in one of the two Phase III trials with about 1,000 patients in each. Based on the data from these and other trials, Merck said it expects to file for approval of the drug later this year. Unlike sleep drugs that are typically taken as needed, suvorexant is designed to be taken nightly over long periods of time. A new type of medicine, suvorexant works by blocking chemical messengers called orexins that help to keep you awake. Blocking orexins, which originate from the hypothalamus in the brain, helps facilitate sleep. “The potential for a new and different option would be welcomed by patients with insomnia who cannot sleep through the night,” Andrew Krystal, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University Medical Center, said in a statement. Darryle Schoepp, head of neuroscience and ophthalmology for Merck, said suvorexant appears to be well suited for patients who are not getting a full night sleep from existing drugs, including the long-acting version of Sanofi’s Ambien. “Ambien CR only keeps you asleep five to six hours,” he said in an interview. “We’ve shown our drug keeps you asleep the last third of the night as well.” Patients in the three-month studies were suffering from insomnia not caused by another medical condition. One study tested the drug at 40 milligrams in patients 18-64 years of age and 30 mg in those 65 and older. The second study tested suvorexant at 20 mg in the younger group and 15 mg in patients 65 and older. The data was being presented on Wednesday at the Annual Meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies in Boston. In the high dose trial, at three months suvorexant reduced the time it took to fall asleep by 25.7 minutes and helped patients sleep 60.3 minutes longer than prior to starting on the medicine. That compared with a time to sleep reduction of 17.3 minutes and 40.6 minutes more sleep on placebo. Suvorexant patients entered into continuous sleep 36 minutes faster compared with 26.6 minutes faster in the placebo group, and spent less time awake during the night — 47.9 minutes less versus 25 minutes less for placebo compared with prior to beginning the study. In the low dose trial, suvorexant proved to be significantly better than placebo on all measures save for difference in time to fall into continuous sleep at three months, which did not achieve statistical significance. In that study, the Merck drug reduced the time it took to fall asleep by 33.7 minutes versus 20.5 minutes in the placebo group. It helped them to sleep an average of 62.8 minutes longer, while a placebo led to 37.7 minutes more sleep. Low dose suvorexant patients spent 54.2 fewer minutes awake during the night than before they started taking the drug, compared with 24.8 minutes for the placebo group. In addition to the three-month data, suvorexant was superior to a placebo after the first night and after one month of treatment, Merck said. The most common side effects from the Merck drug was headache and sleepiness. No serious drug related side effects were reported, Merck said. Discontinuation rates due to side effects were small and similar between the drug and placebo groups. There were also no statistically significant next day residual effects compared with placebo as measured by an assessment of memory, attention, visual scanning and motor speed, Merck said.

214,MRK,UPDATE 1-Merck loses Nasonex patent case,"* Had filed suit against Apotex plan for generic Nasonex * Merck says likely to appeal By Nate Raymond June 15 (Reuters) - Merck & Co, Inc lost a patent infringement lawsuit against Apotex Inc on Friday over Apotex’s plans to market a generic version of the nasal allergy spray Nasonex. U.S. District Judge Peter Sheridan in Trenton, New Jersey,  dismissed Merck’s complaint for patent infringement after finding it had failed to present sufficient evidence during a trial in April. The judge separately dismissed Apotex’s counterclaim that Merck’s patent was invalid. “Today’s decision reflects just one step in the lengthy patent litigation process, and we plan to review all of our options, including a likely appeal of the decision,” Bruce Kuhlik, general counsel of Merck, said in a statement. Elie Betito, a representative for Apotex, had no immediate comment. Merck’s Schering-Plough unit filed the lawsuit in December 2009 after the Apotex, a privately-held company in Canada, sought U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to market a generic version of Nasonex. The application sought to allow Apotex to market the generic version prior to the expiration of the patent at issue in the lawsuit, which is set to expire in April 2018. The FDA has yet to approve the application. A bench trial was held April 2012. At trial, Apotex contended its nasal spray was different from Nasonex as the company intended to manufacture a version that did not contain water, unlike Merck’s. Merck had warned in its most recent quarterly report that an unfavorable decision in the Apotex case “would result in significant loss of sales in the U.S. market if generic versions become available.” Global sales of Nasonex were $1.3 billion in 2011 and $375 million in the first quarter of 2012. Nasonex had U.S. sales of $161 million in the first quarter, according to the company’s May 8 quarterly report.",6152012,http://www.reuters.com/article/merck-apotex/update-1-merck-loses-nasonex-patent-case-idUSL1E8HFI0X20120615

220,MRK,"UPDATE 1-Merck, Astra keep drug alliance for two more years","June 27 (Reuters) - Merck & Co will keep booking sales and profits for two more years tied to AstraZeneca Plc’s  widely used acid reflux medicines Nexium and Prilosec under an amended agreement between the two large drugmakers. Merck previously assumed it would record contributions from the longstanding partnership only through September this year. Now the alliance will last until 2014, when AstraZeneca will have the option of buying Merck’s interest in the partnership. The continuation of the partnership is expected to add about $200 million to Merck’s revenue and 3 cents to 5 cents in earnings per share in 2012, but does not change the U.S. firm’s full-year profit guidance, Merck said on Wednesday. The revised deal will help shore up Merck’s financial performance through the U.S. patent expiration later this year of its big-selling Singulair allergy and asthma drug, although the benefits will dwindle as sales of Nexium decline. The partnership agreement dates back to a selling and distribution joint venture originally set up between Merck and Sweden’s Astra in 1982. Astra later merged with Britain’s Zeneca to form AstraZeneca. Under the amended deal, the two partners have agreed an option price of $327 million payable to Merck in 2014, plus an amount equal to 10 times Merck’s average 1 percent annual profit allocation in the partnership, expected to be some $80 million. The price paid by AstraZeneca could also include the net present value of up to 5 percent of future U.S. sales of painkiller Vimovo. ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said buying out Merck this year would probably have cost AstraZeneca around $800 million and delaying until 2014 would likely reduce the amount to about $450 million.",6272012,http://www.reuters.com/article/merck-astrazeneca/update-1-merck-astra-keep-drug-alliance-for-two-more-years-idUSL2E8HR28820120627

223,MRK,"UPDATE 1-Merck bone drug shows clear benefits, trial halted","* Regulatory filings planned for first-half 2013 * Merck shares rise 3.1 percent in after-hours trade July 11 (Reuters) - A pivotal trial of Merck & Co’s  experimental osteoporosis drug odanacatib has shown that it reduces fracture risk, prompting outside monitors to recommend that the study be stopped early so that all patients in the trial can be offered the treatment. The Data Monitoring Committee also said safety issues “in certain selected areas,” need to be followed, Merck said in a statement on Wednesday. Shares of Merck rose more than 3 percent in after-hours trading to $42.49. Earlier, the stock closed at $41.21 on the New York Stock Exchange. The company said it expects to submit regulatory applications for U.S., European and Japanese approval of odanacatib in the first half of next year. The oral drug, taken weekly, is considered more convenient than the class of osteoporosis drugs known as bisphosphonates. Sales of Merck’s bisphosphonate drug Fosamax reached $3 billion in 2007, but that revenue has plunged since emergence of generic competition in early 2008. Bisphosphonate use has also declined due to safety concerns including the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw, a severe bone disease. Wall Street analysts, on average, have forecast annual sales of odanacatib at $402 million by 2016, according to Thomson Pharma. The drug is designed to block cathepsin K, the major enzyme in osteoclasts that is responsible for breakdown of existing bone tissue. The pivotal study involved over 16,000 post-menopausal women with osteoporosis. It was expected to continue until hip fractures had been reported in 237 patients. Merck said the interim analysis was conducted when around 70 percent of the targeted number of hip fractures had been reported.

225,MRK,"Merck osteoporosis drug, company pipeline win more respect","(Reuters) - Industry analysts on Thursday predicted annual sales of up to $3 billion for a Merck osteoporosis drug shown to be effective before its clinical trial was completed, and said the development could provide a needed jolt of faith in Merck’s overall drugs pipeline. Merck, the second-biggest U.S. drugmaker, on Wednesday said outside monitors recommended that its late-stage study of odanacatib, a new type of treatment, be stopped early because data has already shown it reduces fractures. Shares of Merck rose 4.2 percent on Thursday, on boosted hopes for the medicine. Merck needs approvals of odanacatib and other medicines to help offset expected plunging sales of its flagship product, the $6 billion-a-year asthma treatment Singulair. Within months, Singulair will begin facing competition from cheaper generics in the United States. Deutsche Bank analyst Barbara Ryan said odanacatib and four other drugs that Merck is expected to submit for regulatory approval by next year have “multibillion dollar sales potential.” “The market has not given the company credit for a pipeline,” Ryan said. “Therefore this result is a definitive and psychological positive.” Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez, who had predicted peak annual sales of $975 million for odanacatib in 2020, said sales could reach $3 billion if final data from the study confirms it can safely reduce fracture risk by more than 40 percent. Standard current treatments for osteoporosis, Merck’s own Fosamax and Actonel from Warner Chilcott, belong to a family of medicines called bisphosphonates that can reduce bone fractures by 35 to 40 percent. But they have been associated with a range of side effects, including stomach and muscle pain, as well as relatively rare thigh bone fractures and jaw decay. “Odanacatib’s excellent tolerability profile would make it the drug of choice in the 20 to 30 percent of patients intolerant to bisphosphonates,” Fernandez said in a research report. Other medicines winding their way through late-stage trials at Merck have seen mixed results. In February, hopes wilted for the most important of Merck’s experimental medicines, a blood clot preventer called vorapaxar, when it was associated with excessive bleeding in one of the biggest heart trials ever conducted. Once heralded as a potential $3 billion-a-year drug, Wall Street has essentially written off the medicine. Merck had acquired vorapaxar, which prevents blood clots through a new mechanism of action, in its 2009 purchase of rival drugmaker Schering-Plough, and it had been considered the crown jewel of Schering-Plough’s own pipeline. Confidence in Merck perked up a bit in June, when the company said its experimental insomnia drug suvorexant maintained effectiveness for 12 months in a late-stage study. It was the first sleep aid ever tested for a full year, and Merck reaffirmed it plans this year to seek marketing approval for the medicine. Merck also plans this year to seek approval for Bridion, a medicine to reverse the effects of anesthesia that has been held up for several years by regulatory concerns. Bridion also came from Schering-Plough. Next year, it plans to seek approval for Tredaptive, a drug to boost “good” HDL cholesterol that has also faced long regulatory delays because of safety concerns. In clinical trials, Tredaptive raised HDL levels by 20 percent, while cutting “bad” LDL cholesterol by 18 percent.

The Dow briefly moved into positive territory in sync with Procter & Gamble’s advance, with the blue-chip average bouncing off technical support at 12,500, analysts said. The S&P; 500  earlier traded below its 50-day moving average at 1,334. “We tested (1,334) and bounced, but the flavor of the market is still somewhat tenuous, given the testing of these technical support levels and also the strength in the 10-year bond,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president of BB&T; Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was up 11/32 in price, with the yield at 1.482 percent. The Dow pared most of its loss, getting a lift from the shares of Procter & Gamble - up 4.6 percent at $64.22 -  after a source said activist investor William Ackman appears to be building a stake in the U.S. household products company.  Merck & Co. shares also bolstered the Dow. Merck’s stock rose 4.1 percent to $42.91 after a pivotal trial of Merck’s experimental osteoporosis drug odanacatib has shown that it reduces the risk of fracture. But overall, market sentiment was weak, especially after the lack of any monetary easing by the Bank of Japan on Thursday, and few clues in the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s June policy meeting, released on Wednesday. The lack of policy moves suggested major central banks were still cautious about the need for further easing. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 5.56 points, or 0.04 percent, at 12,598.97.

228,MRK,Strong Merck results boost faith as generics loom,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings on strong sales of vaccines and treatments for diabetes and HIV, giving investors greater faith the company can weather looming generic competition for its flagship Singulair asthma drug. The No. 2 U.S. drugmaker, whose shares were up 3.4 percent after touching a 52-week high, on Friday also attributed the second-quarter profit beat to a $260 million decline in marketing and administrative expenses. The company is girding for the U.S. patent expiration next month on its biggest product, $5 billion-a-year Singulair, which will open the floodgates to cheaper generics. Analysts expect the pill to swiftly lose as much as two-thirds of its sales and hurt Merck’s results for the rest of the year and well into 2013. Adding to the pain, the company’s Maxalt migraine drug, with $600 million in annual sales, goes generic in December, followed by generic competition next year for its Temodar brain cancer medicine, which has near-blockbuster sales of $900 million. Merck is counting on its respected pipeline of experimental drugs to come through and help offset the vanishing Singulair sales. Over the next 18 months, it aims to seek six drug approvals, including marketing applications for new types of therapies for insomnia and osteoporosis. ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said quarterly results were “very good,” driven by surprisingly strong sales. “But this really isn’t an earnings story, (but) more of an emerging pipeline story against the backdrop of low investor expectations,” he wrote in a research note. Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said the coming wave of new Merck drugs should spark the beginnings of a profit rebound in 2014, just as diabetes drug Januvia and other new medicines allowed Merck to bounce back from earlier patent expirations on big drugs like its Zocor cholesterol fighter and Fosamax osteoporosis treatment. “Previous rebounds remind folks that Merck has a very innovative pipeline and the ability to bring new products to market,” Conover said. “And its resiliency will allow it to get through the Singulair patent cliff.” Merck’s research spending rose 12 percent in the quarter, to $2.17 billion, as it completes costly late-stage trials of new drugs. Company Chief Executive Kenneth Frazier, in a conference call with analysts, said the company has significantly trimmed its research budget since 2009, but is willing to boost spending when warranted. “At the end of the day, research and development spending should be a function ... of specific products we have in the pipeline,” he said. Merck said it had earned $1.79 billion, or 58 cents per share, in the second quarter, compared with $2.02 billion, or 65 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, the company earned $1.05 per share. Analysts on average expected $1.01. Sales rose 1 percent to $12.31 billion, topping estimates of $12.15 billion. They would have risen 5 percent if not for the stronger dollar, which lowers the value of sales in overseas markets. Despite the negative impact of foreign exchange, Merck affirmed its full-year earnings forecast of $3.75 to $3.85 per share, excluding special items. That compares with last year’s profit of $3.77. Singulair sales rose 6 percent in the quarter to $1.43 billion. Sales of Januvia, Merck’s fastest-growing product in the past few years, soared 36 percent to $1.06 billion, while a related treatment called Janumet rose 28 percent to $411 million. Sales of HIV treatment Isentress rose 18 percent to $398 million. But sales of blood pressure treatment Cozaar, which recently lost patent protection, tumbled 17 percent to $337 million. Merck shares were up 3.4 percent at $44.79 on Friday morning, after touching a 52-week high of $44.95 earlier in the session. The shares have risen 27 percent in the past year, helped by layoffs and cost cuts following Merck’s acquisition in late 2009 of U.S. rival Schering-Plough. During the past year, the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index .DRG of large U.S. and European drugmakers has risen 10 percent.

The drugmakers, whose cheaper versions of Singulair are expected to quickly steal two thirds of the branded product’s sales, include Mylan Inc, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and the Sandoz division of Novartis AG. Singulair, unlike most allergy drugs which block the protein histamine, instead blocks proteins called leukotrienes that cause inflammation.

234,MRK,Key data on Merck cholesterol drug pushed to 2014,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc said on Wednesday it expects data from a large study designed to assess the effectiveness of its cholesterol drug Vytorin to be available in 2014, instead of 2013. The closely watched, 18,000-patient trial, called IMPROVE- IT, was designed to assess whether Merck’s drug Zetia, when combined with its older cholesterol drug Zocor, is more effective in reducing heart attacks and strokes than Zocor alone. Zocor, known also as simvastatin, is a statin similar to Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor. Zetia cuts cholesterol using a different method. The study aims to show that Zetia confers an additional benefit over Zocor alone. Merck’s drug Vytorin combines Zetia and Zocor in a single pill and is the product being used in the trial. Zetia and Vytorin are among Merck’s biggest-selling products, generating combined sales last year of $4.3 billion. Doubts about their effectiveness in cutting heart attacks has slowed growth. The hope among investors is that positive results from IMPROVE-IT will reinvigorate those sales. Questions about the combination treatment arose after data from a previous trial known as ENHANCE found that Vytorin was no more effective in reducing plaque in the carotid artery than Zocor alone and did not answer the question of whether the addition of Zetia further cut the rate of heart attacks. And while Vytorin did a better job of reducing “bad” LDL cholesterol, it did not bring about significant changes in other key measures in patients with a hereditary form of high cholesterol known as familial hypercholesterolemia. The IMPROVE-IT trial is scheduled to end once 5,250 clinical events, such as heart attacks and strokes, have been reported. In March of this year, the trial’s independent Data Safety Monitoring Board completed a second interim efficacy analysis and recommended no change to the study design. It said it planned to review the data again in approximately nine months. Merck said that review has now been scheduled for March 2013. Based on the current rate at which events are being reported, the company said it anticipates the targeted number of events will be reached in 2014. Merck’s shares were up 0.14 percent at $44.06 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

The pharmaceutical company said in a statement that it is in discussions with regulatory agencies over vorapaxar, a drug that has been dogged by bleeding concerns since January 2011, when a safety committee overseeing a large study said the new type of anti-platelet drug was not appropriate for patients who had suffered a stroke. It plans to file the application with regulators in the United States and Europe in 2013. Merck said it will “seek an indication for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with a history of heart attack” and no history of stroke. Merck obtained vorapaxar through its $41 billion acquisition of rival Schering Plough in late 2009. At the time, it was considered to be the crown jewel of Schering Plough’s drug pipeline.

243,MRK,Merck agrees to settle Coppertone class action suit,"Sept 25 (Reuters) - Merck & Co has agreed to pay between $3 million and $10 million to settle a nearly decade old class-action lawsuit that alleged the company made false claims about the benefits of its  Coppertone sunscreen products. Merck acquired the popular Coppertone franchise in 2009 when it bought U.S. rival Schering-Plough Corp, and thereby inherited the 2003 lawsuit. Merck denied any wrongdoing or liability or that anyone was harmed by the allegedly exaggerated claims for Coppertone sprays and lotions cited in the lawsuit, which was filed on behalf of numerous consumers. It agreed to the settlement “solely for the purpose of avoiding the burden, expense, risk and uncertainty of continuing to litigate those issues,” the company said in the settlement agreement filed last Friday in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. Merck agreed that all Coppertone sunscreen products manufactured on or after June 22, 2012 for sale in the United States, its territories and possessions, will not use the terms “sunblock,” “waterproof,” “sweatproof,” “all day” and/or “all day protection” in the label, advertising, marketing or promotion of the products. Once the settlement becomes final, members of the class who bought the Coppertone products at issue will be able to submit a claim worth up to $1.50 for each eligible sunscreen product purchased. Merck spokesman Ron Rogers said all Coppertone products meet the latest standards for broad-spectrum sun protection set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and added they carry product information consistent with the FDA standards.

244,MRK,Cardiome says Merck pulls out of heart drug deal,"(Reuters) - Cardiome Pharma Corp said its partner Merck & Co returned the global marketing and development rights for both versions of their heart drug, six months after dropping development of the oral version. “The market has been waiting for some clarity as to where this franchise is going and we thank Merck for providing that clarity,” William Hunter, interim CEO of Cardiome, said on a conference call. Cardiome shares rose 22 percent to 44 Canadian cents on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The stock, which has lost nearly 86 percent of its value this year through Tuesday close, was one of the top percentage gainers on the exchange. Cardiome’s U.S.-listed shares rose as much as 22 percent to 45 cents on the Nasdaq on Wednesday. The drug, Vernakalant, is an experimental treatment for chronic atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm disorder that can lead to stroke and heart failure. Merck in March dropped the development of an oral version of the drug due to regulatory issues and expected development timeline, forcing Cardiome to cut about 85 percent of its workforce. “We will take a long hard look at what can be done to reinitiate momentum on the intravenous program in the U.S. ... or what the next step should be on the oral program,” the company said. The intravenous version of the drug is not approved in the United States or Canada, Cardiome said in a statement. Cardiome, which had cash and cash equivalents of $60.7 million at June 30, said it may be beyond its financial capabilities to do that alone. Vancouver-based Cardiome also develops drugs for the circulatory system.

The Ghent-based biotechnology company, which listed on Euronext Brussels in November 2007, said that upon signing of the agreement it would receive a 6.5 million euro initial payment and a 2 million euro fee for research funding. Merck, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, will gain exclusive rights to nanobodies directed towards a voltage-gated ion channel with the option to develop a nanobody to a second target. Disruption of ion channels, which regulate the flow of ions across the membranes of cells, are involved in a wide range of conditions including neurological disorders, hypertension, diabetes, cancer and arrhythmia. In 2011, sales of the top 20 best-selling ion channel drugs amounted to nearly $14 billion, but there are no approved antibody-based drugs that target ion channels, Ablynx said in a statement. The protein fragments, or nanobodies, made by Ablynx scientists are one-tenth the size of normal antibodies, which means they may reach new targets in the body and could potentially be administered orally rather than by injection. Ablynx already has partnerships with Merck Serono, Boehringer Ingelheim, Novartis NOVX.VN and Pfizer (PFE.N).

247,MRK,Merck's once-a-week diabetes drug effective in clinical study,"(Reuters) - An experimental once-a-week drug for type 2 diabetes being developed by Merck & Co proved effective in lowering blood sugar levels in a mid-stage clinical trial, according to data presented on Wednesday. The pill, known as MK-3102, is from the same class of medicines as Merck’s successful daily diabetes drug Januvia, known as DPP-4 inhibitors. The 685-patient study tested MK-3102 at five doses - ranging from 0.25 milligram to 25 mg - against a placebo, with the primary goal being reduction in A1c, a common measure of blood sugar. After 12 weeks of treatment with the Merck drug, A1c was reduced 0.71 percent at 25 mg, 0.67 percent at 10 mg, 0.49 percent at 3 mg, 0.5 percent with 1 mg, and 0.28 percent for the lowest 0.25 mg dose. The reductions compared with placebo for all doses were deemed to be statistically significant, according to Merck, which presented the data on Wednesday at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) meeting in Berlin. Based on the encouraging Phase II results, Merck said it is beginning larger Phase III trials of the drug — typically the final stage of human testing before seeking regulatory approval. The company said it has chosen to advance only the 25 mg dose for a Phase III program that will test MK-3102 against, and in combination with, a variety of diabetes treatments. The 0.71 reduction seen with the 25 mg dose in the study is similar to the glucose reduction attained by Januvia, known chemically as sitagliptin. Januvia has been a bright spot for Merck. It and a related combination diabetes pill called Janumet saw sales jump to $1.47 billion in the second quarter, putting the franchise on track for nearly $6 billion in sales this year. “We do anticipate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of this will be comparable to sitagliptin,” Nancy Thornberry, Merck’s head of diabetes and endocrinology, said in a telephone interview from Berlin. “We have almost six years of marketed use with sitagliptin, and so the safety and tolerability of the class as a whole has been extremely well established, as has the efficacy profile,” Thornberry said. However, she stressed that MK-3102 was a new compound and not simply a new formulation of Januvia. As with all new diabetes treatments since GlaxoSmithKine’s Avandia was linked to serious heart risks, Merck will be expected to demonstrate the heart safety of MK-3102 in its Phase III trials. Patients in the Phase II study began the trial with an A1c level of about 8 percent. American Diabetes Association guidelines call for A1c levels of 7 percent or lower. The drug was generally well tolerated with a safety profile similar to placebo, Merck said. As with Januvia, the new drug is likely to work by itself or in combination with other diabetes treatments, including insulin, Merck said. “We think this is going to be a very attractive choice for patients who have a high pill burden. Any attempt to simplify the regimen for those patients is helpful,” Thornberry said.

248,MRK,Merck's once-a-week diabetes drug effective in clinical study,"* MK-3102 lowers blood glucose 0.71 pct at 25 mg in study * Safety seen similar to placebo in Phase II trial * Merck says begins Phase III MK-3102 program with 25 mg dose Oct 3 (Reuters) - An experimental once-a-week drug for type 2 diabetes being developed by Merck & Co proved effective in lowering blood sugar levels in a mid-stage clinical trial, according to data presented on Wednesday. The pill, known as MK-3102, is from the same class of medicines as Merck’s successful daily diabetes drug Januvia, known as DPP-4 inhibitors. The 685-patient study tested MK-3102 at five doses - ranging from 0.25 milligram to 25 mg - against a placebo, with the primary goal being reduction in A1c, a common measure of blood sugar. After 12 weeks of treatment with the Merck drug, A1c was reduced 0.71 percent at 25 mg, 0.67 percent at 10 mg, 0.49 percent at 3 mg, 0.5 percent with 1 mg, and 0.28 percent for the lowest 0.25 mg dose. The reductions compared with placebo for all doses were deemed to be statistically significant, according to Merck, which presented the data on Wednesday at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) meeting in Berlin. Based on the encouraging Phase II results, Merck said it is beginning larger Phase III trials of the drug — typically the final stage of human testing before seeking regulatory approval.

252,MRK,Merck osteoporosis drug builds bone density in mid-stage trial,"Oct 13 (Reuters) - Hip and spine bone mineral density increased significantly among post-menopausal women on Merck & Co’s experimental new osteoporosis drug who had previously taken a standard older company treatment, the drugmaker said on Saturday. The favorable results were seen in a mid-stage trial of Merck’s odanacatib, a once-weekly pill which works by blocking an enzyme called cat-K found within bone cells. The enzyme plays a key role in the body’s natural process of dissolving bone tissue. The study involved 243 women with osteoporosis who had previously been treated for at least three years with alendronate, the chemical name of Merck’s Fosamax drug. It belongs to an older class of medicines called bisphosphonates whose sales have been hurt by rare reports of leg fractures and deterioration of jaw bone in patients taking them. “Odanacatib may be a viable alternative for patients who need continued therapy and who want benefits beyond what they received from bisphosphonates,” senior Merck research executive Albert Leung said in an interview, referring to favorable data from the new trial. Patients were given 50-milligram weekly doses of odanacatib, or a placebo, for 24 months. All patients also received vitamin D3 and calcium supplements, if needed. At the end of the study, bone mineral density was shown to increase by a statistically significant degree at three pre-specified hip sites, including a 0.83 percent increase for the total hip. That compared with a 1.87 percent decline in bone mineral density for the total hip among patients receiving placebos. Bone mineral density increased by 2.28 percent at the lumbar spine among those taking odanacatib, compared with a 0.3 percent decrease for patients on placebos. There was no difference between the odanacatib and placebo groups in changes of bone mineral density in the forearm. The overall incidence of side effects were similar between the two treatment groups.",10132012,http://www.reuters.com/article/merck-osteoporosis/merck-osteoporosis-drug-builds-bone-density-in-mid-stage-trial-idUSL1E8LCHVY20121013
253,MRK,"Tax gains lift Merck profits, but sales disappoint","(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit as one-time tax gains helped offset plunging sales of its former flagship product, Singulair, an asthma drug that began facing cheaper generics in August. But overall third-quarter sales came in slightly below Wall Street expectations on Friday, as Singulair’s decline outpaced already-grim predictions for it. “There was nothing excellent about the quarter, but nothing scary about it either,” said Michael Liss, portfolio manager of American Century Investments, whose mutual funds own Merck shares. Sales of Singulair tumbled 55 percent to $602 million. However, a number of Merck’s newer products - including treatments for diabetes, hepatitis C and HIV - generated double-digit sales gains that helped cushion Singulair’s free fall. All told, global company revenue fell 4 percent to $11.49 billion in the quarter, below Wall Street expectations of $11.57 billion. Liss said the slim decline was acceptable, given the Singulair generics, especially in view of potential new revenue streams from medicines Merck is shepherding through clinical trials. “They’re doing the right things they need to do to position themselves for growth over the next three to five years,” Liss said, citing experimental drugs to treat cholesterol, Alzheimer’s disease, insomnia, osteoporosis and other diseases. Merck needs the new drugs to cushion Singulair’s swoon, but also to withstand looming generic competition for other important medicines. Its Maxalt migraine drug, with $600 million in annual sales, goes generic in December, followed next year by its Temodar brain cancer medicine, which has near-blockbuster sales of $900 million. Over the next 18 months, Merck aims to seek six drug approvals, including marketing applications for insomnia treatment suvorexant and osteoporosis treatment odanacatib. In a conference call with analysts, Merck officials described plans within months to begin a late-stage trial of a new psoriasis drug and mid-stage trials of an Alzheimer’s disease treatment - called a beta secretase inhibitor. The psoriasis drug, called MK-3222, works by blocking a protein called IL-17 linked to inflammation. “Psoriasis is a great market because of the unmet medical need and if this drug is effective it could easily be a blockbuster product,” with annual sales of $1 billion or more, said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover. Amgen Inc’s Enbrel is the best-selling current treatment for psoriasis, with expected 2012 U.S. sales for the skin condition of $1.18 billion, according to Cowen and Co. Merck, the No. 2 U.S. drugmaker, said it earned $1.73 billion, or 56 cents per share, compared with $1.69 billion, or 55 cents per share, in the year-earlier quarter.

261,MRK,"Merck becomes bigger Alzheimer's player, with new trial","(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc has moved to the forefront of Alzheimer’s disease research by starting a mid-stage study of a drug from a new class of oral medicines that aim to shut down production of a protein associated with the memory-robbing disease. The drugmaker said on Monday it had started the trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of its so-called BACE inhibitor, named MK-8931, in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease. The Phase II trial, which will compare the drug with a placebo, is a global, multi-center study that includes a group of 200 patients to test safety. The study is expected eventually to enroll up to 1,700 patients in the main Phase III trial. Darryle Schoepp, head of neuroscience at Merck, said drugmakers have been trying for a decade to develop treatments that arrest Alzheimer’s disease by blocking beta secretase, an enzyme involved in production of toxic beta amyloid proteins that form plaque in the brain believed to be a contributor to Alzheimer’s disease. By blocking beta secretase in earlier Phase I trials, the Merck drug slashed by more than 90 percent the levels of beta amyloid protein circulating in cerebrospinal fluid. “It’s like shutting the faucet so nothing comes out,” Schoepp said in an interview. Merck hopes that by preventing production of beta amyloid - the main component of brain plaque - its drug will prevent a worsening of symptoms among patients with mild-to-moderate stages of the disease. Should the Merck drug prove safe in the Phase II safety trials, Schoepp said the medicine could eventually be tested in “prodromal” patients, or those with the very earliest signs of Alzheimer’s. They would include people with very mild memory problems who have also been shown by blood tests or brain scans to have worrisome initial buildup of amyloid plaque or who have other “bio markers” associated with the progressive memory-robbing disease. A successful Alzheimer’s treatment could reap billions of dollars in annual sales. But many experts believe treatment must be delivered before patients show signs of dementia because once that happens, brain damage may be irreversible. U.S. drugmaker Eli Lilly is also testing a beta secretase inhibitor, as well as another experimental drug called solanezumab that has shown hints of effectiveness in Phase III studies. Solanezumab also targets beta amyloid protein, but through a different mechanism than beta secretase blockers. “In addition to solanezumab, which is currently in Phase III clinical development, in July 2012 Lilly advanced our homegrown beta secretase inhibitor into Phase II clinical development for its potential to slow the progression of this devastating disease,” a Lilly spokesperson said. Schoepp noted that the Merck drug is a pill, whereas solanezumab is given by intravenous infusion. He added that solanezumab is believed to work by removing some plaque already deposited in the brain, whereas beta secretase inhibitors directly interfere with production of the beta amyloid proteins that form the plaque. “Our drug attacks the amyloid pathway directly. We’re preventing it at the beginning. You can’t get plaque if you don’t make these” protein fragments, he said. Lilly is considered ahead of the its rivals in Alzheimer’s research after solanezumab, in Phase III trials, was shown in August to slow cognitive declines in patients with mild symptoms of the disease. However, the drug failed its overall goal of delaying cognitive and physical decline in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s. The start of Merck’s new trial of MK-8931 could put the company on an equal footing with Lilly in the race for the first approved drug to delay progress of the disease. Merck’s drug appears almost to entirely prevent the formation of new beta amyloid, the toxic proteins that lead to plaques in the brain, while the Lilly drug acts by removing existing plaques, according to Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst with ISI Group. “We do not believe that Merck has any clinical efficacy data at this point upon which it is basing its Phase II/III ‘go’ decision. Thus, one must still view the Phase III as highly speculative,” Schoenebaum wrote in a research note. Assuming the U.S. Food and Drug Administration asks Lilly to conduct another confirmatory Phase III trial on its drug, the Merck drug is on roughly the same timeline to potential approval as the Lilly drug, he said. If the FDA approves the Lilly drug on its existing data, something Schoenebaum thinks is unlikely, then Lilly would be about three years ahead, he added. Merck shares were up 20 cents, or 0.45 percent at $44.50 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Lilly shares were down 10 cents at $48.94. Earlier this year, Roche Holding AG more than doubled the size of a clinical trial of its experimental Alzheimer’s drug, gantenerumab, in patients who have early Alzheimer’s but have not yet developed dementia, putting it in the vanguard of attempts to catch the disease in early stages.

Merck’s drug appears almost to entirely prevent the formation of new beta amyloid, the toxic proteins that lead to plaques in the brain, while the Lilly drug acts by removing existing plaques, according to Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst with ISI Group. “We do not believe that Merck has any clinical efficacy data at this point upon which it is basing its Phase II/III ‘go’ decision. Thus, one must still view the Phase III as highly speculative,” Schoenebaum wrote in a research note. Assuming the U.S. Food and Drug Administration asks Lilly to conduct another confirmatory Phase III trial on its drug, the Merck drug is on roughly the same timeline to potential approval as the Lilly drug, he said. If the FDA approves the Lilly drug on its existing data, something Schoenebaum thinks is unlikely, then Lilly would be about three years ahead, he added. Merck shares were up 20 cents, or 0.45 percent at $44.50 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Lilly shares were down 10 cents at $48.94. Earlier this year, Roche Holding AG more than doubled the size of a clinical trial of its experimental Alzheimer’s drug, gantenerumab, in patients who have early Alzheimer’s but have not yet developed dementia, putting it in the vanguard of attempts to catch the disease in early stages.

The move is the latest in a series of patent cancellations by India, where generic medicines account for more than 90 percent of drug sales by value and whose huge potential to western drugmakers is undermined by intellectual property issues. Earlier this year, India revoked Pfizer Inc’s patent on cancer drug Sutent, while an Indian patents appeal board overturned Roche Holding AG’s patent on hepatitis C drug Pegasys.

267,MRK,"Merck, GE to collaborate on Alzheimer's drug development","(Reuters) - Merck & Co and General Electric Co’s healthcare unit have agreed to collaborate on an experimental drug for Alzheimer’s disease, the companies said on Tuesday. GE Healthcare will supply Flutemetamol, an investigational imaging agent, to Merck for use with its experimental Alzheimer’s disease drug MK-8931. The companies hope GE’s imaging agent will help identify patients who might benefit from a therapy such as Merck’s, which targets beta amyloid, a protein that can clump together and form plaques in the brain. Such plaques have been found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease. MK-8931 is Merck’s lead Alzheimer’s drug candidate and is designed to modify progression of the disease as well as improve symptoms. Alzheimer’s robs patients of their memory and can cause other cognitive disturbances. Based on promising results from an early-stage clinical trial of MK-8931, Merck plans to move forward with a larger trial, called EPOCH, at multiple sites around the world. Flutemetamol is a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent that has been able, in clinical trials, to detect beta amyloid in the brain.

269,MRK,Merck cholesterol drug fails; risks seen,"(Reuters) - A major trial of Merck & Co Inc’s Tredaptive medicine to increase “good” HDL cholesterol has raised safety concerns and showed it was no better at preventing heart attacks, deaths or strokes than traditional statin drugs that lower “bad” LDL cholesterol, the company said on Thursday. Merck said the experimental medicine had significantly raised the incidence of some types of nonfatal but serious side effects in the study, which followed more than 25,000 patients for almost four years. Merck shares fell 2.5 percent to $42.56 in midday trading on the failure of one of its most closely watched experimental drugs. Tredaptive combines an extended release form of niacin, a nutrient that has been used for decades to raise HDL cholesterol, with a drug called laropiprant, which is meant to reduce the incidence of facial flushing that is a side effect of niacin therapy. Merck said it no longer planned to seek regulatory approval for the drug in the United States and is advising doctors in other countries against starting new patients on it. The medicine was approved in the European Union in 2008, but U.S. regulators were unwilling to approve it until Merck conducted the costly long-term study to better assess its safety and effectiveness. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been especially concerned about potential heart risks from laropiprant. The failed study, called HPS2-THRIVE, is the latest high-profile trial that has called the heart-protective value of niacin into question. Merck said Tredaptive had sales of about $13 million for the first three quarters of 2012 in the 40 countries where it is already sold. Had the drug been successful in the HPS2-THRIVE study, brokerage Cowen and Co predicted its annual global sales would have jumped to $300 million by 2016. Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson had forecast Tredaptive sales of $1.1 billion by 2020, had it been approved in the United States. “It seems conceivable that the drug could be removed from the market” overseas, he said in a research note. Merck is developing another drug, anacetrapib, which raises HDL cholesterol by a greater magnitude than niacin, to see if it can reduce risks of heart attacks and stroke. If that trial is successful, many industry analysts believe anacetrapib could become a huge seller. Anderson said data from late-stage testing of anacetrapib should become available in 2017, while results from trials of evacetrapib, a similar drug from Eli Lilly, should be unveiled in late 2015. Garret FitzGerald, chairman of pharmacology at the University of Pennsylvania, said negative findings for Tredaptive should not lessen enthusiasm for anacetrapib and evacetrapib because they raise HDL through a different mechanism from niacin. Instead, they block a protein called CETP. ",12202012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-merck-cholesterol/merck-cholesterol-drug-fails-risks-seen-idUSBRE8BJ0RU20121220

The medicine was approved for use in Europe in 2008, but U.S. regulators were unwilling to approve it until Merck conducted the costly long-term study to better assess its safety and effectiveness. Launching the review, the European Medicines Agency on Friday defended its decision to approve the drug, saying it was based on a full assessment of the evidence available at the time, including results from trials involving several thousand patients, which showed the benefits outweighed the risks. “A risk management programme was established at the time to follow up on various issues concerning the use of the product,” the agency told Reuters. “This included a requirement for the company to submit the results of a large, long-term study, the HPS2-THRIVE Study, which are now being made available.” Merck said on Thursday it no longer planned to seek regulatory approval for the drug in the United States and recommended doctors did not start new patients on Tredaptive in countries where it is already available.

Merck began recalling the drug, which is also sold under the brand names Pelzont and Trevaclyn, on Jan. 11 and recommended that doctors stop prescribing it. The medicine had been on the market in 40 countries worldwide, but is not approved in the United States.

284,MRK,Merck CEO says jury out on raising good cholesterol,"DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - The jury is still out on the benefits of increasing “good” HDL cholesterol, but the strategy remains worth pursuing, despite recent setbacks, the chief executive of said on Thursday. Confidence in the HDL thesis suffered a fresh blow last month when a major clinical trial of Merck’s Tredaptive medicine failed. That followed earlier failures with two other HDL-boosting drugs from Pfizer and Roche. The Pfizer and Roche drugs worked differently to Tredaptive, by inhibiting a protein called CETP, and Merck is also developing a key experimental product in this area. Merck CEO Ken Frazier, speaking in Davos on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, said the U.S. drugmaker would continue to press ahead with clinical research on HDL raising, even though the scientific case so far remained inconclusive. “The Tredaptive failure is another piece of evidence on the side of the scale that says HDL raising hasn’t yet been proven,” he said. “I don’t think by any means, though, that the question of HDL raising as a positive factor in cardiovascular health has been settled.” Tredaptive, which is now being taken off the market in those countries where it was sold, combined an extended release form of niacin, to raise HDL, with a drug to cut the incidence of facial flushing that is a side effect of niacin therapy. Merck is developing another drug called anacetrapib, which targets CETP and raises HDL cholesterol by much more than niacin, to see if it can reduce risks of heart attacks and stroke. If that trial succeeds, anacetrapib would address a huge market, and the medicine could be a decisive factor in Merck’s commercial success in the years ahead. But investors’ confidence in the whole approach of lifting HDL is shaky. “It’s certainly not a slam dunk, but I believe that given the properties of the drug, it is an experiment well worth conducting,” Frazier said of the ongoing anacetrapib trial. Anacetrapib belongs to the same cholesterol-ester transfer protein (CETP) class as Pfizer’s high-profile drug torcetrapib, which was ditched in 2006 due to adverse side effects, and Roche’s dalcetrapib, which was dropped last year due to lack of efficacy. On both those fronts, Frazier believes the Merck product has an edge, since there is no evidence that it causes the unwanted side effects seen with torcetrapib, and it is also able to lower “bad” LDL, which Roche’s product did not. Another similar drug, evacetrapib, is under development from Eli Lilly.

285,MRK,FDA OKs Merck OTC version of overactive bladder drug,"(Reuters) - Health regulators approved Merck & Co’s nonprescription version of Oxytrol to treat overactive bladder in women ages 18 and older, the agency said on Friday. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said the over-the-counter version of Oxytrol would be available for women only and that the drug remained available to men by prescription. Overactive bladder, which affects an estimated 33 million Americans, is a condition in which the bladder squeezes too often or without warning. Symptoms include leaking urine, feeling a sudden and urgent need to urinate, and frequent urination. Oxytrol for Women is a patch that contains oxybutynin, a medicine that helps relax the bladder muscle, and is designed to be applied to the skin every four days, the FDA said. Oxybutynin belongs to a class of drugs known as anticholinergics. Pfizer Inc’s Detrol is the market leader in the class with annual sales of about $700 million. Oxytrol will be the first drug in the class to be sold over the counter. Merck licensed exclusive rights to sell OTC Oxytrol from Actavis Inc, the generic drugmaker formerly known as Watson Pharmaceuticals. Merck said it expected the OTC patch to be available in the fall. The FDA decided to approve the OTC version of the Merck drug, based on the results of nine studies of women that demonstrated that consumers can understand the information on the label, properly determine whether the product is right for them, and use the drug appropriately, the agency said. Last week, the FDA approved the popular wrinkle treatment Botox from Allergan Inc to treat overactive bladder in people who cannot tolerate drugs from the class to which Oxytrol belongs or are not helped by these medications. Merck shares rose 3 cents to $43.03 on the New York Stock Exchange.

288,MRK,Merck shares fall on worries about osteoporosis drug,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc’s quarterly results beat estimates, but the drugmaker issued a cautious 2013 profit forecast and said it will delay seeking approval for a high-profile osteoporosis drug, sending its shares down 3 percent. Merck will not submit its osteoporosis treatment odanacatib to U.S. regulators until next year. Some analysts had predicted the medicine could generate annual sales of up to $2 billion, if approved. “We continue to believe in the potential of this drug, and look forward to filing it in 2014,” Chief Executive Kenneth Frazier said on a conference call with analysts who expressed concern about the delay. Merck research chief Peter Kim told analysts he had seen complete data from a large Phase III trial of the drug. But he said the company would delay a marketing application to submit data from an “extension” trial, or a follow-up observation of patients who had completed the study. He did not cite any specific problems with the drug. An independent monitoring board last July recommended the Phase III study be stopped because its data had already proven odanacatib reduced fracture risk. But the panel flagged certain potential safety concerns. Merck continued with the extension trial, largely to better examine the safety issues, which have not been publicly identified. Merck’s older Fosamax osteoporosis treatment was the world’s top seller, with annual sales of $3 billion until its U.S. patent lapsed in 2008 and generics flooded the market. The No. 2 U.S. drugmaker earned $1.4 billion, or 46 cents per share, in the fourth quarter. That compared with $1.51 billion, or 49 cents per share, a year earlier, when it took charges for acquisition and restructuring expenses. Excluding special items, Merck earned 83 cents per share. Analysts, on average, expected 81 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Global company sales fell 5 percent to $11.74 billion, hurt by generic competition for its Singulair asthma drug, but still beat analysts’ estimates of $11.48 billion. The company forecast 2013 earnings of $3.60 to $3.70 per share, excluding special items. The midpoint of that range is below analysts’ estimate of $3.68 per share. The company earned $3.82 per share in 2012. Merck predicted sales in 2013 would be similar to 2012 levels, excluding foreign exchange factors, as Singulair generics continue to take their toll. “Merck’s 2013 (earnings) guidance was a bit conservative, which could point to higher expenses” this year, said Judson Clark, an analyst with Edward Jones. But he said the flat sales forecast was welcome because analysts were expecting somewhat lower sales. Peter Kellogg, the chief financial officer, said few drugmakers are able to keep sales steady if one of their major medicines faces cheaper generics. “That means we have a tremendously healthy portfolio of other products to provide compensating growth,” Kellogg said in an interview. Clark predicted Merck’s earnings would rebound next year and grow in the high-single-digit range in percentage terms, as experimental drugs are approved and bring in new revenue. “We think Merck has one of the best drug pipelines in the industry and that it will drive growth,” Clark said. Merck, whose $6 billion-a-year Singulair lost U.S. marketing exclusivity in August, is girding for more pain from cheaper copycats. Its Maxalt migraine drug, with $600 million in annual sales, goes generic in December, and its near-blockbuster Temodar brain cancer medicine faces generics next year. Merck said Friday it aims to seek marketing approval this year for five drugs, including suvorexant for insomnia. It is counting on the new drugs to help cushion plunging sales of Singulair, Maxalt and Temodar. Merck suffered a major setback in January, when an experimental cholesterol drug called Tredaptive failed to prevent heart problems and raised safety concerns. The drug, which was expected to become a big seller in the United States, was recalled in Europe following the negative study findings. Singulair sales plunged 67 percent in the quarter to $480 million. Combined sales of diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet rose 18 percent to $1.6 billion, fueled by growth in the United States and Japan. Sales of Gardasil, its vaccine to prevent cervical cancer, jumped 61 percent to $442 million, helped by higher public sector purchases and demand in Japan and emerging markets. Merck shares were down $1.35, or 3.1 percent, to 41.90 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

293,MRK,Vaccine group funds cervical cancer immunisations for poor,"* Eight countries to start pilot projects backed by GAVI * Cervical cancer HPV vaccines are made by Merck and GSK * Over 85 pct of cervical cancer deaths are in poor nations By Kate Kelland LONDON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - The GAVI global vaccines group is to help protect more than 180,000 girls in eight countries across Africa and Asia from cervical cancer by funding immunisation projects with vaccines from Merck and GlaxoSmithKline. The non-profit GAVI Alliance, which funds bulk-buy vaccination programmes for poor nations, said on Monday that Ghana, Kenya, Laos, Madagascar, Malawi, Niger, Sierra Leone and Tanzania would be the first countries to get its support for cervical cancer protection pilot projects. Merck’s Gardasil and GSK’s Cervarix vaccines are the world’s only two approved shots designed to protect against the sexually transmitted human papillomavirus (HPV) that causes the vast majority of cervical cancer cases. More than 85 percent of cervical cancer deaths occur in developing nations and 275,000 women die of the disease each year. This means cervical cancer now kills more women worldwide than childbirth, claiming a life every two minutes, GAVI said. Experts say the annual worldwide cervical cancer death rate could rise to 430,000 by 2030 if no action is taken to protect more women from it. “Introducing the HPV vaccine in developing countries is the start of a global effort to protect all girls against cervical cancer,” GAVI chief executive Seth Berkley said in a statement. A study published in 2011 found that since 1980 new cervical cancer case numbers and deaths have dropped substantially in rich countries - many of which have screening programmes and have also recently introduced HPV vaccinations - but risen dramatically in Africa and other poor regions. GAVI - backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Health Organization, the World Bank, UNICEF, donor governments and others - has been working with the vaccine manufacturers to secure the most affordable price for the shots. Merck has said it is prepared to offer Gardasil to GAVI countries at a deeply discounted price of $5 per dose, meaning a three-dose course would cost $15. GAVI has previously described this as a “a good starting offer”. The pilot projects are designed to give countries a chance to test whether they can put in place the systems needed to roll out HPV vaccines nationally. Unlike most other vaccines, which are given to babies and children under age five, HPV vaccines are designed to be given to girls aged nine to 13 in an effort to protect them before they are likely to become sexually active. One major challenge to effectively delivering HPV vaccines is that many developing countries do not offer routine health services for girls in this age group. But GAVI said initial experience in offering HPV vaccines through schools in Africa, Asia and Latin America had been encouraging. By 2015, GAVI says it hopes to help more than 20 countries immunise around a million girls with HPV vaccines through pilot projects, and by 2020 it hopes to have helped more than 30 million girls in over 40 countries to get the vaccine.",2042013,http://www.reuters.com/article/cancer-cervical-vaccine/vaccine-group-funds-cervical-cancer-immunisations-for-poor-idUSL5N0B344W20130204
294,MRK,"Merck hit with $285,000 verdict in Fosamax trial","NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal jury on Tuesday ordered Merck & Co Inc to pay $285,000 in a lawsuit over the risks of its osteoporosis drug Fosamax, the second loss for the company after several earlier trials. The eight-person jury in U.S. District Court in Manhattan found that Merck failed to warn plaintiff Rhoda Scheinberg’s doctors of the risks associated with Fosamax. The jury rejected the plaintiff’s argument that Fosamax was a defective product. More than 4,000 lawsuits are pending in federal and state courts arising out of injuries allegedly caused by the one-time blockbuster medication. Seven cases have now gone to trial, and Merck has won five and lost two. This latest trial was one of the so-called “bellwether” cases in the Fosamax litigation. Judges order bellwethers in mass litigation to assess trends and outcomes that could play out in similar lawsuits. A string of wins by plaintiffs could, for example, give them a stronger hand in settlement talks with defendants to end all of the cases. Lawyers for Scheinberg, a 69-year-old New York resident, contended Fosamax caused her to suffer delayed healing and a bone disease of the jaw after a tooth extraction. The jury found that Merck’s failure to warn of the drug’s risks was a cause of her injury. “With this victory, this litigation has a renewed purpose and a renewed focus,” Tim O’Brien, a lawyer for Scheinberg who also represents other plaintiffs in Fosamax lawsuits, said in a statement. Merck said in a statement that it disagreed with the verdict and noted that the jury returned a mixed verdict. “Merck provided appropriate warnings, and the plaintiff was at increased risk for dental and jaw problems regardless of whether she was taking Fosamax,” said Merck lawyer Chilton Varner of law firm King & Spalding. The lawsuit, filed in 2008, was one of 975 pending before U.S. District Judge John Keenan in New York after a judicial panel consolidated Fosamax cases alleging jaw-related injuries. Another 842 lawsuits alleging femur injuries are pending in the U.S. District Court in New Jersey. Other lawsuits are pending in state courts. The only other Fosamax case that Merck has lost at trial resulted in a $8 million verdict by a federal jury in Manhattan in June 2010 for Shirley Boles, a Florida woman who alleged she developed osteonecrosis of the jaw after taking the drug. In October 2010, Keenan reduced the verdict to $1.5 million. Merck is appealing the case. Fosamax had annual sales of $3 billion until its U.S. patent lapsed in 2008 and generic versions flooded the market.

297,MRK,Appeals court upholds patent on Merck's Vytorin,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The patent on Merck & Co’s cholesterol fighters Zetia and Vytorin, two of the drugmaker’s biggest products, is valid, a U.S. appeals court ruled on Thursday. Vytorin combines Zocor, a member of the statin family developed by Merck, with a newer Merck cholesterol treatment called Zetia. Sales of Vytorin are $1.75 billion while sales of Zetia used by itself are another $2.6 billion a year. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit did not discuss the ruling at length and simply affirmed a decision by a lower court in New Jersey. The U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey had ruled in April that the patent on Merck’s Zetia and on Vytorin was valid and issued an injunction blocking approval of a generic version by Mylan Inc until the patent expires. The patent expires in April 2017, Merck said. “We invest heavily in the R&D; that is needed to discover innovative medicines like Vytorin and Zetia, and we will vigorously defend our intellectual property rights,” Merck spokesman Ron Rogers said in an statement. Mylan did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Zocor, which is available as a generic, cuts the liver’s production of “bad” LDL cholesterol while Zetia blocks absorption of LDL in the intestines. Vytorin, which combines both in a pill, was approved by U.S. regulators in 2004. Although Vytorin is a big seller, demand for it has been hurt by uncertainty whether the combination of drugs lowers risk of heart attack and stroke any more than using Zocor alone.

301,MRK,Merck to pay $688 million to settle Enhance lawsuits,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co (MRK.N) has agreed to pay $688 million to settle two U.S. class-action lawsuits by shareholders who said they lost money because the company concealed the poor results of a clinical trial of the anti-cholesterol drug Vytorin. The federal lawsuits, led by several pension funds, alleged that Merck and Schering-Plough Corp knew more than a year in advance that the trial, known as Enhance, was a failure, but withheld that information from investors. Shares of Merck fell nearly 15 percent and Schering fell nearly 21 percent on March 31, 2008, the first trading day after full trial results were released at the American Conference of Cardiology in Chicago. The companies merged in November 2009. Law firms representing some of the plaintiffs said the combined settlements are among the 10 largest in a securities class-action that did not involve a restatement of financial results. Christopher McDonald, a partner at Labaton Sucharow representing Schering investors, in a telephone interview said the settlements allow a “significant recovery” for shareholders. He said that while the federal government has been successful in pursuing large fraud cases against some pharmaceutical companies, “it hasn’t translated into any significant uptick in settlements of securities cases.” Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, said it has recorded a $493 million after-tax charge for the settlements, reducing the company’s previously reported profit per share for the 2012 fourth quarter to 30 cents from 46 cents. Bruce Kuhlik, Merck’s general counsel, in a statement said the settlements avoid the uncertainties of a jury trial, which had been scheduled to begin March 4. Merck also said it believes both companies acted responsibly in connection with the Enhance trial, and that the settlements include no admission of liability or wrongdoing. “There’s probably some merit (to the claims) or they wouldn’t have settled for such a large amount,” Judson Clark, a health care analyst with Edward Jones, said in a telephone interview. He has a “buy” rating on Merck. Shares of Merck fell 26 cents to $40.89 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The Enhance trial had sought to demonstrate that Vytorin, a combination drug marketed by Merck and Schering, was more effective than a competing drug in combating atherosclerosis, the buildup of plaque in artery walls. But the companies announced in January 2008 that Vytorin did not stop plaque any better than an inexpensive statin, Zocor, in high-risk patients with an inherited form of heart disease, though it did significantly reduce cholesterol levels. Two months later, in announcing full results of the Enhance trial at the Chicago conference, a panel of doctors urged patients to try older cholesterol drugs before Vytorin and Zetia, which Merck and Schering also sold jointly. Vytorin pairs Zetia with the active ingredient of Zocor. Zetia helps block absorption of “bad” LDL cholesterol in the intestines, and Zocor helps block production by the liver of LDL cholesterol. Zetia sales totaled $2.57 billion and Vytorin sales totaled $1.75 billion in 2012. Combined sales have fallen 17 percent since 2007, before the Enhance trial results were released. Merck posted total sales of $47.27 billion for 2012. Merck said it will pay $215 million to settle a lawsuit brought by investors in its securities, and $473 million to settle a lawsuit by Schering investors. The class period runs from December 6, 2006, through March 28, 2008, for Merck investors, and from January 3, 2007, to March 28, 2008, for Schering investors, court papers show.

302,MRK,UPDATE 3-Merck to pay $688 mln to settle Enhance lawsuits,"* Results of Vytorin test disappointed investors * Merck, Schering-Plough co-marketed drug; later merged * Court approval of settlement required By Jonathan Stempel Feb 14 (Reuters) - Merck & Co has agreed to pay $688 million to settle two U.S. class-action lawsuits by shareholders who said they lost money because the company concealed the poor results of a clinical trial of the anti-cholesterol drug Vytorin. The federal lawsuits, led by several pension funds, alleged that Merck and Schering-Plough Corp knew more than a year in advance that the trial, known as Enhance, was a failure, but withheld that information from investors. Shares of Merck fell nearly 15 percent and Schering fell nearly 21 percent on March 31, 2008, the first trading day after full trial results were released at the American Conference of Cardiology in Chicago. The companies merged in November 2009. Law firms representing some of the plaintiffs said the combined settlements are among the 10 largest in a securities class-action that did not involve a restatement of financial results. Christopher McDonald, a partner at Labaton Sucharow representing Schering investors, in a telephone interview said the settlements allow a “significant recovery” for shareholders. He said that while the federal government has been successful in pursuing large fraud cases against some pharmaceutical companies, “it hasn’t translated into any significant uptick in settlements of securities cases.” Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, said it has recorded a $493 million after-tax charge for the settlements, reducing the company’s previously reported profit per share for the 2012 fourth quarter to 30 cents from 46 cents.

304,MRK,High-stakes cholesterol study could lift Merck cloud,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Favorable results from a huge heart study could help redeem investors’ faith in Merck & Co and its two biggest cholesterol drugs, Vytorin and Zetia, and potentially add billions of dollars in annual revenue. Investors have soured on the No. 2 U.S. drugmaker since late December, following setbacks to a closely watched experimental drug for osteoporosis and a newer cholesterol medicine. Those concerns come on top of investor anxiety over the outcome of the study of 18,000 heart patients called IMPROVE-IT that has contributed to Merck’s shares lagging rival large drugmakers by about 10 percentage points in that short period. An independent monitoring board is expected to complete an interim analysis of the study in March, and decide whether it should continue as planned until September 2014. Sales of Vytorin and Zetia have fallen since 2008 because of concerns about their effectiveness and safety. “If the data are extremely good, and statistically significant, that would be a big win for Merck, and there’s no reason combined sales of Vytorin and Zetia couldn’t climb by billions” of dollars, said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover. The IMPROVE-IT study involves patients with already well-controlled cholesterol who had heart attacks or the kind of chest pain that can precede heart attacks. It looks to determine if Merck’s $1.75 billion-a-year Vytorin pill can significantly reduce heart attacks, strokes and heart-related deaths compared with the company’s older, generically-available Zocor. Vytorin, approved in 2004, combines Zocor with Zetia, so the study is a measure of the clinical benefit of adding Zetia, which lowers bad LDL cholesterol by blocking the liver’s production of the blood fat. Zetia, which is also sold separately and has annual sales of almost $2.6 billion, is prescribed by doctors as a standalone treatment or to add to the cholesterol-lowering power of statins, such as Zocor or Lipitor. The monitoring board, based upon data only it has the right to see, could order an early halt to the trial if it believes the data already show Vytorin is more heart protective than Zocor, if it deems Vytorin to be clearly no better than Zocor or if safety problems arise with Vytorin. Blinded studies have independent safety monitoring boards to make sure drugs are not harmful, or are so effective that it would be unethical not to offer the meds to the placebo group. “If the trial stops because it shows efficacy, Merck shares could rise a great deal - 10 or 15 percent, or even more,” as the overhang on Merck shares is lifted, said Barclays Capital analyst Tony Butler. The most likely scenario is that the monitoring board will take no action, and allow the trial to continue to its planned 2014 conclusion, analysts say. Butler, however, estimated there was a 40 percent chance that the board would determine Vytorin is superior to Zocor and order the trial halted. “There’s an extraordinarily small probability, maybe 5 or 10 percent, that the trial stops due to some kind of harm,” Butler added. Morningstar’s Conover said he is guardedly optimistic about positive results from IMPROVE-IT, either next month, or when the trial runs its planned full course. “There’s a cloudy outlook on Vytorin, but we feel the trial will show a trend towards efficacy,” meaning better results than Zocor that might not reach statistical significance, he said. But Merck shares could fall 10 percent or more if Vytorin fails to beat Zocor in preventing cardiovascular events, and demand for Vytorin and Zetia would wilt, analysts said. “Global sales of Zetia and Vytorin could decline by 50 to 70 percent” in that event, according to Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez, and take Merck shares sharply lower. Fernandez said he expects Vytorin to trump Zocor in the study, although he estimated the boost in combined Vytorin and Zetia sales would be only $500 million to $1 billion in 2016. The prospects of rejuvenated sales of the cholesterol drugs could bolster faith in Merck that flagged after it scrapped plans to seek U.S. approval for a pill called Tredaptive used to increase “good” HDL cholesterol, and said it would delay seeking approval of an osteoporosis drug called odanacatib, prompting safety concerns for a medicine that some analysts had hoped would become a $2 billion-a-year brand. Combined Vytorin and Zetia sales had soared to about $5 billion, until January 2008, when Vytorin proved no better at preventing plaque in neck arteries than Zocor in another large trial called ENHANCE. It involved high-risk patients with an inherited form of heart disease. Merck on Thursday agreed to pay $688 million to settle two U.S. class-action lawsuits by shareholders who alleged the company knew more than a year in advance that the trial was a failure, but withheld that information from investors. Merck, in agreeing to the settlement, denied any wrongdoing. Safety concerns over Zetia also arose in 2008, when another trial called SEAS appeared to suggest a link to higher rates of cancer deaths, although that was later disproved to the satisfaction of most doctors. But a clean safety result from IMPROVE-IT can only help to reassure doubters.

Merck, after recent setbacks for some of its most important experimental drugs, said former Amgen Inc research chief Roger Perlmutter will take over from Kim on April 15, although Kim, 55, will stay on as a company advisor until August. “This is an acknowledgement by Merck that the status quo wasn’t getting desired results,” said analyst Barbara Ryan of Barbara Ryan Advisors. The appointment represents a homecoming for Perlmutter, 60, who joined Amgen in February 2001 after four years with Merck, where he oversaw global basic research and preclinical development. While at Amgen sales of its Epogen and Aranesp anemia drugs plunged due to safety concerns. But Perlmutter helped Amgen, the world’s biggest biotechnology company, branch out into new areas — including successful development of Prolia for osteoporosis and Sensipar, used to treat dangerously high calcium levels in the blood. It is testing treatments for cancer, cholesterol, psoriasis and a promising new type of osteoporosis drug. Most of the Amgen drugs are biologics, meaning they are injectable products made in living cells and involve a costly manufacturing process. But biotech drugs command far higher prices than conventional pills, making them an increasing focus for drugmakers. “Merck may become more aggressive now in acquiring and developing more biotech drugs,” with Perlmutter as research chief, Ryan predicted. Perlmutter became Amgen’s research chief only months after Kim, then a 42-year-old professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was selected to head research at Merck. Merck has had several big successes under Kim’s watch, including development of its blockbuster Januvia diabetes medicine, its Gardasil vaccine to prevent cervical cancer, its Zostavax shingles vaccine and its Isentress treatment for HIV. But more recently, it has been hurt by failed trials of cholesterol treatment Tredaptive and migraine drug telcagepant, and a regulatory delay for a new type of osteoporosis medicine called odanacatib. Merck’s Vioxx arthritis drug was recalled in 2004 after being linked to heart attacks and strokes, forcing Kim to defend controversial clinical trials of the pill that were conducted before his arrival. New medicines are badly needed at Merck, where sales of its onetime $6 billion-a-year Singulair asthma drug are plunging due to generic competition and other medicines will soon face cheaper generics. Moreover, cost savings from Merck’s 2009 purchase of rival Schering Plough have mostly dried up and are no longer able to boost company earnings. “On balance, most investors we speak with have been disappointed by Peter Kim’s tenure as head of Merck’s R&D;,” Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a research note on Thursday. “We believe a transition makes sense at this time.” Fernandez said he believed Perlmutter’s 10-year tenure at Amgen were “constructive. Overall he strikes us as a thoughtful straight shooter and a decisive leader.” Merck praised Kim’s tenure. “His contributions have positioned us well for future success.” Shares of Merck were down nearly 1 percent in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

310,MRK,Serious side effects seen with failed Merck niacin drug,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Unexpected serious side effects arose in a huge study of a Merck & Co long-acting niacin drug aimed at raising good HDL cholesterol, according to data released on Saturday, possibly adding another nail to the coffin of niacin therapy for heart patients. Merck has already given up on the drug that combines extended-release niacin with an experimental agent called laropiprant, designed to prevent the uncomfortable facial flushing associated with niacin. When it was announced that the drug called Tredaptive had failed to prevent heart attacks, strokes, death and other complications in heart patients also taking drugs to lower bad LDL cholesterol, Merck said it would not seek U.S. approval and would stop selling it in the dozens of other countries where it was already available. A European medical journal last week said the drug caused concerning muscle weakness, especially in Asian patients. But the results presented on Saturday at the American College of Cardiology scientific meeting in San Francisco painted an even more troubling picture of the medicine. Researchers found patients taking the Merck drug had significantly higher rates of bleeding - 2.5 percent vs. 1.9 percent - and infections - 8.0 percent vs. 6.6 percent - that they called unexpected. Significantly higher numbers of patients taking Tredaptive also experienced serious health problems that researchers called known side effects of niacin. Those included new onset diabetes - 9.1 percent vs. 7.3 percent - diabetic complications - 11.1 percent vs. 7.5 percent - and gastrointestinal problems - 4.8 percent vs. 3.8 percent. Niacin, a form of vitamin B, has been used for many years in the belief that its HDL raising powers would help prevent heart attacks and strokes. Professor Jane Armitage, who led the study called HPS2-Thrive, called the findings disappointing. “Still,” she said, “finding out a drug is not helping people is just as important as finding that it has benefits.” But Dr. Steven Nissen, head of cardiology at Cleveland Clinic, had some serious criticism about the study’s design, execution and conclusions, and was not prepared to write off niacin therapy just yet for patients with very low HDL levels. “Sometimes large and simple trials are large and sloppy trials,” he said. Among his concerns Nissen cited the very large number of Asians in the study that could have skewed the results because Asians tend to not tolerate high dose niacin. Nissen also said the baseline LDL levels of 66 for patients in the study were unrealistically low and that those with higher LDL levels may have benefited from the drug. The trial was not designed to show whether the adverse side effects were caused by the niacin or the anti-flushing drug, another potential failing. But Armitage, a professor at the University of Oxford, said the results were consistent with an earlier failed niacin study that did not include laropiprant and that many of the side effects are known to be associated with niacin. “We now know that its adverse side effects outweigh the benefits when used with current treatments,” she said. Nissen was not so sure, saying this was not the final nail in the niacin therapy coffin. “There are some nails in the coffin. But it doesn’t absolutely answer the question,” he said of the study. “I don’t know that it was the niacin. They may be right, but they may be wrong.” ",3092013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-heart-niacin-merck/serious-side-effects-seen-with-failed-merck-niacin-drug-idUSBRE9280G620130309

312,MRK,Vytorin study to continue after review; Merck shares jump,"(Reuters) - An independent monitoring board said a large trial of Merck & Co’s Vytorin cholesterol drug can continue, suggesting no major safety issues have yet been seen with the pill. The news eased investor concerns that a safety issue could arise and further hurt sales of already struggling Vytorin. Merck shares were up 3.7 percent in Tuesday morning trading. “We believe it is increasingly difficult to suggest any safety issues with (Vytorin),” JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said, in view of the panel’s green light to continue with the study. Such panels of medical experts, which are allowed to examine confidential clinical trial data, are routinely used to assess whether drug studies should continue or be halted because they have already proven a drug is effective, ineffective or has safety problems. Investors have been avidly awaiting an update from the panel on the study of Vytorin, called IMPROVE-IT, which began in 2005 and involves more than 18,000 patients with well-controlled cholesterol who had heart attacks or the kind of chest pain that can precede heart attacks. The study will now continue until its planned conclusion in September 2014, Merck said on Tuesday. The study aims to prove conclusively whether Vytorin, whose annual sales total $1.75 billion, can significantly reduce heart attacks, strokes and heart-related deaths compared with Merck’s older, generically-available Zocor (simvastatin) cholesterol fighter. “Getting this interim look out of the way is a positive, given where investor sentiment has been,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note. He said “a surprising number of investors” have been worried about potential safety issues with Vytorin. Doubts about the true worth of Vytorin and a related Merck drug called Zetia, and debates about their safety, have hurt sales of the medicines since 2008, after a pair of smaller studies showed unfavorable trends. Vytorin combines Zocor with Zetia, a $2.6 billion-a-year product that Merck also sells as a standalone treatment. Zetia and Zocor block “bad” LDL cholesterol through different mechanisms, the reason they are paired in Vytorin. The IMPROVE-IT study was begun in 2005, a year after Vytorin was introduced, to get a far better picture of the combo drug’s worth and safety than could be seen in earlier trials that led to its approval. Merck investors are hoping the final IMPROVE-IT results next year will establish Vytorin’s clear effectiveness and safety, and thereby spark revived sales of Vytorin and Zetia.

313,MRK,UPDATE 2-Vytorin study to continue after review; Merck shares jump,"* High-stakes trial to continue until September 2014 * Go-ahead soothes investor concerns about safety * Merck shares climb 3.7 percent By Ransdell Pierson and Caroline Humer March 12 (Reuters) - An independent monitoring board said a large trial of Merck & Co’s Vytorin cholesterol drug can continue, suggesting no major safety issues have yet been seen with the pill. The news eased investor concerns that a safety issue could arise and further hurt sales of already struggling Vytorin. Merck shares were up 3.7 percent in Tuesday morning trading. “We believe it is increasingly difficult to suggest any safety issues with (Vytorin),” JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said, in view of the panel’s green light to continue with the study.

316,MRK,FDA studies possible pre-cancerous link with diabetes drugs,"(Reuters) - The Food and Drug Administration is studying unconfirmed reports that a widely used class of diabetes drugs, which includes Merck & Co’s Januvia, may cause inflammation of the pancreas and pre-cancerous changes to the pancreas. The agency, in a notice on its website on Thursday, said this is the first time it has communicated potential pre-cancerous links to the medicines, known as incretin mimetics. The drugs for type 2 diabetes also include Victoza from Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk and Onglyza from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and AstraZeneca Plc. Patients should continue taking their medicines as directed until speaking with healthcare professionals, the agency said. The FDA said it is investigating findings from academic researchers that highlighted the potential risk. “These findings were based on examination of a small number of pancreatic tissue specimens taken from patients after they died from unspecified causes,” the agency said. The FDA has asked the researchers to explain how they collected and studied the specimens and to provide tissue samples so the agency can further assess any possible risks. In the meantime, the FDA said it has not reached any new conclusions about safety risks of the class of drugs. The agency noted it has previously warned the public about acute pancreatitis, including fatal and nonfatal cases, seen with the medicines. Package insert labels for the class of drugs already warn about risk of the potentially dangerous inflammation. “It’s too early to tell, but we’ll keep an eye on it,” Edward Jones analyst Judson Clark said, when asked about the significance of the potential safety issues in Thursday’s FDA advisory. But Clark said he did not expect any immediate changes in prescribing habits for the drugs because the pancreatitis risk is already noted on the drug labels. The class of medicines, which mimic a natural hormone called incretin, prompt the pancreas to release insulin when blood sugar is rising. They are approved to treat type 2 diabetes, the most common form of diabetes which usually develops in adulthood and is closely linked to obesity. Merck’s Januvia and its related drug, Janumet, had combined sales last year of almost $6 billion, making them by far the company’s biggest product franchise. Onglyza and a related drug called Kombiglyze had sales last year of $709 million. Shares of Merck were down 1.1 percent at $44.08, while Bristol-Myers shares were down 0.8 percent at $38.18 on Thursday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of AstraZeneca were up 1 percent at $46.31, also on the NYSE. Novo Nordisk shares closed down 1 percent in Copenhagen.

318,MRK,Merck anesthesia-reversal agent faces new delay,"(Reuters) - The Food and Drug Administration will not complete its review of Merck & Co’s experimental medicine to reverse the effects of anesthesia until the second half of 2013, representing a three-month delay, the drugmaker said. Merck acquired the product, called sugammadex, through its merger in 2009 with Schering-Plough Corp. The product has faced numerous regulatory delays but is deemed by many analysts and doctors to be one of the biggest advances in anesthesia in decades. The FDA in 2008 said it could not approve sugammadex until Merck provided more clinical trial data related to allergic reactions and blood clots, possible side effects of the drug. Merck early this year said it had completed the necessary trials and that the FDA had accepted the company’s resubmitted marketing application for the drug. Merck spokeswoman Pam Eisele on Friday said the FDA, in notifying the drugmaker about the expected delay in making a decision on the drug, did not cite any new safety issues. “We’ve maintained regular meetings and discussions with the FDA, with a commitment to making sugammadex available in the United States,” she said. Sugammadex is already sold in 75 countries under the brand name Bridion and had 2012 global sales of $261 million. That makes it a modest-sized product for Merck, the second-largest U.S. drugmaker. Cowen and Co has projected global annual sales for the drug of $575 million by 2016, if it is approved in the United States. It would be the first in a new class of medicines in the United States known as selective relaxant binding agents. It is designed to inactivate the effects of two widely used anesthesia drugs, rocuronium and vecuronium, and thereby help patients recover far more quickly from anesthesia.

324,MRK,Experimental sleep drug may cause fewer side effects -Merck study,"* Findings suggest drug may not impair memory, attention * Merck’s sleep drug now before FDA By Julie Steenhuysen CHICAGO, April 3 (Reuters) - A study in rats and monkeys suggests an experimental Merck & Co  sleep drug may help induce sleep without causing the memory loss and attention problems sometimes seen in the commonly used drugs Ambien and Lunesta, company researchers said on Wednesday. Experiments in animals suggest Merck’s sleep drug Suvorexant, now before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, may avoid these side effects, the company said. Insomnia affects about 10 percent of U.S. adults, and roughly a third of these individuals take drugs to help them sleep. Most sleep aids, including Sanofi’s Ambien or Sunovion Pharmaceuticals’ Lunesta, act on a key neurotransmitter in the brain called GABA. “These treatments work by forcing the brain to go to sleep,” said study leader Jason Uslaner of Merck in an interview on the website of Science Translational Medicine, which published the study. GABA receptors are important to many brain regions, including those important for cognition, which is likely why common sleep aids can cause memory loss and attention problems. “When you hit those, you don’t just hit the sleep system,” John Renger, executive director and head of neruoscience basic research at Merck and one of the study’s authors, said in a telephone interview. Suvorexant is part of a class of drugs called Dual Orexin Receptor Antagonists or DORAs, which work by blocking chemical messengers called orexins. Orexins are responsible for keeping people awake. Levels of this compound rise during the day and fall at night. Orexins originate in a specific region of the hypothalamus, so targeting them may have less impact on other brain functions, Renger said. For this study, the team wanted to find out what would happen if someone is awakened on this drug and has a very high level of it in their system. “How impaired would they be?” Renger said. To test this, the researchers did a series of experiments on rhesus monkeys and rats. First, the team trained monkeys to perform a common attention test in which they needed to respond quickly to a blinking light on a screen and remember what they touched. Monkeys given GABA inhibitors were much slower in responding to the prompt, and in some cases, missed it altogether, while monkeys given a potent orexin blocker called DORA-22 did not show these attention issues, Renger said. The team also saw differences in a simple memory test in rats. Rats were first exposed to a colored object, and then later exposed to it again. Typically, rats that recall an object show less interest in it when they are shown it again. In the study, rats given GABA blockers were less likely to recall the objects than those given DORA-22. Emmanuel Mignot of Stanford University, who wrote a commentary on the study in the same journal, said the findings show promise. “Are DORAs the perfect hypnotics? Only long-term use in large numbers of insomnia patients will reveal whether these drugs will be preferred to GABAergic hypnotics, and whether they produce rare complications, including narcolepsy-like symptoms in predisposed individuals,” Mignot wrote. So far, Merck has not seen any cases of narcolepsy, a sleep disorder marked by daytime sleepiness, in its late-stage clinical trials, Renger said. The most common side effects from Suvorexant have been headache and sleepiness. No serious drug-related side effects have been reported.

The Pfizer medicine belongs to a new class of diabetes treatments called SGLT2 inhibitors. Now nearing Phase III late-stage trials, it is behind similar drugs in development — including Johnson & Johnson’s Invokana (canagliflozin) which was approved by U.S. regulators in late March. Under their partnership, Merck and Pfizer will collaborate on development and marketing of ertugliflozin as well as on tablets that pair it with Januvia and the widely used oral treatment metformin. Januvia is the leading member of another class of diabetes drugs called DPP-4 inhibitors. It is also sold in combination with another type of drug called metformin, under the brand name Janumet. The Januvia/Janumet tablets have annual sales of $5.75 billion, making them Merck’s biggest products. Richard Purkiss, an analyst with Atlantic Equities, said little is yet known about the Pfizer drug, but he said both companies stand to gain by developing it together. “If you add Pfizer’s drug to Januvia — Merck’s leading DPP4-inhibitor — that would extend the Januvia franchise even further and help Merck,” Purkiss said. “And the beauty of this from Pfizer’s perspective is they will be piggybacking on Merck’s (Januvia) franchise and are also getting a contribution from Merck for the Phase 3 program,” Purkiss said. Pfizer has so far received $60 million in upfront and milestone payments from Merck under the ertugliflozin partnership and will be eligible for additional payments associated with clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones. Merck and Pfizer will share potential revenue and certain costs on a 60/40 percent basis, the U.S. companies said. Merck will continue to retain the rights to its existing portfolio of Januvia-containing products.

331,MRK,"Merck's Januvia diabetes drug lags, 2013 forecast cut","(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) reported a surprising drop in quarterly sales of diabetes medicine Januvia, its biggest product and a frequent driver of quarterly earnings, and the drugmaker cut its full-year profit forecast on Wednesday. Shares of Merck (MRK.N) fell 1.6 percent to $46.23. Although its profit beat forecasts for the quarter, this was due largely to a favorable tax rate, and investors were concerned about slower growth for Januvia and whether Merck could bring promising new drugs to market soon. “This was an inflection point for Januvia,” said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover. “The drug is maturing and will see significant but slower growth over the next few years as the market gets more competitive.” In lowering its profit outlook, Merck cited “pressures on sales that are greater than previously anticipated,” including the stronger dollar, new research programs and higher taxes. “The weakness of Merck’s quarter can only be regarded as a clarion call for management and investors,” Citibank analyst Andrew Baum said in a research note. He said Merck must manage costs, its drug portfolio and investors’ expectations more carefully. Merck reported first-quarter net income of $1.59 billion, or 52 cents per share, compared with $1.74 billion, or 56 cents per share, in the year-earlier period, when it took $1.6 billion in acquisition and restructuring charges. Excluding these and other special items in the latest quarter, Merck earned 85 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting 79 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales fell 9 percent to $10.7 billion, below the $11.09 billion Wall Street was expecting. Sales of Januvia, the company’s fastest-growing medicine since it was approved in 2006, fell 4 percent to $884 million. Sales of Janumet, a pill which combines Januvia with the diabetes treatment metformin, rose 4 percent to $409 million. Combined sales of the medicines fell 1 percent to $1.3 billion. By contrast, both drugs had sales gains of more than 15 percent in the prior quarter. Merck said their combined sales fell 5 percent in the United States, where about $70 million worth of wholesaler inventories of Januvia were drawn down to a two-year low, thereby lessening the need for purchases. The company said Januvia’s U.S. sales this year would grow at a mid-single-digit percentage range and increase in the low double digits in the rest of the world. STOCK BUYBACK ‘BAND-AID’ Merck said its board had authorized additional purchases of up to $15 billion of its common stock and that it would buy back about $7.5 billion over the next 12 months. “The $15 billion share repurchase program announcement is a positive for investors, but doesn’t address poor recent research and development productivity and may be viewed as a temporary Band-Aid to cover a worrying decline in the growth of Januvia,” Jefferies & Co analyst Jeffrey Holford said. The company said it expected full-year earnings of $3.45 to $3.55 per share, excluding special items. That is below the $3.60 to $3.70 it had forecast in February. Despite the challenges, Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Frazier said Merck’s fundamentals remained strong. “We think the second half of this year will be a better indicator of the strength of our business,” he said on a conference call with analysts. Sales of asthma drug Singulair plunged 75 percent to $337 million in the quarter. The pill was Merck’s biggest product, with annual sales of $6 billion, before cheaper generics flooded the U.S. market last August. More pain from generics is in store. Merck’s Maxalt migraine drug recently lost patent protection and its Temodar brain cancer medicine will soon face cheaper copycats. Merck aims to seek marketing approval this year for a handful of new drugs, including a sleep aid called suvorexant now before U.S. regulators. It is counting on these products to help offset plunging sales of Singulair, Maxalt and Temodar. But success of the drugs is far from assured, and Merck has had several disappointments in recent months. In January, a cholesterol fighter called Tredaptive failed to prevent heart problems in clinical trials and raised safety concerns. It was recalled in Europe following those findings. The following month, Merck said it would delay until next year a U.S. marketing application for osteoporosis treatment odanacatib. Merck’s animal health business posted sales of $840 million, a 2 percent gain, while sales of the company’s array of consumer care products rose 3 percent to $571 million.

332,MRK,"UPDATE 3-Merck's Januvia diabetes drug lags, 2013 forecast cut","By Ransdell Pierson May 1 (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc reported a surprising drop in quarterly sales of diabetes medicine Januvia, its biggest product and a frequent driver of quarterly earnings, and the drugmaker cut its full-year profit forecast on Wednesday. Shares of Merck fell 1.6 percent to $46.23. Although its profit beat forecasts for the quarter, this was due largely to a favorable tax rate, and investors were concerned about slower growth for Januvia and whether Merck could bring promising new drugs to market soon. “This was an inflection point for Januvia,” said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover. “The drug is maturing and will see significant but slower growth over the next few years as the market gets more competitive.” In lowering its profit outlook, Merck cited “pressures on sales that are greater than previously anticipated,” including the stronger dollar, new research programs and higher taxes. “The weakness of Merck’s quarter can only be regarded as a clarion call for management and investors,” Citibank analyst Andrew Baum said in a research note. He said Merck must manage costs, its drug portfolio and investors’ expectations more carefully. Merck reported first-quarter net income of $1.59 billion, or 52 cents per share, compared with $1.74 billion, or 56 cents per share, in the year-earlier period, when it took $1.6 billion in acquisition and restructuring charges. Excluding these and other special items in the latest quarter, Merck earned 85 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting 79 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales fell 9 percent to $10.7 billion, below the $11.09 billion Wall Street was expecting. Sales of Januvia, the company’s fastest-growing medicine since it was approved in 2006, fell 4 percent to $884 million. Sales of Janumet, a pill which combines Januvia with the diabetes treatment metformin, rose 4 percent to $409 million. Combined sales of the medicines fell 1 percent to $1.3 billion. By contrast, both drugs had sales gains of more than 15 percent in the prior quarter. Merck said their combined sales fell 5 percent in the United States, where about $70 million worth of wholesaler inventories of Januvia were drawn down to a two-year low, thereby lessening the need for purchases. The company said Januvia’s U.S. sales this year would grow at a mid-single-digit percentage range and increase in the low double digits in the rest of the world.

Disappointing results from companies including MasterCard  and Merck were also weighing on the market. Merck was the biggest decliner on the blue chip Dow index. U.S. private employers added 119,000 jobs in April, well below economists’ expectations, in the latest piece of data to suggest the economy is encountering a soft patch. Adding to signs the economy cooled as the second quarter got under way, a separate report showed the pace of U.S. manufacturing growth slowed in April as the sector expanded only modestly. “We have weak ADP, weak ISM and probably less bullish tone on the state of the economy from the Fed later. Basically, we’ve had six weeks of weakening data but I think this may be a speed bump rather than a trend,” said Jack De Gan, chief investment officer of Harbor Advisory. “If we can overcome this by the end of the day, we are breaking out of an old high and heading into a new (territory).” The U.S. Federal Reserve, which is holding a two-day policy meeting, announces its latest decision at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) and the European Central Bank follows on Thursday.

U.S. stock index futures cut modest gains to trade negative following a jobs report that showed U.S. private employers added 119,000 jobs in April, well below economists’ expectations, in the latest piece of data to suggest the economy is encountering a soft patch. “Overall the employment report suggests the pace of economic growth is ticking over below par at this stage, something corroborated by weakening demand from the euro zone,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak & Co in New York. In earnings, Merck & Co Inc reported lower-than-expected first quarter sales, as generic competition hurt demand for its Singulair asthma drug and the stronger dollar hit overseas sales. The stock was down 5.1 percent in premarket trade.

Dow Jones industrial average futures lost 23 points while Nasdaq 100 futures added 2 points. “The Fed will be the key today. I expect them to acknowledge that the economy has slowed down, and if anything, that will reinforce the notion that the Fed stimulus will be around till the end of the year,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York. The S&P; 500 closed out its sixth straight month of gains, its longest winning streak since September 2009, with investors using any pullback as a buying opportunity. The benchmark index hit a new intraday high in the last minutes of trading on Tuesday, following a session in which moves were slight as investors found few reasons to extend recent gains. In focus is the 1,600 level on the S&P; 500 Index. “We got back to 1,596 yesterday, so I think the psychological resistance is still in place,” said Bryan Sapp, senior trading analyst at Schaeffer’s Investment Research.

338,MRK,FDA approves Merck combination cholesterol lowering pill,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a Merck & Co cholesterol lowering pill that combines a generic version of Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor with its own Zetia, Merck said on Friday. The new combination drug will be sold under the brand name Liptruzet and will begin shipping to wholesalers next week, the company said. Merck already sells a two-drug cholesterol fighter called Vytorin that combines Zetia, known chemically as ezetimibe, with Merck’s older LDL lowering medicine Zocor. Lipitor, known chemically as atorvastatin, is considered to a more powerful statin than Zocor. Vytorin, which had sales of $1.75 billion in 2012, is currently undergoing a long-term trial to prove that it can reduce heart attacks and strokes better than Zocor (simvastatin) alone. While results of that study should definitively determine the value of Zetia to patients, the drug on its own rang up sales of $2.67 billion in 2012. “No incremental benefit of Liptruzet on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality over and above that demonstrated for atorvastatin has been established,” Merck said. The new drug will be available in four doses, combining 10 milligrams of Zetia with either 10, 20, 40 or 80mg of atorvastatin.

(MRK.N) filed a more than $100 million sex discrimination lawsuit against the drugmaker on Thursday, claiming that it particularly discriminates against pregnant employees and women with children. The plaintiff, Kelli Smith, in a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey, claims she was demoted for taking maternity leave in 2010, and penalized by unfair performance evaluations and other actions that stalled her career and hurt her reputation. The lawsuit, which seeks class-action status, alleges the No. 2 U.S. drugmaker engages in “systematic, companywide discriminatory treatment of its female employees on the basis of their gender and their taking federal and state-protected pregnancy leave.” Smith is described in the lawsuit as a senior sales rep in Merck’s Toms River, New Jersey, district, who has been a top performer in terms of sales. Smith was hired by Merck in 2004. Merck officials could not be reached immediately for comment. The lawsuit claims that Merck’s companywide sales incentive plan “provides that the compensation of managers and directors is decreased when their employees take legally protected leave. ... Through this centralized policy, Merck discourages management from hiring and promoting women.” Smith is represented by the law firm of Sanford Heisler, which won a May 2010 lawsuit that made similar claims against Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG NOVN.VX. Novartis was ordered to pay $250 million in punitive damages after a federal jury in Manhattan found the company had discriminated against thousands of female sales reps in terms of pay, promotions and pregnancy policies. Following subsequent negotiations, Novartis reached a final settlement that provided $175 million to its 6,200 affected female employees.

The advisory panel was convened to help the FDA decide whether to approve the drug, suvorexant, which would be the first in a new class of sedatives designed to help people fall asleep and stay asleep. On Monday, the FDA’s internal reviewers published a report expressing concern about the drug’s potential to cause next-day sleepiness and impaired driving. They asked the committee to consider whether patients should be started at a lower dose than that recommended by Merck. Merck proposed that elderly patients start by taking 15 milligrams of the drug and increase that to 30 if necessary. The company recommended non-elderly adults start on 20 milligrams and increase it to 40 milligrams if needed. On Wednesday, the FDA reiterated its opinion that there was little evidence in Merck’s data to show that the higher dose was more effective than the lower dose, and considerable evidence to show it was less safe. The FDA’s reviewers pointed to an increase in the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, an increased risk of impaired driving, and an increased risk of severe sleep disturbances. Speaking for the FDA, Dr. Ronald Farkas noted cases in which patients had reported sleep paralysis and terrifying hallucinations. He also expressed the agency’s concern about the drug’s impact on driving. “What we are trying to prevent is criminal prosecution of patients taking their drug as prescribed,” he said. Merck celebrated the panel’s recommendation, saying in a statement that it was “excited about the potential of suvorexant as a new and different approach to treating insomnia.” The FDA is not bound to follow the advice of its advisory panels but typically does so. The FDA had asked the panel to consider whether patients should start with a 10 milligram dose, saying data from a smaller trial showed that amount might work for some people. Merck disputed that, saying 10 milligrams would not be effective. The FDA asked the panel if Merck should conduct an additional trial to further evaluate a 10 milligram dose. The panel voted against that. Some panelists agreed with Merck that 10 milligrams would not be effective. Others agreed in principal with a lower starting dose, but said a new trial would not add meaningfully to the information already in hand. The panel voted 13-3, with one abstention, that the drug is safe for elderly patients at 15 milligrams a day and for non-elderly adults at 20 milligrams.

The advisory panel was convened to help the U.S. Food and Drug Administration decide whether to approve the drug, suvorexant, which would be the first in a new class of sedatives that block chemicals in the brain called orexins that help keep people awake. The drugs are designed to help people fall asleep and stay asleep. On Monday, the FDA’s internal reviewers published a report expressing concern about suvorexant’s potential to cause next-day sleepiness and impaired driving.

On Wednesday, the FDA reiterated its opinion that there was little evidence in Merck’s data to show that the higher dose was more effective than the lower dose, and considerable evidence to show it was less safe. The FDA’s reviewers pointed to an increase in the risk - especially at the higher doses - of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, impaired driving, and severe sleep disturbances. Speaking for the FDA, Dr. Ronald Farkas noted cases in which patients had reported sleep paralysis and terrifying hallucinations. He also expressed the agency’s concern about the drug’s impact on driving. “What we are trying to prevent is criminal prosecution of patients taking their drug as prescribed,” he said. The FDA’s views were echoed by those of several patient advocacy groups. “Like its predecessors, suvorexant’s marginal benefit in extending overnight sleep time by a few minutes is achieved at the expense of prolonged, next-day drowsiness, with potentially fatal consequences,” said Dr. Sammy Almashat, a researcher with Public Citizen’s Health Research Group who noted that suvorexant stays in the body longer than all but one other sleep drug. Still, the panel voted 13 to 3, with one abstention, that the drug could be used safely at the 15 and 20 milligram doses. It voted 8-7, with two abstentions, that the drug is not safe at 30 and 40 milligrams. Merck celebrated the vote, saying in a statement that it was “excited about the potential of suvorexant as a new and different approach to treating insomnia.” The FDA is not bound to follow the advice of its advisory panels but typically does so.

The panel voted against that. Some agreed that 10 milligrams would not be effective. Others agreed in principal with a lower starting dose, but most said a new trial would not add meaningfully to the information already in hand. “When you have something new you don’t know everything you would like to know,” said Dr. Christian Guilleminault, a professor at Stanford University School of Medicine. However, he added: “I’m not sure that doing another study is going to bring us much more.” The FDA’s concerns come amid a broader review of the safety of sleeping pills following hundreds of reports of driving accidents involving people taking zolpidem, the active ingredient in Sanofi SA’s Ambien. About 60 million prescriptions for these drugs were written in the United States in 2011, according to healthcare research firm I.M.S. Of those, roughly 40 million contained zolpidem. In January, the FDA told drugmakers they should lower the recommended dose of zolpidem in women to 5 milligrams from 10 for immediate-release products including Ambien, Edluar and Zolpimist. The agency said doses for extended-release products should also be cut in half. Dr. Jason Todd, a panel member and staff neurologist at NorthEast Neurology in Concord, North Carolina, said patients are adjusting to the lower dosing recommendations for Ambien. “Before the recent changes I almost never saw a patient who would take 5 milligrams and stay with it,” he said. “Now that 5 milligrams is recommended people are OK with 5 milligrams.” The panel’s ultimate recommendation surprised some analysts who had expected, based on the FDA’s review, that the meeting would be more contentious. “Based on the overall discussion today and the voting of the panel, we believe that the probability of FDA approval for suvorexant has gone up meaningfully,” Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst at ISI Group, said in a research note. Having said that, he said: “We admit that predicting a final FDA decision is difficult.”",5232013,http://www.reuters.com/article/fda-merck/update-2-mercks-insomnia-drug-moves-a-step-closer-to-u-s-approval-idUSL2N0E32HW20130523
346,MRK,UPDATE 1-Merck melanoma drug shrinks tumors in 38 percent of patients,"* Among those who got the highest dose, 52 percent responded * Company to start phase-three trial in third quarter By Julie Steenhuysen CHICAGO, June 2 (Reuters) - A Merck & Co drug designed to unmask tumor cells and mobilize the immune system into fighting cancer helped shrink tumors in 38 percent of patients with advanced melanoma in an early-stage study, U.S. researchers said on Sunday. Based on the findings about the drug lambrolizumab, published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago, Merck says it will move directly into a late-stage clinical trial, which will start in the third quarter. “This is a top priority at Merck,” Dr. Gary Gilliand, senior vice present and head of oncology at Merck Research Laboratories said in a meeting with investors. “We’re going flat out to deliver benefit to patients with this novel mechanism.” The moves may heap pressure on market leader Bristol-Myers Squibb, maker of Yervoy - the only approved immune system drug for the treatment of advanced melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. Bristol-Myers is conducting three phase-three studies of its own drug called nivolumab in advanced melanoma, and is studying the drug’s effect on a range of other cancers, including lung cancer. Both nivolumab and lambrolizumab are part of a promising new class of drugs that disable programmed death 1 or PD-1, a protein that keeps the immune system from spotting and attacking cancer cells. “Even though it’s (lambrolizumab) the second player in the field and even though it’s all early, it impressed me,” said Dr. Antoni Ribas of the University of California Los Angeles’ Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, the lead author of the study. Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration deemed the treatment a “breakthrough therapy,” a designation FDA cancer drugs chief Dr. Richard Pazdur described as “knock-your-socks-off therapies.” Results of an early-stage study of nivolumab in advanced melanoma released at the cancer meeting showed 31 percent of patients overall responded to different doses of the drug. Among those who took the 3 milligram per kilogram dose, 41 percent of patients responded. The drug response lasted an average of two years, and in many patients the drug kept working even after they stopped taking it. Analysts expect the drugs to generate billions of dollars in sales. Nivolumab alone is forecast to have sales of $1.2 billion in 2017, according to Wall Street analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters Pharma. Merck’s results are from the first clinical trial of lambrolizumab in advanced melanoma. They are based on analysis of 135 patients with metastatic melanoma who were divided into three groups with different treatment regimens. Overall, lambrolizumab resulted in 38 percent of patients having confirmed improvement of their cancer across all dose levels given after 12 weeks of treatment. But there was a wide range among doses, with only a 25 percent rate among patients who got the lowest dose and 52 percent among those who got the highest dose. In the highest dose group, 10 percent had a complete response, meaning their tumors could not be detected on scans. Side effects were generally mild and included fatigue, fevers, skin rash, loss of skin color and muscle weakness. More severe side effects were seen in 13 percent of patients, including inflammation of the lung or kidney and thyroid problems. “This study is showing the highest rate of durable melanoma responses of any drug we have tested thus far in this cancer, and it is doing it without serious side effects in the great majority of patients,” Ribas said. Merck said it plans to start a late-stage randomized trial of the drug in melanoma and in non-small cell lung cancer in the third quarter of this year. The company recently started a global, randomized mid-stage study of the drug versus standard chemotherapy in patients whose disease had progressed. And it is studying the drug as a treatment for triple negative breast, metastatic bladder and head and neck cancers. Researchers at the meeting marveled at responses to new immune system treatments after decades of failed studies among patients with melanoma. Only about one in five patients respond to Yervoy, approved in 2011 as the first immunotherapy to extend survival in patients with advanced melanoma. Yervoy works by blocking CTLA-4, a different molecule that also keeps the immune system from attacking cancer. Ribas said he has followed one patient on Yervoy for 12 years now. “She’s not supposed to be around, and she’s alive and well and melanoma free. That is why we’ve been doing these immunotherapies,” he said. With Yervoy, Ribas said these types of responses were few and far between. With the new PD-1 drugs, they are much more common, with fewer side effects. However, an early-stage Bristol-Myers’ study released this month showed that 53 percent of patients who got a combination of Yervoy and nivolumab had at least a 50 percent reduction in tumor size, with fewer side effects. Tim Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation, said combination treatments would make a major difference for patients because they help overcome cancer’s “sneaky” ability to evade treatment. But, at this point, he said, “Nobody knows which one is better.”",6022013,http://www.reuters.com/article/health-cancer-melanoma-merck/update-1-merck-melanoma-drug-shrinks-tumors-in-38-percent-of-patients-idUSL1N0EE04T20130602
347,MRK,"Exclusive: EU to fine Lundbeck, others for blocking generic drugs","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A European regulator will fine Denmark’s Lundbeck and eight other makers of generic drugs for limiting the supply of cheaper medicines, two people with knowledge of the matter said, its first sanction against “pay-for-delay” deals. Following an inquiry launched in 2009, the European Union’s anti-trust regulator will impose a “significant” fine on Lundbeck and lesser fines on Germany’s Merck KGaA this month, the people said. Seven smaller drug firms will also be fined. The sanctions underscore the determination of EU and U.S. regulators to break agreements that involve brand-name drug companies paying generic manufacturers not to deliver cheaper versions of their drugs to the market, a practice that ultimately harms consumers. European regulators have estimated that consumers are paying up to 20 percent more for medicines in some cases. Generic versions typically cost a fraction of the price of original medicines in Western markets. The pharmaceutical industry will be looking for guidance from the case as to what is lawful and what is not, said Koen Platteau, a partner at Brussels-based law firm Olswang. “The Commission clearly wants to send out a message that in circumstances, this kind of agreement can be restrictive. This is the first case where they will set a precedent,” he said. The European Commission, the EU’s antitrust regulator, can fine a company up to 10 percent of its global revenue for breaching competition laws. In the case of Lundbeck, which makes an anti-depressant drug and a treatment for Alzheimer’s, that would be up to 240 million euros ($311.04 million). The people Reuters spoke to did not give the precise size of the fines. “The fine for Lundbeck is expected to be significant, less so for the others,” said one of the people, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. Lundbeck paid the generics firms to keep its products from the market and bought stocks of the generic anti-depressant drug citalopram to be destroyed, the person said. A spokesman for Lundbeck said the company had not been notified of any fine and believed it had done nothing wrong. Lundbeck shares fell 1.9 percent after Reuters reported the fine. They were trading 1.4 percent lower at 109.2 crowns by 11:16 a.m. EDT. The other companies to be fined are Generics UK, Arrow, Resolution Chemicals, Xellia Pharmaceuticals, Alpharma, A.L. Industrier and India’s No. 1 pharmaceutical company Ranbaxy, all of them makers of generic drugs. Ranbaxy declined to comment. A Merck KGaA spokeswoman said the company, which sold subsidiary Generics UK to U.S. generic drugmaker Mylan in 2007, does not comment on pending legal issues. Antoine Colombani, the spokesman for competition policy at the Commission, declined to comment. The EU competition authority has two similar cases in the pipeline, involving Israel’s Teva, French drugmaker Servier, Johnson & Johnson and Novartis. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has battled against such deals in court for more than a decade. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to decide on the issue by the end of the month after lower courts issued conflicting rulings. Brand name companies have defended “pay-for-delay” deals in large part to protect patents and avoid costly litigation. In a typical case, a generic rival may challenge the patent of a brand-name competitor, which then pays the rival a sum of money to drop its challenge. Defenders of the practice call it a legitimate means to resolve patent litigation.

355,MRK,"FDA rejects Merck insomnia drug, seeks lower-dose","(Reuters) - U.S. health regulators have rejected Merck & Co’s new insomnia drug application but opened the door to approving a lower-dose version of the medication, the company said on Monday. Merck said it received a complete response letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration saying that the agency could consider a 10 milligram starting dose of suvorexant for most patients, but that the company would have to have that dosage ready before it could be approved. The FDA in its letter said 15 mg and 20 mg doses would be appropriate in patients in whom the 10 mg dose is well-tolerated but not effective, Merck said. ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said the manufacturing study could lead to about a one-year delay in approval, especially if the FDA asks for long-term stability testing of the lower dose version. Merck declined to discuss the timeline or potential length of delay as a result of the FDA response. Merck had proposed that elderly patients start by taking 15 milligrams of the drug and increase that to 30 if necessary, and had recommended that non-elderly adults start on 20 milligrams and increase to 40 milligrams if needed. In its letter, the FDA determined that doses of 30 mg and 40 mg were not safe for approval, Merck said on Monday. Merck said it doesn’t see the need for further clinical studies to move forward with a 10 mg dose, but would require manufacturing studies to move ahead. Such manufacturing studies typically involve development of standard manufacturing and operational procedures to demonstrate that the pill can be manufactured in a stable and reproducible form. It could also require demonstrating that the medicine has a durable shelf life. “We know how to do this. We do this all the time,” Merck spokesman Steven Cragle said. ISI’s Schoenebaum, who forecast annual suvorexant sales of $700 million by 2018, in a research note estimated a modest impact to Merck from the delay, and found a silver lining in that “suvorexant at 15 mg and 20 mg doses appears to the FDA to be approvable.” He said a one-year delay lowers ISI’s 2018 Merck EPS estimate by only 0.25 percent to 0.6 percent. Merck also said it will discuss with the FDA whether additional studies will be required to support a 5 mg dose for certain patients. Suvorexant belongs to a new class of insomnia medicines called orexin receptor antagonists and would be the first such medicine on the market if approved. It is designed to facilitate sleep by blocking neurotransmitters in the brain that help to keep a person awake.

The move follows a separate probe into instant milk powder, which has already led to price cuts. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) is surveying production costs and prices charged at multiple foreign and Chinese drug companies, according to a July 2 statement from the commission. News of the investigation was reported earlier on Thursday by the official Securities Daily newspaper. The NDRC will examine 27 companies on cost issues and 33 for pricing. The investigation is being done to understand the cost and pricing situation within the companies, and to adjust drug prices in a timely manner, the agency said. In addition to GSK and Merck, other foreign companies being investigated over costs include Astellas, Novartis’s generics unit Sandoz, Boehringer Ingelheim, Baxter International and Fresenius. An investigation team from NDRC will visit the companies involved between July and October, the agency said. One industry source familiar with the situation said the probe appeared to be focused on so-called transfer pricing, which determines how costs are distributed between units of large companies. Beijing plans to analyze the difference in prices of imported products sold by foreign firms in China compared with those in other markets. The NDRC has also been investigating potential price-fixing and anti-competitive behavior by five instant milk powder makers, including Swiss food company Nestle and French rival Danone. In response, Nestle and Danone said on Wednesday they were cutting the price of infant formula milk in China. The NDRC probe into GlaxoSmithKline comes as high-level Chinese staff at the firm are being investigated by police in a separate case in the south-central Chinese city of Changsha on suspicion of economic crimes. Changsha police have not provided any further details about the investigation and a GSK spokesman in London said it remained unclear what the investigation was about.

However, GSK said it had investigated the allegations thoroughly and found no evidence of any wrongdoing. It is not clear if the Changsha police investigation is related to these bribery allegations. China is an increasingly important market for international pharmaceutical companies, which are relying on growth in emerging markets to offset slower sales in Western markets where many former blockbuster drugs have lost patent protection.

360,MRK,UPDATE 3-Merck drug to reverse anesthesia delayed again at FDA,"By Toni Clarke WASHINGTON, July 16 (Reuters) - U.S. health regulators need more time to review Merck & Co’s application to sell sugammadex, an injection designed to reverse the effects of muscle relaxants used during surgery, the company said on Tuesday. The announcement came after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration canceled a meeting of outside advisers who were scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to recommend the drug be approved. The FDA declined to give an explanation for its unusual last-minute cancellation. Merck said the FDA needs additional time to assess the results of its recently completed inspection of a clinical trial site that was involved in a study of whether the drug increases the risk of allergic reactions. In 2008 the FDA declined to approve sugammadex, citing concerns about its possible association with allergic reactions and bleeding. The advisory panel scheduled for this week was supposed to discuss Merck’s revised application, which included new clinical data showing a slight increase in the risk of allergic reactions but no increase the risk of bleeding. The study was conducted in the United States, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Germany. The sudden delay surprised analysts and clinicians alike. “I’m surprised to hear about this last-minute issue,” said Dr. Glenn Murphy, an anesthesiologist and director of clinical research at North Shore University Health System in Evanston, Illinois, who was an adviser to Merck on sugammadex. “I thought everything was moving along towards getting this drug approved.” Sugammadex is already approved in more than 50 countries, where it is sold under the brand name Bridion. It generated worldwide sales of $261 million in 2012. Analysts on average forecast U.S. sales of sugammadex, if approved, to reach $663 million annually by 2018, according to Reuters data. It would compete with Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc’s Prostigmin, known generically as neostigmine, and Tensilon, also known as edrophonium. “Given the success it’s had outside the United States and the clinical data I’ve seen, I’m optimistic,” said Damien Conover, an analyst at Morningstar. Muscle relaxants are typically used as part of the anesthesia process at the beginning of an operation to help doctors insert a breathing tube. They can also be used during surgery to prevent muscle movements that could complicate a procedure. After surgery physicians use reversal agents to undo the effects of these muscle relaxants so that patients can breathe, eat and swallow on their own. Sugammadex is the first in a new class of drugs designed to reverse the effect of the muscle relaxants rocuronium and vecuronium. Sugammadex’s path toward approval has been far from smooth. The product was originally developed by Organon BioSciences, which was acquired by Schering-Plough in 2007 for $14.4 billion. Merck acquired the drug when it bought Schering-Plough for $41 billion in 2009. Organon also developed Raplon, a muscle relaxant that was withdrawn from the U.S. market in 2001 after being associated with fatal episodes of airway constriction known as bronchospasms. In March, the FDA said it would not complete its review of sugammadex until Merck provided more clinical data on allergic reactions, though Merck said at the time it had completed the necessary trials and that the FDA had accepted its resubmitted marketing application. The delay is the latest in a number of setbacks for Merck, coming just two weeks after the FDA rejected the company’s insomnia drug suvorexant, though it left the door open for the company to submit a lower-dose version for approval. In February Merck said it would delay its marketing application for odanacatib, an experimental osteoporosis drug, and in March it replaced its research chief. Merck said it is “engaged in discussions with the FDA” to identify the steps necessary to enable the agency to complete its review of sugammadex, which the company believes offers significant advantages over its competitors, particularly in the speed with which it takes effect. Patients taking sugammadex to reverse deep paralysis caused by rocuronium emerged, on average, in 2.2 minutes, according to pooled data from late-stage clinical trials conducted by Merck and submitted to the FDA. Patients taking neostigmine emerged in 19 minutes, while those taking a placebo emerged in 92.9 minutes. In patients given sugammadex to reverse the effects of vecuronium, patients emerged in 3.8 minutes on average compared with 67.6 minutes for those taking neostigmine, the company said. David Michelson, Merck’s head of neuroscientific research, said that in a trial of 448 patients who received 16 milligrams of sugammadex per kilogram of body weight - an amount given only on an emergency basis - one patient experienced a clear anaphylactic reaction, characterized by a drop in blood pressure, hives, increased heart rate and difficulty breathing. Two other patients had reactions that were not clearly anaphylactic but shared some symptoms, while seven or eight more had milder allergic reactions such as nausea and rash, he said. In patients taking the normal dose used in routine surgeries - 4 milligrams per 1 kilogram of body weight - there were no clearly anaphylactic reactions and only one mild reaction, Michelson said, adding that in a trial of nearly 1,200 patients undergoing hip or knee surgery, those who were given sugammadex were no more likely than those who were not given it to have episodes of bleeding.

363,MRK,FDA accepts review of long-delayed Merck blood clot drug,"(Adds Merck comment, share movement) By Ransdell Pierson July 24 - Merck & Co. on Wednesday said U.S. regulators had accepted its marketing application for the blood clot drug vorapaxar, aimed at preventing heart attacks and strokes in patients who have already had a heart attack but who have no history of stroke. The experimental drug, acquired by Merck through its 2009 acquisition of rival U.S. drugmaker Schering-Plough Corp., was once considered a potential blockbuster product. But its prospects wilted in 2011 when a safety committee overseeing a 26,000-patient study, called TRA-2P, said the new type of anti-platelet drug was not appropriate for patients who had already suffered a stroke because the drug raised bleeding risk. Merck was allowed to press ahead with the trial, one of the largest heart-drug studies ever conducted, among patients who were in stable condition after having heart attacks or being diagnosed with clogged leg arteries. Patients who had suffered strokes were excluded from the trial. The study’s aim was to see if vorapaxar could prevent heart attack and stroke in that more-limited patient population and whether it could do so safely, given the drug’s established bleeding risk. Despite mixed results of the now-completed trial and the drug’s failure in a separate earlier study called TRACER, Merck last summer said it would seek approval of vorapaxar. “Despite the use of standard therapy, there continues to be residual risk of additional heart attacks in these patients,” Merck spokeswoman Pam Eisele said on Wednesday, citing the need for new drugs like vorapaxar, which works through a different mechanism than existing medicines. But some analysts have cautioned that even if approved, it would likely be used by a limited number of patients because of the bleeding risk.

366,MRK,"Cost controls help Pfizer, Merck weather weak quarter","(Reuters) - Big Pharma is still relying on belt-tightening to prop up financial results. Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Merck & Co (MRK.N) said on Tuesday their quarterly results were again hit by generic competition for once top-selling products and the toll of a strong dollar on overseas revenue. Controls on marketing and administrative expenses, and other costs, helped them report earnings slightly above Wall Street estimates. But neither company offered investors a quick return to growth based on new products, even if the worst of the “patent cliff” for best-selling drugs that have lost marketing exclusivity is behind them. “We are managing our costs in order for us to meet our bottom line (earnings) guidance,” Chief Executive Kenneth Frazier said on a conference call with analysts. Frazier said the company continues to have faith in the value of its animal health unit and consumer healthcare business, both of which had lower sales in the quarter. “If we were to view these assets as being more productive outside the company, we would consider other alternatives,” he said. Pfizer earlier this year completed the spinoff of its own animal health business into a new company called Zoetis (ZTS.N), only months after selling off its nutritional products business. It aims to return billions of dollars in proceeds to investors through stock repurchases and higher dividends. But, like Merck, it is holding on for now to its consumer healthcare unit. Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read said the industry’s best hope is a crop of new drugs and vaccines now in clinical trials that could transform treatment for cancer, cardiovascular diseases and other ailments. “Certainly in the second half of this decade, I foresee significant products coming to market which will be a catalyst for industrial growth,” he said in an interview. The strength of the dollar, particularly against the Japanese yen, has hurt sales of many U.S. companies with extensive international business this year. Merck said full-year sales were likely to be about 5 to 6 percent below last year’s levels, Even so, it stuck to its full-year profit outlook of $3.45 to $3.55 per share, excluding special items. Pfizer, the largest U.S. drugmaker, said second quarter revenue fell 7 percent to $12.97 billion, with 3 percent of the decline due to an unfavorable foreign exchange rate. But Pfizer also trimmed costs and expenses by 3 percent and reiterated its full-year earnings forecast of $2.10 to $2.20 per share. Pfizer said income, excluding special items, fell 10 percent to $4 billion, or 56 cents a share, from $4.45 billion, or 59 cents a share, a year earlier. Merck earned $906 million, or 30 cents per share, down from $1.79 billion, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, Merck earned 84 cents a share. “It follows along with the bigger picture in healthcare where things are OK. They’re not horrible, but they’re not great either,” said Michael Liss, portfolio manager at American Century Investments. Liss predicted that the next big catalyst for the industry would come when U.S. healthcare reform kicks into high gear next year, helping millions more Americans get insurance coverage for doctor’s visits and medications. “People are just waiting to get insurance and then spending will pick up,” Liss predicted. “The rate of growth will improve. It’s going to come from people having insurance.” But Pfizer’s Read said the company does not expect the Affordable Care Act to significantly bolster its sales or earnings. “Most of those are younger and healthy patients, so we see no near-term impact on our business,” he said in an interview. Pfizer’s results were hurt by generic competition for its cholesterol fighter Lipitor, formerly the world’s top selling medicine. Lipitor sales fell 55 percent $545 million, while Merck saw sales of its off-patent asthma drug Singulair plunge 80 percent to $281 million. Pfizer shares closed down 13 cents at $29.67, while Merck fell 29 cents to $48.05 on the New York Stock Exchange. Pfizer on Monday announced plans to internally separate its commercial operations into two units for branded products and a third for generics, leading to speculation that it was looking to split up the company. Chief Financial Officer Frank D’Amelio told analysts on a conference call on Tuesday that Pfizer would need at least three years to consider whether to break up the company, and that the reorganization was essentially a test drive to more closely examine their respective operations. “This is all about getting the three businesses to hum internally,” he said.

373,MRK,UPDATE 1-U.S. FDA approves GlaxoSmithKline's HIV drug Tivicay,"WASHINGTON, Aug 12 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Monday it has approved GlaxoSmithKline Plc’s drug Tivicay to treat the most common strain of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. The once-daily drug, known generically as dolutegravir, belongs to a novel class known as integrase inhibitors that block the virus from entering cells. Tivicay is owned by ViiV Healthcare, an HIV joint venture between GSK, Pfizer Inc and Shionogi & Co Ltd  in which GSK is the largest shareholder, with a 76.5 percent stake. Analysts on average expect sales of the drug to reach about $900 million by 2017, according to six analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Tivicay can be used to treat infected adults who have been treated with other drugs or are new to treatment. The FDA also approved the drug for use in children aged 12 years and over, who weigh at least 40 kg (88 lbs) and who have not received treatment with a drug that has the same mechanism of action. About 50,000 people in the United States are infected with HIV each year and about 15,500 died in 2010, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Common side effects of Tivicay in clinical trials included insomnia and headache. Serious side effects included allergic reactions and abnormal liver function in patients who were also infected with hepatitis B or C. Patients received either Tivicay or Merck & Co’s  Isentress in combination with other HIV drugs; or they received Atripla, a fixed-dose combination of three HIV drugs made by Gilead Sciences Inc. A fifth trial evaluated the safety of the drug in children. Last week the FDA approved Alere Inc’s HIV test which is designed to diagnose HIV infection earlier.",8122013,http://www.reuters.com/article/glaxosmithkline-hivdrug/update-1-u-s-fda-approves-glaxosmithklines-hiv-drug-tivicay-idUSL4N0GD3VG20130812
374,MRK,Merck rolls out new training program for Zilmax customers,"(Reuters) - Pharmaceuticals giant, Merck and Co., facing questions from the cattle industry about the effects of its Zilmax feed additive on the health of cattle, on Tuesday responded with plans for a new quality control program to ensure the popular weight-adding drug is properly used. The news comes a week after Tyson Foods Inc. declared it would stop accepting Zilmax-fed beef given some cattle were observed arriving at its slaughter facilities with signs they were having difficulty walking or moving. Tyson Foods, the nation’s largest meat processor said the decision was not made over food-safety concerns, and the company said it did not know exactly what was causing the animals behavior, but Tyson officials said that animal health experts have suggested that the use of Zilmax may be one possible cause. That, in turn, has Tyson’s cattle suppliers faced with a choice of sticking with Zilmax and selling to other packers, or switching to a less-powerful alternative feed supplement, or even dropping the type of drug known as a beta-agonist such as Zilmax altogether. Beta-agonists are a class of drug approved and deemed safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and long used by the livestock industry to add weight to cattle, pigs and turkey in the weeks before slaughter. The class of drugs has come under scrutiny in recent months over concerns by Tyson, and JBS USA, another large cattle processor, when some animals were observed showing signs of distress and had difficulty walking after being fed beta-agonist additives. On Monday, Reuters reported that JBS USA’s top animal health executive, at an industry conference last week. showed a video of cattle having difficulty moving and showing signs of lameness. An FDA spokeswoman told Reuters Tuesday that the agency requires drug companies to report adverse drug events to the FDA. The agency declined to discuss whether it will investigate reports of animal behavior publicly discussed by Tyson and JBS in recent days. While Tyson announced its change only last week, there are some signs that the company has quietly been expanding its supply of beef free of beta-agonists. According to several feed lot operators interviewed by Reuters, the company began paying some feeders premium prices about six months ago to supply cattle that had not been fed beta-agonists. A feed operator in Kansas, who declined to be identified by name because of concerns that “this could be a big political issue,” said he plans to discontinue Zilmax use and instead exclusively use a competing beta-agonist, Eli Lilly & Co.’s Optaflexx. “The whole deal don’t matter to me one way or the other because their issue is not with Optaflexx,” the cattle feeder said. Herman Schumacher co-owner of L.D.L. Cattle Company, a 10,000 head privately-owned feedlot in Ipswitch, South Dakoa, said he has raised cattle free of beta agonists since beginning the business in 1986. Six months ago, he said, Tyson without any explanation began offering him a premium on cattle that had never consumed beta-agonists. Schumacher said he expects Tyson’s rivals to discontinue the use of beta-agonists, too. “Other packers have not floated out of this (Zilmax) yet, but with Tyson taking the lead on this I think the others will follow,” he said. The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, the beef industry’s trade group, said in a statement said its members base their feed decisions “on science, not speculation. At this time, there is no scientific basis for saying the use of beta-agonists caused the animal welfare concerns cited by Tyson in their decision to stop buying cattle fed Zilmax.” After Reuters’ report Tuesday, Merck’s animal health unit said it will require cattle feeders that use its drug Zilmax to undergo additional training as part of a five-step plan to deal with mounting questions over possible negative effects from the drug. The company also said in the next 30 days it will re-certify feed lot operators that use Zilmax, a process designed to make certain customers safely use the drug when feeding cattle. Merck also will launch what it termed a “scientific audit” that will follow Zilmax-fed cattle from the feed yards to the packing plant to determine potential causes of lameness and other mobility issues seen by Tyson and JBS.

Merck said it remains confident in the safety of the product, which had sales of $159 million last year in the United States and Canada, but will conduct an audit of how the product is used “from the feedyard to the packing plant.” The product is sold by Merck’s animal health unit.

382,MRK,Halt in Zilmax sales fuels demand for rival cattle feed product,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Merck & Co’s decision to suspend sales of its Zilmax cattle feed additive has caused such a surge in demand for rival Eli Lilly & Co’s Optaflexx that Lilly is telling some new customers it cannot immediately supply them, customers told Reuters. Zilmax became the focus of attention in the livestock industry after Tyson Foods Inc said on August 7 that it will stop buying Zilmax-fed cattle for slaughter beginning next month. Tyson, the biggest U.S. meat processor, said it was concerned about Zilmax potentially causing health problems for some cattle. Merck announced on August 16 it was temporarily suspending sales of the product in the United States and Canada. Optaflexx, sold by Lilly’s Elanco Animal Health, and Zilmax both belong to a family of drugs called beta-agonists, a class of non-hormone growth promoters that have been deemed safe for animals and humans by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Both products are fed to cattle prior to slaughter to increase weight by as much as 30 pounds of lean meat. Elanco denied that its supply of Optaflexx is short of the industry’s current demand. The company is “managing the supply over the next two weeks as we assess the long-term market demand,” company spokeswoman Colleen Parr Dekker told Reuters in a statement on Friday. Elanco last week told Reuters that its on-hand supply of Optaflexx was sufficient to handle demand. That assessment was focused on Tyson customers before the withdrawal announcement from Merck, Elanco said on Friday. Elanco declined to comment on how much demand for Optaflexx has increased in recent days. The company does not publicly break out sales figures for the additive. Some new Elanco customers told Reuters they are being put on a waiting list for Optaflexx due to limited supplies. Other new customers are having their orders only partially filled, said Tom Bejot, a feedlot manager in Ainsworth, Nebraska. Existing customers said they are being assured that their needs will continue to be filled by Elanco. “For all their customers who have been using Optaflexx, they’re calling to see how much everybody needs,” said Tom Williams, manager of Chappell Feedlot in Nebraska. Williams said an Elanco representative called his feedlot on Thursday to find out how much Optaflexx its cattle are fed each month. About 70 percent of cattle brought to slaughter in the United States are fed beta-agonists, according to industry estimates. Merck’s Zilmax was the dominant beta-agonist for U.S. cattle feeders, and last week Merck disclosed it had about $159 million in U.S. sales of Zilmax last year. Merck has said no safety issues have been discovered in 30 studies since Zilmax was introduced in the United States in 2007. Tight supplies of Optaflexx could temporarily pinch beef production at some feedlots, said John Nalivka, an expert on livestock and president of Sterling Marketing Inc. However, there should be little impact on the nation’s overall beef supply, he said. “We’re not going to run out of beef,” Nalivka said, adding that feeders can adjust feed rations and take other steps to control meat production. Some cattle feeders who formerly used Zilmax said they are frustrated that they are having trouble immediately ordering an alternative. For many, the drugs have been a way to reduce some of the economic pain caused by high costs for grain fed to cattle. Bejot Feedlots in Nebraska, which feeds Optaflexx to some of its 10,000 cattle, received a call on Thursday from an Elanco sales representative who said supplies of the drug were tightening, Tom Bejot said. According to Bejot, the representative said Bejot would continue to receive Optaflexx but that new customers will not be able to buy all they need. “Guys that are switching don’t get preferential treatment, at least until Elanco catches up,” said John Nelson, vice president of commodities for Producers Livestock Marketing Association ",8232013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-livestock-zilmax-lilly/halt-in-zilmax-sales-fuels-demand-for-rival-cattle-feed-product-idUSBRE97M11S20130823

384,MRK,"Q&A;:-Animal welfare consultant Grandin on Zilmax, beta-agonists","Aug 22 (Reuters) - Merck & Co. recruited Temple Grandin, an advocate for the humane treatment of livestock, to be on a board that will consult on the company’s Zilmax feed additive, which has been temporarily taken off the U.S. and Canadian markets following animal welfare concerns. Grandin, who frequently works for the meat industry, said she agreed to serve on the panel. Merck declined to divulge the identities of group invitees before board membership was set. Reuters has spoken to Grandin several times since Tyson Foods Inc on Aug. 7 said it would stop accepting beef fed Zilmax. Below is an edited transcript of Grandin’s answers to Reuters’ questions. Zilmax and other beta-agonists, a class of non-hormone growth promotants, are fed to cattle to add weight and reduce fat content in the meat prior to slaughter. Grandin has designed equipment widely used in slaughterhouses. McDonald’s, Cargill Inc and Whole Foods are among her clients. She told Reuters she has observed a succession of behavioral problems with cattle fed beta-agonists such as Merck’s Zilmax and Optaflexx, made by Eli Lilly’s Elanco Animal Health unit. Merck told Reuters it believes Zilmax is safe and the company is not aware of problems beyond those observed during the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval process. It has said it needs time to “audit” how Zilmax was being used. Elanco said in a statement that its agricultural feed supplement has been safely given to tens of millions of cattle, and reports of animals displaying problems “related to Optaflexx are very rare, and have decreased over time.” Q: Tyson said its decision to stop buying Zilmax-fed cattle was based on animal welfare concerns. Have you noticed any issues at the slaughterhouses where you have worked? A: When beta-agonists first came on the market in the early 2000s I worked at packing plants all the time. I started seeing problems showing up at packing plants that I’ve never seen before: stiff, sore-footed lameness and a lot of heat stress symptoms, including in Brahman cattle who are usually heat resistant. I want to emphasize not every group of cattle fed beta-agonists have this problem. Some groups of cattle have the problem and some don’t. I call it the “odd unevenness.” Q: Have these issues been constant across the years? A: I have seen it at five different plants with six different groups of cattle around the country. I saw it when ractopamine (Optaflexx) came out, then again when Zilmax came on the market. This summer, in particular, we’ve seen lots of these troubles. The hot weather really makes this worse. (Grandin said she did not know what additives had been given to the distressed cows she saw this summer.) Q: Are these animals showing similar distress in the feedlots? A: The cattle can look fine at the feedlot. Then you put them on a truck, take them to the plant, then put them in a pen for two hours, and then they don’t want to leave the pen. This is a problem that tends to show up more at the plant after you’ve stressed the cattle a bit.    Q: How common are these issues? A: When there is a problem, half the cattle are perfectly O.K. Then you have 5 to 10 percent that are severely affected, reluctant to move, with sore feet and stiffness. Then you’ll have another 30 to 40 percent that are sore-footed and stiff, but it’s milder. I call it walking on hot metal. They act like the floor is hot.   Q: What are the signs of heat stress that you have encountered? A: Open-mouth breathing, tongues out. These cattle are suffering. It’s cruel to have animals that are stiff and sore and hot and panting with their mouths open. Cattle don’t normally do that. Beef cattle do not need to be pushed to move. Cattle should run off the trucks.    Q: Are these problems caused by the animals being too heavy?  A: It’s not that the animals are too big for their legs. I’ve handled plenty of big cattle - this is not the cause of this type of lameness. It’s not the weight. It’s a different type of lameness that I have not seen before the introduction of these products.    Q: Would you like beta-agonist use to stop? A: I’m not going to go so far as to say that. If I’m at a plant, I do not want to see this sore-footed lameness. I have worked 40 years improving how animals are handled at slaughter plants and now the cattle are hard to handle. You’ve got to get me cattle I can handle.",8232013,http://www.reuters.com/article/livestock-zilmax-grandin/qa-animal-welfare-consultant-grandin-on-zilmax-beta-agonists-idUSL2N0GM25620130823

Merck said on Monday it had received a “complete response letter” from the FDA on its resubmission of sugammadex for approval. Such letters typically lay out U.S. Food and Drug Administration concerns that need to be addressed before a medicine can gain approval. Merck said it was evaluating the letter and “expects to be able to determine a path forward in the very near future.” In July, the FDA canceled a meeting of outside advisers who were scheduled to vote on whether to recommend the drug for approval. Merck said then that the agency needed more time to assess findings from an inspection of a clinical trial site. In 2008, the FDA declined to approve sugammadex, citing concerns about its possible association with allergic reactions and bleeding. BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei found a bright spot in the drug’s latest delay. “The FDA concerns in the complete response letter do not seem related to the product’s clinical profile. We expect the issues to eventually be resolved,” he said in a research note. Arfaei said he expects U.S. approval of sugammadex by the second quarter of 2014 and forecast worldwide sales of $574 million in 2015. The drug is already approved in 50 countries, including Japan.

389,MRK,Merck drug triggers response in 24 percent of lung cancer patients,"(Reuters) - Early data from a small trial of Merck & Co Inc’s experimental immunotherapy cancer drug, known as MK-3475, showed that about a quarter of lung cancer patients responded to the treatment. Data from the trial is slated for presentation in Sydney, Australia, later this month at the World Conference on Lung Cancer, Merck said in a statement on Tuesday. The antibody drug, once known as lambrolizumab, is part of a new class of compounds designed to block the activity of a receptor on immune cells called programmed death 1 or PD-1. The aim of the drugs is to spur the body’s own immune system to attack cancer cells. “The data for now suggest relatively similar response rates in NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) for Merck’s ‘3475, Bristol’s nivolumab and Roche’s MPDL3280A as single agents,” JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott said in a research note. “With lung cancer representing the largest potential market for PD-1 therapy, we will closely watch how data in the space unfolds.” Merck said results from 38 patients whose cancer had stopped responding to earlier rounds of treatment showed that 24 percent had an immune-system response to the drug. The trial also showed that 21 percent of patients experienced tumor shrinkage. The most common side effects seen in the trial were fatigue, rash, itching and diarrhea. Earlier on Tuesday, Merck said it would cut annual operating costs by $2.5 billion and eliminate 8,500 jobs. [ID:nL1N0HR0H0] Its shares rose 2.4 percent to close at $48.74 on the New York Stock Exchange.

391,MRK,"Merck to slash annual costs by $2.5 billion, cut 8,500 jobs","(Reuters) - Merck & Co, taking a cue from rival drugmakers that have slashed research spending to bolster earnings, said it will cut annual operating costs by $2.5 billion and eliminate 8,500 jobs, or more than 10 percent of its global workforce. Merck, whose shares rose 2.3 percent, said it aims to narrow its focus to products with the best chance of winning regulatory approval and achieving substantial sales. It will jettison research products with less likelihood of success. It plans to pull the plug on some drugs already in late-stage trials, and will license some products to other companies. The job cuts would be in addition to expected remaining cuts of 7,500 positions from a 2011 restructuring that involved elimination of 13,000 positions - largely of administrative personnel but also related to sale or closure of manufacturing sites. Merck, like Pfizer Inc, AstraZeneca Plc and Sanofi in recent years, is reaching again for its axe because of competition from generic medicines, stalled sales growth of its important drugs and failures or delays for high-profile experimental drugs. But half the job cuts from Merck’s new restructuring will come from research and development, which has been a protected sphere for the drugmaker, which has long been renowned for its research prowess but has stumbled in recent years. “We’re not doing indiscriminate cuts in research and development, we’re doing surgery around where we should invest,” Merck Chief Executive Kenneth Frazier said in an interview. Frazier said the company is now evaluating which drugs or disease areas to discard and which to keep, but few decisions have yet been made. “And by attacking our cost bases, we will free up resources for mergers and acquisitions and business development,” Frazier said, noting the company’s strong interest in buying new drugs or licensing them from other drugmakers. About 40 percent of the cost-cutting from the new initiative, or $1 billion, will be realized by the end of 2014. The cuts will come equally from marketing and administrative areas and from research and development, Merck said. The rest of the cuts will be completed by the end of 2015, it said. One of the more worrisome challenges facing Merck is slowing sales growth for its biggest franchise, the diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet which have combined annual sales of $6 billion. They have been Merck’s growth engine over the past three years but are stalling due to similar rival drugs and newer classes of diabetes treatments. And sales of Merck’s former top seller, its asthma drug Singulair, have plunged 80 percent due to generic competition, and other Merck medicines will also face cheaper generics soon. Singulair sales reached $6 billion a year at their peak. Pfizer Inc became an industry trendsetter in aggressive cost-cutting in early 2011 when it announced plans to chop annual research spending by as much as $3 billion. It went on to close numerous research sites and has halted or curtailed spending for research on drugs for allergy, urology, internal medicine and other therapeutic areas requiring large sales forces. Wall Street has cheered Pfizer’s moves, especially since the company has launched many new medicines since the changes, including cancer drugs. Moreover, it has divested its animal health and infant formula businesses, and plans to return much of the proceeds to investors through share buybacks. Merck dug in its heels after Pfizer’s dramatic streamlining, saying it planned to hold steady with its research spending in order to advance its promising medicines through clinical trials. Alex Arfaei, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, said the cost-cutting will be helpful in the short term, especially next year, when he expects Merck revenues to be flat due to increased pressure on Januvia. But he said he was concerned that Merck was putting too much faith in a handful of experimental drugs, including a new type of cancer drug called a PD-1 inhibitor that works by boosting the immune system, a new type of treatment for Alzheimer’s disease called a BACE inhibitor, and improved versions of its Gardasil vaccine to prevent cervical cancer and its treatment for hepatitis C. “Overall, today’s announcement makes us more cautious about the potential of Merck’s pipeline” of experimental drugs, Arfaei said. Merck in April replaced its long-time research chief, Peter Kim, with Roger Perlmutter, a former Amgen Inc research head who is expected to better acquaint Merck with biotech drugs - injectable drugs made in living cells that have become standard treatments for a wide array of diseases, including cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. Merck has focused mainly on development of conventional drugs, or pills, although it is a also leader in vaccines. The company had several triumphs under Kim, including development of Januvia, its Gardasil vaccine to prevent cervical cancer, its Zostavax shingles vaccine, and its Isentress treatment for HIV. But more recently, it has been hurt by failed trials of cholesterol treatment Tredaptive and migraine drug telcagepant, and a regulatory delay for a new type of osteoporosis medicine called odanacatib. Moreover, cost savings from Merck’s 2009 purchase of rival Schering Plough have mostly dried up and are no longer able to boost company earnings. Merck said it still expects full-year 2013 earnings of $3.45 to $3.55 per share, excluding special items. It earned $3.82 per share last year.

392,MRK,"UPDATE 5-Merck to slash annual costs by $2.5 bln, cut 8,500 jobs","By Ransdell Pierson Oct 1 (Reuters) - Merck & Co, taking a cue from rival drugmakers that have slashed research spending to bolster earnings, said it will cut annual operating costs by $2.5 billion and eliminate 8,500 jobs, or more than 10 percent of its global workforce. Merck, whose shares rose 2.3 percent, said it aims to narrow its focus to products with the best chance of winning regulatory approval and achieving substantial sales. It will jettison research products with less likelihood of success. It plans to pull the plug on some drugs already in late-stage trials, and will license some products to other companies. The job cuts would be in addition to expected remaining cuts of 7,500 positions from a 2011 restructuring that involved elimination of 13,000 positions - largely of administrative personnel but also related to sale or closure of manufacturing sites. Merck, like Pfizer Inc, AstraZeneca Plc and Sanofi in recent years, is reaching again for its axe because of competition from generic medicines, stalled sales growth of its important drugs and failures or delays for high-profile experimental drugs. But half the job cuts from Merck’s new restructuring will come from research and development, which has been a protected sphere for the drugmaker, which has long been renowned for its research prowess but has stumbled in recent years. “We’re not doing indiscriminate cuts in research and development, we’re doing surgery around where we should invest,” Merck Chief Executive Kenneth Frazier said in an interview. Frazier said the company is now evaluating which drugs or disease areas to discard and which to keep, but few decisions have yet been made. “And by attacking our cost bases, we will free up resources for mergers and acquisitions and business development,” Frazier said, noting the company’s strong interest in buying new drugs or licensing them from other drugmakers. About 40 percent of the cost-cutting from the new initiative, or $1 billion, will be realized by the end of 2014. The cuts will come equally from marketing and administrative areas and from research and development, Merck said. The rest of the cuts will be completed by the end of 2015, it said. One of the more worrisome challenges facing Merck is slowing sales growth for its biggest franchise, the diabetes drugs  Januvia and Janumet which have combined annual sales of $6 billion. They have been Merck’s growth engine over the past three years but are stalling due to similar rival drugs and newer classes of diabetes treatments. And sales of Merck’s former top seller, its asthma drug Singulair, have plunged 80 percent due to generic competition, and other Merck medicines will also face cheaper generics soon. Singulair sales reached $6 billion a year at their peak. Pfizer Inc became an industry trendsetter in aggressive cost-cutting in early 2011 when it announced plans to chop annual research spending by as much as $3 billion. It went on to close numerous research sites and has halted or curtailed spending for research on drugs for allergy, urology, internal medicine and other therapeutic areas requiring large sales forces. Wall Street has cheered Pfizer’s moves, especially since the company has launched many new medicines since the changes, including cancer drugs. Moreover, it has divested its animal health and infant formula businesses, and plans to return much of the proceeds to investors through share buybacks. Merck dug in its heels after Pfizer’s dramatic streamlining, saying it planned to hold steady with its research spending in order to advance its promising medicines through clinical trials. Alex Arfaei, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, said the cost-cutting will be helpful in the short term, especially next year, when he expects Merck revenues to be flat due to increased pressure on Januvia. But he said he was concerned that Merck was putting too much faith in a handful of experimental drugs, including a new type of cancer drug called a PD-1 inhibitor that works by boosting the immune system, a new type of treatment for Alzheimer’s disease called a BACE inhibitor, and improved versions of its Gardasil vaccine to prevent cervical cancer and its treatment for hepatitis C. “Overall, today’s announcement makes us more cautious about the potential of Merck’s pipeline” of experimental drugs, Arfaei said. Merck in April replaced its long-time research chief, Peter Kim, with Roger Perlmutter, a former Amgen Inc research head who is expected to better acquaint Merck with biotech drugs - injectable drugs made in living cells that have become standard treatments for a wide array of diseases, including cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. Merck has focused mainly on development of conventional drugs, or pills, although it is a also leader in vaccines. The company had several triumphs under Kim, including development of Januvia, its Gardasil vaccine to prevent cervical cancer, its Zostavax shingles vaccine, and its Isentress treatment for HIV. But more recently, it has been hurt by failed trials of cholesterol treatment Tredaptive and migraine drug telcagepant, and a regulatory delay for a new type of osteoporosis medicine called odanacatib. Moreover, cost savings from Merck’s 2009 purchase of rival Schering Plough have mostly dried up and are no longer able to boost company earnings. Merck said it still expects full-year 2013 earnings of $3.45 to $3.55 per share, excluding special items. It earned $3.82 per share last year. It plans to take restructuring charges of $900 million to $1 billion this year, mostly in the third quarter.

393,MRK,"US STOCKS-Wall St climbs, expecting government shutdown will be brief","* U.S. government shutdown could hurt markets if prolonged * Merck shares rise on announcement of job cuts * Automakers post monthly sales results * Indexes up: Dow 0.45 pct, S&P; 0.79 pct, Nasdaq 1.03 pct By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, Oct 1 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday after limping to the end of the third quarter, but investors appeared confident a deal could be reached in Washington to settle a partial shutdown of the U.S. government. Congress missed a midnight deadline to agree on a spending bill, resulting in up to 1 million workers being put on unpaid leave. A bipartisan fight over President Barack Obama’s healthcare law was at the center of the political impasse. The Democratic-led U.S. Senate on Tuesday voted to kill Republicans’ latest attempts to modify an emergency government funding bill, stripping proposed amendments from the spending bill and sending back to the House a “clean” bill that would extend funding for government agencies until Nov. 15. Shares dropped on Monday as the deadline approached without any apparent progress in breaking the stalemate, giving the S&P; 500 its seventh decline in the last eight trading days of September. However, some market participants viewed any pullback as a buying opportunity in the absence of an extended shutdown. “If this (shutdown) is short like most of them have been, it won’t really change much as far as the fundamentals. Thus we are still pretty bullish on U.S. stocks,” said Mike Serio, regional chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Bank in Denver, Colorado. “However, if this does go on for a long time, we may have to go back and revisit our GDP growth number at some point.” Investors were also eyeing the tone of negotiations as a possible template for the upcoming debate on lifting the debt ceiling in mid-October, which could result in a default on U.S. debt if not passed. The debt limit issue is considered to have a bigger impact on markets. “The more important event is going to be the debt ceiling. If for some reason they cannot do that, then we definitely will have to rethink our GDP number,” said Serio. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 68.06 points or 0.45 percent, to 15,197.73, the S&P; 500 gained 13.33 points or 0.79 percent, to 1,694.88 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 38.734 points or 1.03 percent, to 3,810.214. Volume was modest, with about 2.6 billion shares traded around the halfway point of the session. Merck & Co announced a plan to cut annual operating costs by $2.5 billion by the end of 2015 and eliminate 8,500 jobs. Shares rose 1.2 percent to $48.77 as one of the biggest boosts to the S&P; 500. Walgreen Co reported fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations, helped by a rise in generic drug sales. Shares gained 4.4 percent to $55.15. Ford Motor Co advanced 2.3 percent to $17.26 after the company reported a 6 percent increase in its September sales. General Motors edged up 0.1 percent to $36.02 following its sales results. In the latest economic data, the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index came in at 56.2, up from the previous month and above expectations for a reading of 55. The release of the government’s report on construction spending in August, which had been scheduled for 10 a.m, was delayed because of the shutdown. If no deal is reached by Friday, the closely watched payroll report will also be delayed. The report on private sector hiring in September by payrolls processor Automatic Data Processing will be released on Wednesday at 8:15 a.m. (1215).

South Korea said on Wednesday it had found zilpaterol, an animal growth enhancer, in 22 tonnes of beef from a work site of Swift Beef, a unit of JBS USA Holdings Inc. South Korea asked the United States to verify the cause of the contamination. The USDA, in a notice from its Food Safety and Inspection Service, did not explain why the Cactus plant was no longer eligible to export to South Korea. “The USDA has been actively engaged and we will work with them to resolve the situation,” JBS spokesman Cameron Bruett said on Thursday. South Korea is among a number of countries that have not approved zilpaterol for use in meat. The detection of the additive raised concerns that it may still be in the supply chain after drug maker Merck & Co  halted sales of Zilmax, the top-selling zilpaterol-based additive, on Aug. 16 amidst concerns about its impact on animal health. It also comes at a time when U.S. beef prices are rising because of tightening supplies and South Korea is reducing meat imports amid increased domestic production.",10102013,http://www.reuters.com/article/beef-usa-jbs/swift-beef-plant-in-texas-cannot-ship-meat-to-south-korea-usda-idUSL1N0I01TR20131010

401,MRK,"Merck's Januvia, animal health products slump; shares off","(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) reported lower sales of its Januvia diabetes treatment, fresh evidence its biggest product is losing ground to newer drugs, and also spooked investors with falling quarterly sales of its animal health products. The company’s shares dropped 2.6 percent, or $1.19, to $45.33 in afternoon trading. Merck’s animal health brands, which typically prop up results, suffered a 2 percent sales decline in third quarter, hurt by the recent decision to suspend marketing of its Zilmax weight-gain feed supplement amid concerns it was causing lameness in cattle. “The fundamentals of the business remain solid despite what we saw in the quarter,” Chief Executive Ken Frazier told analysts on a conference call, referring to the animal health unit. Global sales of Januvia fell 5 percent in the quarter to $927 million. Combined sales of the pill and a related drug called Janumet fell 1 percent to $1.4 billion, versus 5 percent growth in the prior quarter, and marked a return to declines in the first quarter. “It looks like Januvia might be plateauing,” said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover, adding the trend could continue to put pressure on Merck’s profits as it strives to develop new medicines. ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said combined U.S. sales of Januvia and Janumet were $91 million short of Wall Street estimates, and may force Merck to back off its earlier prediction that the Januvia franchise will grow by the “mid-single-digit” percentage range this year in the United States. Januvia sales have grown by leaps and bounds since the drug was approved in 2006 - the first member of a new class of oral diabetes treatment called DPP4 inhibitors. But three similar drugs have been introduced since then and are taking market share from Januvia, including Bristol-Myers Co’s (BMY.N) Onglyza, and Tradjenta from privately held Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N). Merck said the falling number of Januvia prescriptions in the quarter was a surprise and cause for concern. “If the volumes continue to decline, definitely it will be a problem for us,” Adam Schechter, head of global human health at Merck, said on the conference call. Merck shares have risen 11 percent this year, only half the gains seen for the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index .DRG of large U.S. and European drugmakers, on worries about Januvia and failures or regulatory setbacks for a handful of its most important experimental drugs. Its shares have also been held back by plunging sales of its former top product, Singulair for asthma, which began facing cheaper generics last year. In the meantime, rivals like Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) have launched a crop of new medicines and have high hopes for others in clinical trials. Faced with Januvia’s stall and setbacks for its drug pipeline, Merck said early this month it will cut annual operating costs by $2.5 billion and eliminate 8,500 jobs, or more than 10 percent of its global workforce. Like other drugmakers that have slashed costs in the past three years, most notably Pfizer, Merck said it will narrow its focus to products with the best chance of winning regulatory approval and achieving substantial sales. That means it will scrap some drugs already in late-stage trials, while licensing products from other drugmakers. The company earned $1.12 billion, or 38 cents per share, in the third quarter, compared with $1.73 billion, or 56 cents per share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding special items, Merck earned 92 cents per share. Analysts, on average, expected 88 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Merck said the better-than-expected earnings was largely due to efforts to manage costs across the board. Research and development spending was lower in part because costly late-stage trials of some medicines had been delayed until the fourth quarter. Company sales fell 4 percent to $11.03 billion, below Wall Street estimates of $11.12 billion. They would have fallen 2 percent if not for the stronger dollar, which lowers the value of sales in overseas markets. Merck’s Gardasil vaccine to prevent cervical cancer was a bright spot in the quarter, with sales rising 15 percent to $665 million, helped by additional sales to government healthcare providers. And sales of Remicade, used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, rose 12 percent to $574 million. Merck expects full-year earnings of $3.48 to $3.52 per share, excluding special items. Early this month, it forecast $3.45 to $3.55 per share. ",10282013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-merck-results/mercks-januvia-animal-health-products-slump-shares-off-idUSBRE99R0H020131028

Combined sales of the pill and a related drug called Janumet fell 1 percent to $1.4 billion, versus 5 percent growth in the prior quarter, and marked a return to declines in the first quarter. “It looks like Januvia might be plateauing,” said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover, adding the trend could continue to put pressure on Merck’s profits as it strives to develop new medicines. ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said combined U.S. sales of Januvia and Janumet were $91 million short of Wall Street estimates, and may force Merck to back off its earlier prediction that the Januvia franchise will grow by the “mid-single-digit” percentage range this year in the United States. Januvia sales have grown by leaps and bounds since the drug was approved in 2006 - the first member of a new class of oral diabetes treatment called DPP4 inhibitors. But three similar drugs have been introduced since then and are taking market share from Januvia, including Bristol-Myers Co’s Onglyza, and Tradjenta from privately held Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly and Co. Merck said the falling number of Januvia prescriptions in the quarter was a surprise and cause for concern. “If the volumes continue to decline, definitely it will be a problem for us,” Adam Schechter, head of global human health at Merck, said on the conference call. Merck shares have risen 11 percent this year, only half the gains seen for the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index of large U.S. and European drugmakers, on worries about Januvia and failures or regulatory setbacks for a handful of its most important experimental drugs. Its shares have also been held back by plunging sales of its former top product, Singulair for asthma, which began facing cheaper generics last year. In the meantime, rivals like Pfizer Inc and Johnson & Johnson have launched a crop of new medicines and have high hopes for others in clinical trials. Faced with Januvia’s stall and setbacks for its drug pipeline, Merck said early this month it will cut annual operating costs by $2.5 billion and eliminate 8,500 jobs, or more than 10 percent of its global workforce. Like other drugmakers that have slashed costs in the past three years, most notably Pfizer, Merck said it will narrow its focus to products with the best chance of winning regulatory approval and achieving substantial sales. That means it will scrap some drugs already in late-stage trials, while licensing products from other drugmakers. The company earned $1.12 billion, or 38 cents per share, in the third quarter, compared with $1.73 billion, or 56 cents per share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding special items, Merck earned 92 cents per share. Analysts, on average, expected 88 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Merck said the better-than-expected earnings was largely due to efforts to manage costs across the board. Research and development spending was lower in part because costly late-stage trials of some medicines had been delayed until the fourth quarter. Company sales fell 4 percent to $11.03 billion, below Wall Street estimates of $11.12 billion. They would have fallen 2 percent if not for the stronger dollar, which lowers the value of sales in overseas markets. Merck’s Gardasil vaccine to prevent cervical cancer was a bright spot in the quarter, with sales rising 15 percent to $665 million, helped by additional sales to government healthcare providers. And sales of Remicade, used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, rose 12 percent to $574 million. Merck expects full-year earnings of $3.48 to $3.52 per share, excluding special items. Early this month, it forecast $3.45 to $3.55 per share.",10282013,http://www.reuters.com/article/merck-results/update-4-mercks-januvia-animal-health-products-slump-shares-off-idUSL1N0II0E520131028

The S&P; 500 has risen more than 6 percent since Oct. 8, its lowest point during the partial government shutdown and debate over raising the debt ceiling. The gains have sent the benchmark to a series of record highs, largely on investor expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will keep stimulus measures in place for at least several months as a result of the damage done to the economy by the political wrangling in Washington. “The Fed is not going anywhere, which is what caused the rally for the last week-and-a-half, but now the market does feel a little bit tired, it certainly feels like the market is ahead of where the fundamentals say,” said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York. “As much as everyone tells us the economy is turning around, the macro data is not supporting that, so it’s confusing.” Investors could take their cue from corporate earnings as a catalyst for any further gains or pullback, with Apple Inc’s  highly anticipated results after the market closes, though results have been mixed thus far. Dow component Merck & Co fell 2.7 percent to $45.30, one of the biggest drags on the Dow, after reporting a decline in sales of its Januvia diabetes treatment, raising concerns about growth prospects for its biggest product. Biogen Idec posted a rise in its third-quarter earnings and boosted its full-year earnings and revenue outlook, sending its shares up 1.4 percent to $255.80. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 12.13 points or 0.08 percent, to 15,558.15, the S&P; 500 gained 0.67 points or 0.04 percent, to 1,760.44 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 10.231 points or 0.26 percent, to 3,933.129. Based on Thomson Reuters data through Monday morning, S&P; 500 earnings are expected to have risen just 3.4 percent in the third quarter. Of the 249 companies in the S&P; 500 that have reported earnings so far, 69.1 percent beat analysts’ expectations, above both the 63 percent beat rate since 1994 and the 66 percent rate for the past four quarters. Revenue has been lackluster, however, with growth seen at 2.2 percent for the quarter. Just 53.9 percent have beaten sales estimates, below the 61 percent rate since 2002, but above the 49 percent rate for the past four quarters.

Corporate earnings could serve as a catalyst, with investors especially looking to Apple Inc’s  results after the market closes, though the season has been mixed thus far. The gains this year have largely come from expectations that the Fed would not slow its stimulus policies for several months. The Fed’s policy-making committee will meet Tuesday and  Wednesday and, according to analysts, is extremely unlikely to alter its policies. “In order for the ball to keep rolling on Wall Street, we’ll need to know that the Fed’s stimulus will stay in place, giving us abundant liquidity,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. “In the meantime, we’ve gone something like 500 days without a 10 percent correction, and at some point earnings will have to catch up with current valuations.” Third-quarter results have been mixed, with revenue growth a concern in particular.

Biogen Idec posted a rise in its third-quarter earnings and boosted its full-year earnings and revenue outlook. Shares rose 2.3 percent to $257.76.

The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 3.42 points, or 0.09 percent, at 3,939.94. The S&P; 500 is up about 23 percent this year, just shy of the 23.5 percent gain in 2009. Surpassing the 2009 advance would give the index its biggest annual gain in a decade. Much of those gains have come recently, with both the Dow and S&P; 500 posting their third straight week of gains last week.

A spokeswoman for the company’s Merck Animal Health unit said that while “it is too early to speculate on when we will resume sales for Zilmax in the U.S. and Canada,” Merck was pushing forward with its quality control program to ensure the weight-adding drug is being properly used. Merck halted sales of Zilmax in August after Tyson Foods Inc. said it would stop accepting Zilmax-fed beef given some cattle were observed arriving for slaughter with signs they were having difficulty walking or moving. Merck has said it stands behind the safety of its product. The email from company spokeswoman Pamela Eisele said Merck was “committed to completing this as quickly as possible, while also ensuring it is conducted appropriately and with rigorous scientific measures.” In a separate statement, Merck said it has formed an advisory board that includes representatives from meat processors, cattle feeder operations, producers, veterinarians, academics and industry consultants. The company declined to say who had been appointed to the board, which convened for the first time in October. In August, Tyson Foods, the largest U.S. meat processor, said its decision to stop using Zilmax was not made over food-safety concerns. It said it did not know exactly what was causing the animals’ behavior, but Tyson officials said animal health experts suggested that the use of Zilmax may be one possible cause. Cattle carcass weights have dipped in recent weeks as feedlots rush animals to market to cash in on record-high prices but are no longer feeding them the growth promotant, analysts and economists said. Feed lot operators have been peppering Merck with questions over if or when Zilmax sales will resume, according to nutritionists and feed lot owners who have spoken to Merck. Lighter cattle weights have meant less beef at a time when there are fewer cattle going to slaughter.

South Korea plans to begin accepting meat from cattle raised with the muscle-growing supplement early next year, a senior official in the country’s food ministry said, opening the door to beef imports after a government risk assessment found the additive could be permitted at certain levels. To resurrect the once popular drug in the United States, Merck will need to shake this summer’s controversy over animal welfare problems - and convince ranchers, feedlot customers and meatpackers that Zilmax was not to blame for some cattle that arrived at slaughter plants having difficulty walking and apparently in pain. It could be a tough sell: On Wednesday, agricultural giant Cargill Inc CARG.UL told Reuters it would not allow Zilmax-fed beef to enter its supply chain until questions over cattle health issues have been resolved and “until Asia and other trading partners accept it in their markets. The move by Cargill underscores how the U.S. livestock industry is being pulled in opposing directions: It needs to produce more meat for a growing global population, and it needs to assure corporate customers and an often skeptical public that the use of livestock drugs in meat production is safe. Merck declined to comment on Cargill’s action. In August, the New Jersey-based pharmaceutical company voluntarily suspended sales of Zilmax in the United States and Canada after Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N) said it would stop accepting Zilmax-fed beef as it had observed some cattle arriving for slaughter in physical distress. Merck defended its product, and launched an audit to ensure that the federally approved livestock drug was being properly used in the field and that customers were not misusing it. The company also formed an industry and academic advisory board to study the effects of Zilmax on animals. Reuters on Tuesday reported that Merck was working toward reintroducing the product, news that appeared to catch Cargill and other companies by surprise. JBS USA JBS.UL and Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N) declined to comment on the matter. National Beef Packing Co NBEEF.UL did not return calls for comment. Sources at JBS and Tyson said animal health experts at the companies remain concerned about the still unknown reasons why cattle displayed signs of distress when arriving at slaughter plants this past summer. Although Zilmax’s $159 million in U.S. sales last year make up a small slice of Merck’s $47.3 billion in annual revenue, the problems with the additive have caught the attention of Wall Street. Merck’s chief executive officer, Kenneth C. Frazier, faced questions on Zilmax’s fate during the company’s quarterly earnings conference call on Monday. The suspension of Zilmax in the United States and Canada took a bite out of worldwide sales of Merck’s animal health products, which has been a high-margin business. The unit’s sales fell 2 percent in the third quarter, to $800 million, and Frazier said Zilmax “was a major issue,” though he added that the fundamentals of the animal health business remain solid. Asked by an analyst whether Merck is considering a spinoff of its animal-health unit, Frazier said the company is “sharpening our focus” on its animal health and consumer care groups. “We are currently evaluating those businesses the way we are evaluating everything, to figure out whether those businesses produce the most value inside our portfolio or outside our portfolio,” he said. The hurdles for Merck in reintroducing Zilmax get higher the longer the product is off the market. Competitors include Eli Lilly & Co’s (LLY.N) Elanco Animal Health unit, with its Optaflexx product. The Merck and Lilly products are part of a drug class called beta-agonists. Zilmax is based on an active ingredient called zilpaterol, while Optaflexx is based on ractopamine. Ractopamine has not been linked to any of the recent animal health concerns. “It will be challenging for Merck to regain traction given the negative public attention Zilmax has received following the announcement from Tyson Foods,” said Alex Arfaei, equity research analyst for BMO Capital Markets. “There are other options, such as Lilly’s Optaflexx, which are less controversial.” The debate over Zilmax comes at a time of stress in the cattle industry. Thousands of feedlots have gone out of business in recent years as drought and rising feed costs undercut their business model. The size of the national beef herd has fallen to its lowest level in 61 years, and domestic beef consumption dropped more than 8 percent from 2002 to 2011. For nearly a decade, many of the country’s 75,000 cattle feedlots have relied on weight-gain feed additives - Zilmax was often the beta-agonist of choice because it added around 30 pounds of lean meat to animals that average around 1,300 pounds when they go to slaughter. For Optaflexx, the company says its additive can add about 20 pounds of lean meat to a beef carcass. Today, the absence of Zilmax is being felt at slaughterhouses. Cattle carcass weights have dipped in recent weeks, and fewer animals are coming to market, a combination expected to lead to record cattle and beef prices at least through the coming year, analysts have said. Feedlots have favored Zilmax, even though it leads to a leaner meat that is less favored in the marketplace, because weight is more important for their profitability than meat quality, said Jim Robb, director of the Colorado-based Livestock Marketing Information Center. “The industry needs to decide where they want to be positioned,” Robb said. “Merck and some of the cattle feeders are pushing for tonnage, which is part of what they get paid for, not so much quality.” The European Union and other key export markets have grown increasingly firm on the banning of meat raised with beta-agonists. In the end, demand from overseas could become a key factor determining Zilmax’s fate, analysts said. Taiwan and South Korea accept imports of beef fed with ractopamine, but they are among a number of Asian countries, including China, that have not approved zilpaterol. Taiwan’s Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday said it found zilpaterol-tainted beef in a restaurant, prompting authorities to increase checks on U.S. meat imports. Earlier this month, South Korea suspended some U.S. beef imports after detecting zilpaterol in meat supplied by a unit of JBS USA. But with South Korea shifting its stance on accepting zilpaterol, analysts say other countries may follow. “With exports being one of the growth areas for the next few years, it gives you some pause as to how this is going to affect that trade.” said Altin Kalo, an economist at Steiner Consulting Group.

413,MRK,High cure rates seen with Merck oral hepatitis drugs: study,"(Reuters) - A combination of two oral hepatitis C treatments developed by Merck & Co led to high cure rates in previously untreated patients, indicating the company is a contender in the race to find new treatments for the liver destroying virus. The treatments tested with and without the older drug ribavirin led to cure rates of 96 percent to 100 percent, according to interim data from a small midstage clinical trial. The results appear to confirm Merck will be competitive in the crowded race to develop interferon-free treatments for hepatitis C, assuming they are repeated in larger studies that include more difficult to treat patient populations, such as those not helped by prior therapy. The 65-patient, 3-arm study tested MK-5172, a protease inhibitor, combined with MK-8742 from a highly promising new class of drugs called NS5A inhibitors for 12 weeks of treatment. Based on data available at the time the interim results were released, 55 of 56 patients who completed the therapy were considered to be cured of the virus which is transmitted through infected blood from sources such as infected hypodermic needles or blood transfusions. Patients who have no detectable levels of the virus in their blood 12 weeks after completing 12 weeks of treatment were deemed to be cured - a measure known as SVR 12, for sustained virologic response. In the arm of the study that did not include the older oral medicine ribavirin, all 11 patients who completed therapy with MK-5172 and the higher 50 milligram dose of MK-8742 taken once a day achieved SVR 12. All 12 patients who began that arm of the study had Genotype 1b of the liver disease, which is prevalent in Europe and Japan. It is considered somewhat easier to treat than Genotype 1a, the most common form of the virus seen in the United States, which may require a third drug in the regimen to achieve similarly high cure rates. The other two arms - one testing 50 mg of MK-8742 and one using 20 mg - did include ribavirin given twice a day. With the lower dose of the NS5A inhibitor, all 21 patients who completed therapy were deemed cured. In the group that received the higher dose in the three-drug combination, 23 of 24, or 96 percent, reached SVR 12. About three quarters of the patients in those arms were Genotype 1a. Of the 65 patients in the study, only one had experienced a relapse of the virus, according to the data to be presented on Sunday at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) meeting in Washington. “We are encouraged by these preliminary data for the combination of MK-5172 and MK-8742. It’s a one-two punch with both arms equally strong,” said Eliav Barr, head of infectious diseases for Merck. Current standard treatment regimens for hepatitis C take 24 or 48 weeks and includes injected interferon, which causes miserable flu-like symptoms that lead many patients to avoid or discontinue treatment. Several companies are developing new all-oral combinations that in clinical trials have cut treatment duration to 12 weeks for many patients while significantly increasing cure rates from about 75 percent with current drugs. Ultimately, physicians would like to also see regimens that do not require ribavirin, which has its own side effect issues, including anemia and rash. It is believed that tens of thousands of hepatitis C patients have delayed treatment while awaiting the new drugs expected to start reaching the market next year. Gilead Sciences is widely seen as being in the lead with a safe and effective all-oral combination, with Bristol-Myers-Squibb and AbbVie close behind. Gilead last week won an approval recommendation from a U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel for its highly regarded sofosbuvir. Some analysts believe the market for all-oral hepatitis C treatments could reach $20 billion as many more people get tested for the virus, given the very high cure rates, shorter treatment durations and tolerable side effects. An estimated 170 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis C, which if left untreated can lead to cirrhosis, need for a transplant or liver cancer. The Merck drugs were well tolerated with no serious adverse side effects reported. The most common side effects were fatigue, headache and nausea. Merck plans to expand the Phase II trial to about 400 additional patients, testing its drugs with and without ribavirin, and including those also infected with the HIV virus, those with cirrhosis and patients who have failed to be cured by prior treatments. It is also looking at a regimen of only 8 weeks in previously untreated patients that would include ribavirin.

416,MRK,U.S. heart guidelines threaten hot new cholesterol drugs,"(Reuters) - New U.S. guidelines on heart health that favor potent statins may threaten future use, or even approval, of a hot new class of experimental cholesterol drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors that have been billed as potential blockbuster treatments, analysts said on Wednesday. But use of Merck & Co’s widely prescribed Zetia, which is not a statin, and Vytorin, a related drug, will likely not be badly hurt anytime soon, analysts said, because doctors will need time to understand and accept the new guidelines. The Merck drugs have combined annual sales of more than $4 billion, or 10 percent of overall company revenue. “I read the new guidelines as a negative for any drugs that aren’t statins, including PCSK9 inhibitors,” said Jon LeCroy, an analyst with MKM Partners. The guidelines, issued by two leading U.S. medical organizations on Tuesday, recommend strong measures for patients at particularly high risk of heart attack or stroke, including use of more potent statins, although not the addition of other types of medicines that have not proven their worth. In fact, statins are the only class of cholesterol-lowering medicines that the guidelines recommend for patients who can tolerate them. The guidelines dropped an emphasis on specific targets for lowering LDL levels. Instead, they suggest that individual patient risk of developing heart disease rather than an LDL number should be used to determine the need for more intensive treatment. Even though Zetia has been on the market since 2002, Merck has not yet proven it reduces heart attack risk and stroke. A costly “outcomes trial” that has been under way for years is expected to answer that question by the second half of 2014. “I don’t think sales of Zetia and Vytorin will fall away rapidly,” said Atlantic Equities analyst Richard Purkiss. He said most doctors will wait for the Zetia trial results before abandoning the drug and Vytorin, which pairs Zetia with the generic form of Merck’s Zocor statin (simvastatin). LeCroy expects insurers to eventually put up bigger barriers to use of Zetia and Vytorin because of the guidelines, in favor of cheaper generic statins. “But it will probably take another year before the Merck drugs feel it.” A number of other non-statin cholesterol drugs could eventually also be hurt by the guidelines, analysts said. They include AbbVie Inc’s Niaspan, which raises “good” HDL cholesterol, AbbVie’s Trilipix, used to cut blood fats called triglycerides, and Amarin Corp’s recently approved Vascepa prescription fish oil product. Statins, such as AstraZeneca Plc’s Crestor and generic forms of Pfizer Inc’s similarly potent Lipitor (atorvastatin), are the most widely used cholesterol treatments and work by blocking the liver’s production of “bad” LDL cholesterol. Zetia instead works by curbing absorption of cholesterol by the intestines. Pfizer, Amgen Inc and a partnership of Regeneron Inc and French drugmaker Sanofi SA are racing to develop the PCSK9 inhibitors, all deemed by Wall Street capable of generating annual sales in the billions of dollars. The injectable drugs have generated excitement in mid-stage trials by slashing levels of LDL cholesterol 60 percent beyond reductions achieved with statins alone, without a pattern of serious side effects. The companies are now conducting late-stage trials of the drugs, which work by blocking a protein called PCSK9, whose natural function is to maintain the presence of LDL in the bloodstream. The drugmakers are hoping the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will approve their PCSK9 inhibitors on the basis of their ability to lower LDL. In the meantime, they are conducting their own outcomes studies to eventually prove to regulators that their medicines actually lower the risk of heart attack and stroke. Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst with ISI Group, said the new heart-protection guidelines “appear to raise the bar for cholesterol-lowering drugs” that are not statins. He said use of Amgen’s PCSK9 inhibitor, called AMG 145, if it is approved, could be slowed until data from the drug’s outcomes trial arrives in late 2017 or early 2018. Moreover, Schoenebaum said it remains to be seen whether the new guidelines, formulated by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology, will affect the willingness of U.S. and European regulators to approve the new class of cholesterol fighters. Schoenebaum said Wall Street has been expecting the Amgen drug to generate sales of $1.1 billion in 2018. For now, he said he is sticking to his own sales forecast of $500 million that year and more than $1.4 billion in 2020. “Given the (heart) guidelines, we remain comfortable with our estimates for now but will monitor how the guidelines are perceived by the wider medical community,” Schoenebaum said in a research note. Analysts said sales of Crestor were unlikely to get a big boost from the new guidelines because most doctors would reach instead for less costly generic Lipitor. Shares of Regeneron fell 3.7 percent, those of Amgen rose 0.7 percent and Amarin was unchanged, all on the Nasdaq. Pfizer rose 1.6 percent, Merck dropped 0.5 percent and AbbVie gained 0.8 percent, all on the New York Stock Exchange. Sanofi fell 0.8 percent in Paris, and AstraZeneca shares slipped 0.5 percent in London.

Other analysts said the new guidelines should not greatly hurt sales of Zetia and Vytorin, two blockbuster cholesterol fighters sold by Merck & Co that are not statins. Instead of cutting the body’s production of LDL, as statins do, they prevent the intestines from absorbing LDL. The analysts said most doctors already prescribing the two Merck drugs will probably continue to do so for the next year, until the medical community gets better acquainted with the new heart guidelines. Moreover, they said data from Zetia’s own outcomes trial is expected in the third quarter of 2014, and will definitively show whether it prevents heart attack and stroke. “I don’t think sales of Zetia and Vytorin will fall away rapidly,” said Atlantic Equities analyst Richard Purkiss.

418,MRK,Merck invests $107 million in China drug plant,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - German drugmaker Merck KGaA has invested 80 million euros ($107.67 million) in a manufacturing plant in China, the company said on Friday, underlining the importance of the market for global drug firms. The Shanghai-based facility will come online in 2017, producing drugs to treat China’s fast growing number of diabetics as well as cardiovascular and thyroid disorders, Merck’s biopharmaceutical unit said. Spending in the country’s healthcare sector is forecast to nearly triple to $1 trillion by 2020 from $357 billion in 2011, according to McKinsey, which has prompted many firms to invest in Chinese facilities and set up joint-ventures with local companies. The investment comes as international drug companies have come under pressure in China this year with authorities clamping down on the high price premiums many of them enjoy and a number of drugmakers have been caught up in corruption allegations. British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline is under investigation over allegations it funneled up to 3 billion yuan ($492.43 million) to travel agencies to facilitate bribes to doctors and officials to boost its drug sales. Large international drugmakers Novartis AG, AstraZeneca Plc, Sanofi, Eli Lilly & Co and Bayer AG have also been questioned by Chinese officials this year. Drugmakers have seen their sales suffer in the wake of the probes, with many Chinese doctors refusing to see drug representatives for fear of being caught up in the widening scandal. GSK’s third-quarter China sales fell 61 percent, while Sanofi lowered its 2013 profit guidance on China weakness. Industry insiders said that despite any roadbumps, international drug firms would be unlikely to turn their back on China, which is set to be the second-biggest drugs market behind the United States by 2016, according to IMS Health. “In 10 years it’s conceivable that China will become the largest pharmaceutical market in the world,” said Benjamin Bai, Shanghai-based partner at law firm Allen & Overy. “Do you think (drug firms) can afford to get out of China?

Updated results from the early-stage trial are set to be presented on Monday at the International Congress of the Society for Melanoma Research in Philadelphia.

The aim of the drugs is to spur the body’s own immune system to attack cancer cells. Merck said results from 135 patients whose melanoma had stopped responding to earlier rounds of treatment showed that 41 percent had tumor shrinkage - the rate was 51 percent in the high-dose group, and 40 percent for lowest-dose group. The company estimated overall survival at a year of treatment at 81 percent, but said the trial had not yet reached either a median duration of response or median overall survival.

422,MRK,Merck brings maternity program from poor nations to U.S. as deaths rise,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Merck & Co on Tuesday said it is expanding its “Merck for Mothers” program, which aims to reduce pregnancy-related deaths from impoverished countries such as Senegal and Zambia, to the United States - a stark reminder of how far the country lags other wealthy nations on key measures of health. “As Americans, we simply should not accept that 46 countries have lower rates” of reported maternal mortality, said Merck Chief Executive Ken Frazier. The fact that U.S. pregnancy-related deaths have nearly doubled since 1990 is “appalling” and “something we ought to be ashamed of,” he said. “Given how sophisticated medical care is in this country, I think most Americans would be astonished” that almost 900 women die each year as a result of pregnancy or childbirth and 50,000 have close calls, Frazier said. The U.S. drugmaker launched the $500 million global program in 2011 to reduce pregnancy-related deaths, focusing on India, Uganda and other poor countries with only rudimentary healthcare systems. However, pregnancy-related deaths in the United States have risen from 7.2 per 100,000 live births in 1987 to 17.8 per 100,000 in 2009 (the latest year with reliable data), according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The rate among African-American women is more than triple that of white women: 35.6 versus 11.7 deaths per 100,000 live births. The deaths include any that occur while a woman is pregnant or within a year after she gives birth, from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy. The leading maternal killers include cardiovascular disease, venous thromboembolism, hemorrhage, hypertension and sepsis, said Dr Mary D’Alton of Columbia University Medical Center in New York City, a specialist in high-risk maternal and fetal medicine. According to a study presented on Sunday at a meeting of the American Heart Association, heart disease is the leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths in California. “Women who give birth are usually young and in good health,” said Dr Afshan Hameed of the University of California, Irvine, who led the research. “So heart disease shouldn’t be the leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths, but it is.” The reasons for the rise in maternal mortality are unclear. Better reporting is part of it: some states only recently added a “pregnancy” check box to death certificates, said Dr Edward McCabe, medical director of the March of Dimes. “We’re getting better data, yes, but what these data are telling us is that we have an unacceptably high rate of pregnancy-related mortality.” Another likely reason for the increase is the rising prevalence of chronic diseases. Diabetes, chronic heart disease and hypertension - which can occur as a result of obesity - have become more common in women of reproductive age. And for unexplained reasons, the 2009 H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic killed many pregnant women in the United States: although pregnant women account for about 1 percent of the U.S. population, they made up 5 percent of the deaths, the CDC reported. “Merck for Mothers” will provide $6 million to U.S. programs in 10 states and three cities aimed at decreasing the number of women who die as a result of being pregnant or giving birth. Local programs include Baltimore Healthy Start, which works with neighborhood clinics to improve prenatal and primary care for pregnant women who have high-blood pressure, diabetes and other chronic conditions, and the Maternity Care Coalition in Philadelphia, whose “Safe Start MOMobile” sends health advocates into the homes of high-risk pregnant women. The program will also work through the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to develop standardized protocols for treating the leading causes of maternal death, said Columbia’s D’Alton. Currently, there is significant variation in how obstetricians and hospitals treat potentially-fatal obstetric emergencies such as postpartum hemorrhaging and embolisms. “There are no national guidelines about what to do in the event of a maternal emergency,” D’Alton said. “Variability is the enemy of safety.” Merck is collaborating with the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine to assess whether its maternity programs in Uganda, Zambia and other countries are making a difference, and will publish data on what works and what doesn’t.

The fact that U.S. pregnancy-related deaths have nearly doubled since 1990 is “appalling” and “something we ought to be ashamed of,” he said. “Given how sophisticated medical care is in this country, I think most Americans would be astonished” that almost 900 women die each year as a result of pregnancy or childbirth and 50,000 have close calls, Frazier said. The U.S. drugmaker launched the $500 million global program in 2011 to reduce pregnancy-related deaths, focusing on India, Uganda and other poor countries with only rudimentary healthcare systems. However, pregnancy-related deaths in the United States have risen from 7.2 per 100,000 live births in 1987 to 17.8 per 100,000 in 2009 (the latest year with reliable data), according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The rate among African-American women is more than triple that of white women: 35.6 versus 11.7 deaths per 100,000 live births. The deaths include any that occur while a woman is pregnant or within a year after she gives birth, from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy. The leading maternal killers include cardiovascular disease, venous thromboembolism, hemorrhage, hypertension and sepsis, said Dr Mary D’Alton of Columbia University Medical Center in New York City, a specialist in high-risk maternal and fetal medicine. According to a study presented on Sunday at a meeting of the American Heart Association, heart disease is the leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths in California. “Women who give birth are usually young and in good health,” said Dr Afshan Hameed of the University of California, Irvine, who led the research. “So heart disease shouldn’t be the leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths, but it is.” The reasons for the rise in maternal mortality are unclear. Better reporting is part of it: some states only recently added a “pregnancy” check box to death certificates, said Dr Edward McCabe, medical director of the March of Dimes. “We’re getting better data, yes, but what these data are telling us is that we have an unacceptably high rate of pregnancy-related mortality.” Another likely reason for the increase is the rising prevalence of chronic diseases. Diabetes, chronic heart disease and hypertension - which can occur as a result of obesity - have become more common in women of reproductive age. And for unexplained reasons, the 2009 H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic killed many pregnant women in the United States: although pregnant women account for about 1 percent of the U.S. population, they made up 5 percent of the deaths, the CDC reported. “Merck for Mothers” will provide $6 million to U.S. programs in 10 states and three cities aimed at decreasing the number of women who die as a result of being pregnant or giving birth. Local programs include Baltimore Healthy Start, which works with neighborhood clinics to improve prenatal and primary care for pregnant women who have high-blood pressure, diabetes and other chronic conditions, and the Maternity Care Coalition in Philadelphia, whose “Safe Start MOMobile” sends health advocates into the homes of high-risk pregnant women. The program will also work through the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to develop standardized protocols for treating the leading causes of maternal death, said Columbia’s D’Alton. Currently, there is significant variation in how obstetricians and hospitals treat potentially-fatal obstetric emergencies such as postpartum hemorrhaging and embolisms. “There are no national guidelines about what to do in the event of a maternal emergency,” D’Alton said. “Variability is the enemy of safety.” Merck is collaborating with the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine to assess whether its maternity programs in   Uganda, Zambia and other countries are making a difference, and will publish data on what works and what doesn’t.",11192013,http://www.reuters.com/article/health-merck-maternity/merck-brings-maternity-program-from-poor-nations-to-u-s-as-deaths-rise-idUSL2N0IR2BQ20131119

425,MRK,"UPDATE 2-Forest Labs to buy schizophrenia drug, cut costs","By Ransdell Pierson Dec 2 (Reuters) - Forest Laboratories Inc, which is facing patent expirations on several of its biggest drugs, on Monday said it plans to buy rights to a new schizophrenia treatment from Merck & Co and cut annual operating costs by $500 million in fiscal 2016. The specialty drugmaker said it will acquire rights to the oral drug, Saphris (asenapine), for an upfront payment of $240 million to Merck and additional payments on defined sales milestones. The product, which was approved in 2009, is also used to treat acute bipolar mania. Saphris, with annual revenue of about $150 million, has been a commercial disappointment for Merck. Earlier this year, Merck took $330 million in write-offs on the drug due to reduced sales expectations for it. Merck acquired the product through its merger in 2009 with Schering-Plough Corp. Forest Chief Executive Brent Saunders said his company plans to ramp up sales of Saphris, using 250 sales representatives dedicated to psychiatric products. “We have almost double the number of reps that will focus on this, compared to Merck,” Saunders said in an interview on Monday. But he declined to predict how greatly they could boost Saphris sales. Forest, whose shares rose almost 7 percent, said it would issue $1 billion in new long-term debt through an offering of eight-year senior unsecured fixed-rate notes. Proceeds from the offering will also be used to fund share repurchases and for general corporate purposes, the company said. Forest said its board authorized up to $1 billion in repurchases of its common stock, and the company would begin an initial $400 million accelerated buyback program before the end of the calendar year. The moves come two months after Forest named Saunders, the former head of eye-care products company Bausch & Lomb Inc, as its chief executive. He replaced Howard Solomon, who had been at the helm for more than 30 years. Forest, which makes antidepressant Lexapro and Alzheimer’s treatment Namenda, said it plans to reduce operating expenses by $500 million by the end of fiscal year 2016, compared with expenses it expects to incur in 2014. “Forest’s operating expenses as a percentage of sales will still likely be above industry averages by fiscal year 2016, something we anticipate will be addressed over time through either further cost restructuring opportunities or product acquisitions,” JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott said in a research note. Even so, Schott said the $500 million in cost savings could boost Forest’s earnings per share by more than $1 in fiscal year 2016 and beyond. Analysts, on average, have been expecting Forest to earn $1.09 per share in current fiscal year 2014 and $1.68 per share in fiscal year 2015, excluding special items. The company said about $270 million of the savings will come from streamlining and realigning research and development, while $150 million in savings will result from reduced  marketing expenses. Another $80 million in cost savings will come from a reduction in general, administrative and other expenses. Forest’s sales and earnings have been hurt since Lexapro, which once had annual sales of $2.3 billion, lost U.S patent protection in March 2012 and was clobbered by cheaper generics. And Namenda, meant to improve cognitive function in people with Alzheimer’s disease, loses patent protection in 2015. It has annual sales of more than $1.5 billion. The company is hoping that newer products, including a longer-acting form of Namenda called Namenda XR that has been on the market since 2010, will help cushion the blow once Namenda faces generic competition. The patent cliff, and whether Forest can rebuild a strong pipeline of experimental drugs, has caused nervousness on Wall Street. But company shares have jumped 55 percent this year, far outpacing a 25 percent gain for the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index , largely on hopes Saunders will buy lucrative new products and maximize sales of existing drugs. Forest had wrangled with billionaire investor Carl Icahn for years and ultimately struck a deal with him last summer that averted a proxy fight. Saunders had been Bausch & Lomb’s CEO from 2010 until August. Previously, he held senior positions at Schering-Plough, where he was considered a protege of that company’s former chief executive, Fred Hassan. Canada’s Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc  agreed to buy Bausch & Lomb for about $8.7 billion earlier this year. Forest shares were up $3.42 at $54.73 on the New York Stock Exchange.

427,MRK,Germany's Merck to buy hi-tech materials firm AZ for $2.6 billion,"FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - Merck, the world’s largest maker of liquid crystals used in TVs, tablet and smartphone screens, has agreed to buy Britain’s AZ Electronic Materials for $2.6 billion to expand its range of specialist chemicals for hi-tech gadgets. Germany’s family controlled Merck, which also makes cancer drugs and laboratory equipment, will pay 403.5 pence per share in cash for the supplier of chemicals used in Apple’s iPad, a 41 percent premium to AZ’s three-month average share price. While many of Merck’s peers in the pharmaceuticals industry are selling assets to focus on core businesses, Merck’s deal underscores its position as a diversified group, with the family behind it seeking to spread its investment risk. “Our philosophy has always been to never put all eggs in one basket,” finance chief Matthias Zachert told reporters on Thursday. The electronics industry uses specialty chemicals to produce chips, displays and other components. Many of the products are high-margin, but demand is closely tied to production cycles in manufacturing centers like Taiwan. Analysts said AZ’s optronics business, which supplies products to make flat panels, complemented Merck’s display business. They share customers such as Samsung, Sony, Panasonic and Innolux Corp. Zachert said the deal would also give Merck new customers, such as semiconductor maker SK Hynix Inc. Optronics made up 32 percents of AZ’s $363.7 million revenue in the six months to end-June. Supplies of chemicals to the chip-making industry accounted for the rest. Shares in the British group, which joined the stock market in 2010 at 240 pence, were up 51 percent to 398 pence at 1127 GMT. Shares in Merck were up 3.3 percent. Liberum Capital analysts said the price looked fair, with an 2014 enterprise value to core earnings multiple of 11.1 times in line with the 9-12 times range typical for previous specialty chemicals deals. “While a counter bid cannot be ruled out the offer price seems fair and the significant premium may deter others from bidding,” they said. Shares in AZ reached a high of 411.6 pence in March 2013 before a profit warning the following month, on weak demand from chipmakers, wiped a quarter of the value off its share price. Analysts at Espirito Santo said Merck was buying a high- quality company at the bottom of the cycle, noting AZ was well positioned for an upturn in the production of the wafers used to make chips. While the price meant the possibility of a counter bid was low, they said, other specialty materials companies such as Air Products, Air Liquide and Linde might be interested. Buying AZ, which was originally part of German chemical company Hoechst AG, would add 5 percent to Merck’s sales and 7 percent to core earnings based on 2012 numbers, DZ Bank analyst Peter Spengler said. AZ’s board of directors are recommending shareholders accept the offer. The directors have committed themselves to tender their own shares, representing approximately 0.7 percent of the total. Merck will fund the deal, plus about 240 million euros of debt, from existing cash reserves. It is conditional on the backing of 95 percent of AZ’s shareholders.

428,MRK,European shares continue to wobble amid taper worries,"* FTSEurofirst 300 down 0.1 pct, Euro STOXX 50 off 0.1 pct * Retailers Metro, Tesco hit by downgrades * Telecoms lower; Iliad’s 4G offers slammed * Merck rises after 1.6 bln stg deal for AZ electronics By David Brett LONDON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Retailers and telecoms led European shares lower on Thursday as recent strong economic data heightened worries over the potential for an early winding down of equity-friendly stimulus. Leading falling stocks was German retailer Metro, which shed 3.4 percent, a decline traders attributed to a Morgan Stanley downgrade to “equal-weight” from “overweight”. “We lower Metro to equal-weight given the share price breached our price target (36 euros) this week and we struggle to identify any near-term catalysts,” the bank said in a note. Retailers were the worst performing sector in Europe, hampered by a 1.8 percent fall in Tesco. The UK heavyweight extended recent declines as brokers and investment banks began to downgrade ratings and forecasts following Wednesday’s downbeat update. Telecoms too felt the pinch with France’s Iliad  down 3.5 percent after the French government slammed its low cost 4G offers. Telecom Italia was down more than 2 percent after the Brazilian antitrust watchdog urged Spain’s Telefonica  to exit its stake in Telecom Italia’s subsidiary TIM Brasil. A notable riser was Germany’s Merck, the world’s largest maker of liquid crystals for flat panel displays. It gained 3.2 percent after agreeing to buy Britain’s AZ Electronic Materials for about 1.6 billion pounds ($2.61 billion) in cash to diversify its offerings. Rebounding miners and banks, prevented the FTSEurofirst  from falling further, with the index down 1.23 points, or 0.1 percent, at 1272.36 points, testing support around the 1,278 level and heading lower for its fourth straight session. The euro zone blue chip index remained below 3,000 - a level it hadn’t reached since October - at 2,990.46 and tested support around 2,977 and 2,955. The FTSEurofirst is currently trading near six-week lows. Investors have been spooked by strong economic data, particularly in the United States, that has shortened odds for an early wind-down of the bond-buying stimulus that helped propel the index to five-year highs at the end of November. “Markets have fallen quite a bit in recent sessions on concerns that U.S. economic data has been coming in stronger than expected, prompting talk of bringing forward tapering,” said Jawaid Afsar, sales trader at SecurEquity. “On top of that, we have non-farm pay numbers tomorrow and the (Federal Reserve) meeting next week. Still quite a few headwinds.” Investors will keep a close eye on U.S. jobless benefits data for the week ended Nov. 30, and U.S. preliminary (second) GDP forecasts for the third quarter, both due out at 1330 GMT. A further improvement in the labour market could prompt the U.S. central bank to trim its stimulus sooner than expected, a negative scenario for equities, at least in the short-term. But Luca Paolini, chief Strategist at Pictet Asset Management said the asset class should continue to outperform despite the recent dip in equities. “An improvement in global economic conditions should eclipse concerns over the looming withdrawal of U.S. monetary stimulus, and lend support to equity markets heading into year-end, traditionally a favourable period for stocks.” The Bank of England and the European Central Bank are likely to hold off on any fresh policy action at their meetings on Thursday. The ECB’s new economic forecasts will be scrutinised for signs of prolonged price weakness that could lead it to act again next year, after recently cutting interest cuts in an attempt to kick-start the economy.

432,MRK,Merck agrees to proposed $27.7 million settlement over Fosamax lawsuits,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc said on Monday that it was prepared to pay $27.7 million to settle lawsuits by hundreds of people who sued the company over allegations that its osteoporosis drug Fosamax caused bones in the jaw to deteriorate. Lawyers for Merck and plaintiffs disclosed the proposed settlement at a court hearing in New York to resolve 1,140 lawsuits pending in federal and state courts. Any settlement would need to be approved by a judge. Merck, which confirmed the agreement later on Monday, said the accord requires a 100 percent participation rate and evidence that the claimants satisfy eligibility requirements. The deal covers about 1,200 people, the company said. “We hope to bring this to a successful conclusion,” Paul Strain, a lawyer for Merck, said at the hearing in U.S. District Court in Manhattan before Judge John Keenan, who has presided over federal litigation by plaintiffs claiming that they developed osteonecrosis of the jaw from taking Fosamax. The condition is a disease that causes bones in the jaw to deteriorate or die. The settlement would resolve a large portion of the 5,255 product liability cases facing Merck over Fosamax, a one-time blockbuster drug with $3 billion in sales in 2007. Sales have declined since Fosamax lost patent protection in 2008. Through September, Merck had reported $421 million in Fosamax sales in 2013. Of the lawsuits over Fosamax, about 860 of the cases were before Keenan. Since the cases were consolidated in 2006, Keenan has presided over all of the federal cases. The judge had held a series of “bellwether” trials, allowing Merck and plaintiffs’ lawyers to assess trends and outcomes in similar cases. The last Fosamax trial before Keenan resulted in a $285,000 verdict for plaintiff Rhoda Scheinberg in February. Merck lost just one other of the five bellwether trials when a jury awarded Florida resident Shirley Boles $8 million. The judge later cut that sum to $1.5 million. Merck won two other trials in a New Jersey state court over jaw injuries plaintiffs blamed Fosamax for. At Monday’s hearing, Timothy O’Brien, a plaintiffs’ lawyer with Levin, Papantonio, Thomas, Mitchell, Rafferty & Proctor, said that plaintiffs’ law firms had until January 13 to signify their intent to participate in the settlement process. Plaintiffs have until March 31 to opt-out of the settlement, the Merck lawyer, Strain, of law firm Venable said after Monday’s hearing. He said Merck has until May 15 to decide whether or not it will go forward with the deal. Merck said in a statement that the settlement does not cover the 4,115 lawsuits the company continues to face by people claiming to have sustained femur fractures or other bone injuries due to taking Fosamax. The case is In Re Fosamax Products Liability Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 06-md-01789.

435,MRK,Merck moves Alzheimer's drug into big trials after safety review,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co said it will begin two late-stage trials of its experimental Alzheimer’s drug, one of the industry’s best hopes for slowing the memory-robbing disease, after an independent monitoring board reviewed its safety and recommended that more patients be recruited for studies. The data monitoring committee gave its blessing to a Phase III trial involving up to 1,960 patients after examining interim safety data from a mid-stage trial of 200 patients who had been treated with the medicine, called MK-8931, for at least three months. The planned new study, called EPOCH, is expected to conclude in mid-2017, Merck said on Tuesday. The medicine works by blocking an enzyme called beta secretase that is involved in production of beta-amyloid, a protein that creates brain plaques considered a major cause of the progressive disease. Such medicines are known as BACE inhibitors. “There’s good reason to hope that a BACE inhibitor might help patients, and ours is the first to get the go-ahead for Phase III” trials, Darryle Schoepp, head of neuroscience at Merck, said in an interview. Merck will also begin a separate Phase III trial of the drug, involving 1,500 patients, in “prodromal” patients who do not yet have dementia. That study, called APECS, will enroll patients with mild cognitive problems and potential biomarkers for Alzheimer’s, such as elevated levels of beta amyloid in the brain and of beta amyloid and the protein tau in spinal fluid. They will be treated for two years. The trial is predicated on the theory that early intervention may be crucial, and that once dementia develops it may be too late to seriously arrest Alzheimer’s disease. “The prodromal trial is exciting because it may teach us whether we can prevent or slow down the onset of dementia,” Schoepp said. An estimated 5 million Americans have Alzheimer’s, the most common cause of dementia. More than 38 million people worldwide are believed to have dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease, and those numbers are expected to rise as more people live longer. Unlike heart disease and cancer, no major advancements have been seen in Alzheimer’s drug research since the first treatment was approved in 1993 by U.S. regulators. Current Alzheimer’s drugs, including Namenda from Forest Laboratories Inc and generic forms of Pfizer Inc’s Aricept (donepezil), can minimally and briefly help memory and ability to perform daily functions, but do not slow the disease. Oral drugs to block beta secretase have taken center stage after an injectable class of medicines, meant to remove beta amyloid plaque after it has already formed, failed or fell short last year in trials conducted by Pfizer Inc and Eli Lilly and Co. Safety of the new drugs became a major concern in June, when Lilly pulled the plug on its own BACE inhibitor due to liver toxicity. Merck, Johnson & Johnson, Roche Holding AG and Eisai Co Ltd are still in the race. Although data from Merck’s mid-stage trial of MK-8931 remains blinded, or secret, the data monitoring committee was allowed to examine the data for hints of safety issues. Its green light could help ease safety concerns over the emerging new class of medicines. The Merck drug in earlier trials cut production of a-beta peptide, the building block of beta amyloid plaque, by 79 percent, Schoepp said. “You’re turning off the faucet, shutting at its source the pathway that forms a-beta peptide,” said Schoepp. The toxic peptides clump together to form beta amyloid plaques in the brain that are a hallmark of the disease. J.P.Morgan analyst Chris Schott said expectations remained “low” for BACE inhibitors following the termination of Lilly’s product. But he said Merck’s drug could generate annual sales of more than $5 billion if it succeeds in trials and is approved. Merck shares slipped 0.4 percent to $49.35 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, amid moderate declines for the drug sector.

The data monitoring committee gave its blessing to a far larger trial involving almost 2,000 patients after examining interim safety data from a mid-stage trial of 200 patients who had been treated with the medicine, called MK-8931, for at least three months, Merck said. The medicine works by blocking an enzyme called BACE that is involved in the production of beta-amyloid, a protein that creates plaques in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease.

437,MRK,US FDA panel backs allergy drug of France's Stallergenes,"Dec 11 (Reuters) - An oral immunotherapy drug for treating grass pollen allergies was backed by an independent advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday. The drug, Oralair, made by France’s Stallergenes SA , is a tablet to be placed under the tongue and comprises extracts from five grass pollens mixed together - Kentucky bluegrass, Orchard, Perennial rye, Sweet vernal and Timothy. The advisory panel voted 9-1 that available data supported the drug’s efficacy in treating the allergy in patients five years of age or older. While the panel voted unanimously in favor of the drug’s safety in patients of 10 years to 65 years of age, it was divided about using the medicine in children, citing side effects. Panelists also expressed concerns about the drug’s use in asthmatic patients and in pregnant women and suggested conducting post-approval studies to test Oralair’s effects on these populations. While the FDA considers the recommendations of the advisory committee in deciding whether to approve a drug, it is not obligated to follow them. Oralair was first granted marketing approval in 2008 in Germany and is currently marketed in 16 countries. It is an immunotherapy that works by boosting the body’s immune system and making it less sensitive to allergens. Allergen-specific immunotherapies are ideal for patients whose symptoms are not adequately controlled by avoiding the allergens or by medicines, those suffering from allergy drug-related side effects, or who wish to reduce the long-term use of drugs. The committee will discuss another immunotherapy for allergy, Grastek, made by Merck & Co on Thursday.

443,MRK,UPDATE 1-Weak nausea drug data knocks back Tesaro shares,"(Adds details, background, stock movement) Dec 23 (Reuters) - Tesaro Inc’s experimental drug for treating chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) failed to show enough benefit in trials to give it an edge over competing drugs, sending its shares down as much as 24 percent. Merck & Co Inc’s Emend, a drug similar to Tesaro’s rolapitant, is approved to treat CINV and can help prevent it for up to 5 days from when chemotherapy is given. Two late-stage trials showed that while rolapitant was effective in treating CINV during the 24-120 hour period following chemotherapy, it failed to significantly improve patients’ condition during the first 24 hours. Rolapitant also did not show significant improvement after 120 hours of initiating chemotherapy. Rolapitant and Emend belong to the same class of drugs known as NK-1 receptor antagonists. These drugs work by blocking a substance in the brain that stimulates vomiting reflex. Patients in the trials either received a combination of two drugs to reduce the side effects of chemotherapy or rolapitant plus the two-drug combo. Merck’s drug is also used with the two-drug combination. The most frequently observed adverse events, including fatigue, alopecia and loss of appetite, were balanced across both the patient groups, Tesaro said in a statement. Tesaro said it continued to enroll patients in a third late-stage trial of the drug, and was preparing for a marketing approval application by mid-2014. Over 70 percent of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy suffer from nausea and vomiting that may result in a delay or discontinuation of treatment. Prolonged nausea and vomiting can also lead to weight loss, dehydration and malnutrition. Tesaro acquired the development and marketing rights to rolapitant from Opko Health Inc in December 2010 for up to $121 million, including up-front and milestone payments. Tesaro shares were down 20 percent at $30.11 in early trading on the Nasdaq.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration questioned the differences in size and formulation of the patch used in trials and the to-be-marketed patch. The generic drugs maker, which received a “complete response letter” from the FDA, said it planned to work closely with the agency to address the questions. Such letters typically lay out FDA concerns that need to be addressed before a treatment is approved. Actavis’ contraceptive skin patch is designed to provide continuous delivery of the hormone norethindrone, a type of progestin, during a once-weekly, seven-day dosing regimen. Progestin, the synthetic form of female sex hormone progestogen, inhibits ovulation and thickens the layer of mucus at the cervix so sperm cannot enter the uterus. The treatment will compete with Johnson and Johnson’s  Ortho Evra, an estrogen/progestin combination contraceptive patch. Estrogen is another female sex hormone. A progestin-only patch can be safer than combination patches as high levels of estrogen are often linked to blood clotting disorders and an increased risk of cancer. The company also filed on Tuesday an application to market the generic version of Merck & Co Inc’s NuvaRing, a estrogen/progestin combination hormonal contraceptive vaginal ring. Actavis said it may be the first applicant to file the application, which, if approved may entitle it to 180 days of generic market exclusivity.

445,MRK,"Special Report: Lost hooves, dead cattle before Merck halted Zilmax sales","WALLA WALLA COUNTY, WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. beef industry’s dependence on the muscle-building drug Zilmax began unraveling here, on a sweltering summer day, in the dusty cattle pens outside a Tyson Foods Inc slaughterhouse in southeastern Washington state. As cattle trailers that had traveled up to four hours in 95-degree heat began to unload, 15 heifers and steers hobbled down the ramps on August 5, barely able to walk. The reason: The animals had lost their hooves, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture documents reviewed by Reuters. The documents show the 15 animals were destroyed. The next day, the hottest day of the month, two more animals with missing hooves arrived by truck. Again, the animals were destroyed, the documents show. The animals’ feet were “basically coming apart,” said Keith Belk, a professor of animal science at Colorado State University. Belk said he reviewed photos of the lame cattle, though he declined to say who showed them to him. The 17 animals had a factor in common, according to an examination of U.S. government documents and interviews with people who had direct knowledge of the events. In the weeks before the cattle were shipped to Tyson’s slaughterhouse, outside the city limits of Pasco, all had been fed Merck & Co Inc’s profit-enhancing animal feed additive, Zilmax. The day after the hoofless animals were euthanized on August 6, Tyson told its feedlot customers it would stop accepting Zilmax-fed cattle. After Reuters reported the existence of a videotape of apparently lame Zilmax-fed animals - shown by an official of meatpacking giant JBS USA LLC at a trade meeting in Colorado - Merck itself temporarily suspended sales of the drug in the U.S. and Canada. The rest of the nation’s leading meatpackers soon followed Tyson, the largest U.S. meat processor. Merck, in a statement to Reuters, stressed the safety of its product. It said the company investigates all reports of adverse reactions to its drugs, and did so after the deaths near Pasco. “Several third-party experts were brought in to evaluate the situation, review the data and identify potential causes for the hoof issue,” Merck’s statement said. “The findings from the investigation showed that the hoof loss was not due to the fact these animals had received Zilmax.” Merck declined to identify the names of the third-party investigators or provide more detail on the research findings. After temporarily halting Zilmax sales, Merck continues to state Zilmax is safe when used as directed, with no welfare concerns discovered in 30 research studies since the product was introduced in the United States in 2007. In addition, Merck said, the company is planning more field evaluations of Zilmax, using “a well-designed collection and analysis of data by third-party industry experts.” A “prominent” epidemiologist and veterinarian will oversee the work, Merck said. Tyson Foods spokesman Gary Mickelson said his company doesn’t know exactly what happened to the small group of cattle that were destroyed at the plant near Pasco. Some animal health experts have told Tyson the use of Zilmax is a possible cause, he said. Tyson had seen some cattle mobility issues in the past, but “the issues at Pasco this summer were more severe” than the company had seen before, Mickelson said. Scientists say they have yet to determine whether Zilmax causes ailments so severe that cattle must be euthanized. One theory is that the federally approved feed additive may compound the effects of common feedlot nutritional disorders such as acidosis, which can affect animals that consume too much starch (primarily grain) or sugar in a short period of time. Heat and animal genetics, too, may be factors. Regardless, the episode at the Tyson plant - which hasn’t been publicly disclosed until now - is coming to light at a time of growing concern over risks to animal and human health posed by the increased use of pharmaceuticals in food production. Livestock pharmaceuticals use is expanding as part of the push to produce more meat at lower cost. Earlier this month, in an effort to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria that threatens human health, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration rolled out new policies to phase out the use of antibiotics that make cows, pigs and chickens plumper. The FDA has said that meat produced from cattle fed with Zilmax is safe for human consumption. The cases of hoofless cattle also raise ethical questions about whether the drive by modern agriculture to produce greater volumes of food, as cheaply as possible, is coming at the cost of animal welfare. Of the more than 30 million beef cattle slaughtered in the U.S. annually, most move smoothly through a mechanized system that is among the most efficient in the world. Reports that Zilmax causes lameness in some animals have raised concerns about the tradeoffs associated with a drug that adds up to 33 pounds of marketable meat to a 1,300-pound steer and has helped some feedlots stay in business at a time of punishing industry consolidation. Livestock nutritionists, veterinarians and cattle researchers told Reuters that cattle losing hooves would be in great pain. Animals that have lost their hooves may take tentative steps, as if walking on glass, they said. Even when prodded, they sometimes refuse to rise back to their feet. Livestock researcher Temple Grandin, who has pioneered humane slaughterhouse practices as a consultant to major beef processors, said it would be like a person having their toe nails yanked off. “It would hurt a whole lot,” said Grandin, who said she has not witnessed any of the incidents of Zilmax-fed cattle with lost hooves. When animals delivered to slaughterhouses are unable to walk on their own, Agriculture Department regulations require such “downer” cattle be destroyed and their meat prevented from reaching consumers. Federal law requires Merck to report all animal deaths, as well as any other adverse reactions, in connection with use of its products. A review of reports submitted by Merck and others to the FDA shows at least 285 cattle have died unexpectedly or been destroyed in the United States after being fed Zilmax since the drug was introduced in 2007. The FDA reports specify the ailments that led to the unexpected deaths, but do not consistently state whether the animals expired on their own or were euthanized. According to the reports, reviewed by Reuters through a Freedom of Information Act request, at least 75 animals lost hooves and were euthanized after being fed Zilmax over the past two years. The reports show pneumonia was a factor in the death of 94 Zilmax-fed cattle. And a build-up of gas in bovine stomachs, referred to as bloat, was listed as a cause in 41 cases of cattle fed Zilmax. Of the 285 animals that died, 113 were fed either an animal-based antibiotic, or another medication to boost weight, or both, in conjunction with Zilmax. Some veterinarians and animal experts say there is no proof Zilmax was the chief cause of any cattle deaths. “My assessment is that I do not see data supporting the concerns today, at least the data that I have reviewed and been aware of,” said University of Nebraska-Lincoln animal science professor Galen Erickson, in response to questions from Reuters about Zilmax’s safety. But some previously staunch supporters of Merck’s innovative growth drug are beginning to question the product’s safety record. “Maybe we found the point where we pushed the cattle just so hard in the sake of making a buck that we exceeded the biological limits of the cattle,” said Abe Turgeon, a prominent livestock nutritionist, who had previously recommended Zilmax to some customers. Merck Animal Health, the unit that markets the additive, said proper use of Zilmax “does not affect the safety or well-being of cattle.” Moving beyond the 30 studies it cited at the time it suspended Zilmax sales, Merck in August launched an audit of how the product was being used in the field, created an advisory board to review management practices in the feedlot and animal nutrition industries, and provided new funds for field research on Zilmax-fed cattle. Today, the company has said it plans to reintroduce Zilmax, but noted it is too soon to know when sales to U.S. and Canadian customers may resume. Merck has begun approaching cattle nutritionists, livestock academics and other professionals who influence opinion in an effort to gain industry insight and win support for the return of the drug, according to several people who have met with the company. The FDA regulates livestock feed additives sold in the United States, and is charged with intervening when a pharmaceutical product it has approved causes harm when used as directed. The agency said it has taken no action related to Zilmax. When asked for comment about the adverse-event reports filed by Merck, an FDA spokeswoman in a statement said the agency “has not reached any conclusions on the safety of Zilmax but the agency is continuing to receive and evaluate data. As part of this process, the agency is always interested in new information.” The Merck suspension of Zilmax sales is voluntary, and at this point the company could return Zilmax to the market without seeking permission from the FDA. Zilmax is a medicated feed supplement for beef cattle that belongs to a class of drugs known as beta-agonists, which are also used in humans to ease asthma symptoms. Zilmax, with its active ingredient zilpaterol hydrochloride, is a federally approved weight-gaining supplement. It is added to cattle feed in the weeks before slaughter to add extra pounds of profit-producing meat. Zilmax was worth nearly $160 million in annual sales in the United States and Canada last year, and was a steady cash generator for Merck’s animal health business, which has about $3.3 billion in global sales. The additive served as a go-to solution for a troubled cattle industry, as one-fifth of the nation’s feedlots went out of business over the last decade. With cattle herds in sharp decline, Zilmax worked along with improved animal genetics and feed to produce more meat with fewer animals. The United States produced nearly 26 billion pounds of beef from a herd of 91 million cattle in 2012, according to USDA data. In 1975, when the nation’s cattle herd hit a peak of 135 million head, the industry produced nearly 24 billion pounds of beef. Last month, beef cattle walking into a U.S. packing plant on average weighed a record 1,346 pounds — up more than 20 percent in the last two decades. Merck’s Zilmax quickly developed a loyal customer base. Its popularity spread even to the show circuit, where ranchers’ children today can win prizes exceeding $100,000 for raising big-girth bovines. Tyson and rival beef processor Cargill Inc have told Reuters they will not accept Zilmax-fed cattle until Merck can provide a scientific vetting of Zilmax’s safety to animals and the companies are confident any animal welfare issues are resolved. (Cargill says it didn’t see the cattle lameness problems cited by JBS and Tyson.) Both companies, too, have cited concerns about China and other nations that have barred the importation of meat produced from Zilmax-fed cattle. They fear that if such meat is accidentally sent to these countries, it could hurt their export businesses. FDA records based on 59 adverse event reports filed since 2008 by Merck and Intervet Inc - the original developer of Zilmax before Merck acquired the firm in 2009 - chronicle incidents of Zilmax-fed cattle experiencing stomach ulcers, brain lesions and blindness. Merck also has reported incidents of Zilmax-fed animals showing signs of lethargy, bloody noses, respiratory problems and heart failure. In September 2011, an unidentified veterinarian at an Oregon feedlot reported “unusual hoof loss in cattle being fed Zilmax,” according to one adverse event report reviewed by Reuters. In August this year, Merck reported an additional five episodes involving 66 cattle in Oregon and Idaho that lost their hooves after a Zilmax feeding regimen. In some cases, a consulting veterinarian also cited high ambient temperature and a cement-and-rebar floor that may have exacerbated the hoof damage. Also in August, one Nebraska cattle producer, who is not named in the FDA documents, reported he had more dead cattle when he used Zilmax than when he didn’t, according to the documents. A Reuters review of data kept by the U.S. Agriculture Department show that euthanizations of cattle have risen substantially since Zilmax came on the market. In the two years after Zilmax was introduced, the number of beef steers and heifers euthanized prior to slaughter at U.S. packing plants rose nearly 175 percent from previous levels. The number of euthanized steers and heifers has ranged between 1,600 and 2,300 cattle each year since then. That new plateau is well above the average of 670 a year in the four years before Zilmax came on the market in 2007. The government data does not, though, draw a link between Zilmax or any other possible factors and the increase in euthanized cattle at meatpacking plants. The number of euthanized cattle and the other reports of cattle dying is also quite small relative to the more than 30 million cattle slaughtered each year. It is small enough that it likely hasn’t raised significant red flags with the FDA, said David Acheson, the agency’s former Associate Commissioner for Food. “I suspect that that’s not going to trigger them to do much,” Acheson said. Tyson’s plant, about 14 miles southeast of Pasco, is an integrated modern-day packing operation, stretching the length of several football fields. Five days a week, more than 1,300 workers arrive and walk past security guards toward a mechanical rumble emanating from the plant’s gunmetal gray walls. Tyson acquired the operation, one of its smaller plants, in 2001. It processes roughly 2,000 cattle a day, according to workers and local residents. Tyson would not comment on the number. Washington state lies in the Pacific Northwest, with its soaring mountains and chilly rain. But the eastern flatlands around Pasco more closely resemble the Southwest’s desert - and sometimes share its soaring summer temperatures. To guard against the heat, Tyson has provided cover or shade for some holding pens at the plant. Overhead sprinkler systems help cool the cattle, too. But 2013 saw one of the hottest summers in a quarter century, with at least three heat waves in which temperatures in the area topped 100 degrees, according to National Climatic Data Center. Temperatures were spiking on many of the dates when a total of 37 cattle were euthanized this summer due to lameness associated with Zilmax. According to USDA documents and people knowledgeable about the events, some of the animals were shipped from Beef Northwest of North Powder, Oregon. On August 5, of 17 cattle that were euthanized at Tyson’s plant, the USDA inspector who condemned the animals noted that 15 had “lost toes.” Two were destroyed for other reasons. The inspector identified at least one of the animals in the group that was put down as a heifer originating from Nyssa, Oregon. Beef Northwest operates a feedlot in Nyssa. Animals making the trip to Pasco would have stood in a trailer for four hours on a 95-degree day as it traveled to Tyson’s plant. John Wilson, managing partner of Beef Northwest, confirmed that his company was using a Zilmax feed regimen this summer. About 40 of Beef Northwest’s animals “developed lameness after arriving at a packing plant in two incidents in July and August of this year,” he said. Wilson declined to identify the slaughterhouse and would not confirm the animals were destroyed. Wilson said Beef Northwest had never faced lameness problems with its Zilmax-fed animals before this summer. While Beef Northwest was dispensing Zilmax, Wilson said, the company strictly followed Merck’s dosage and other instructions. Beef Northwest says it frequently conducted internal and third-party audits to ensure employees were not over-feeding Zilmax to the animals. “In our cases, dosages were not an issue, never an issue,” Wilson said in a phone interview. “I’d like to think that we were on the upper edge of the industry as far as heavy oversight of all of our protocols.” BELIEVERS AND NON-BELIEVERS As feed-grain prices soared amid strong demand among livestock and ethanol producers in recent years, and with drought ravaging the U.S. crop belt, Zilmax seemed like an attractive solution. Some feedlot owners nicknamed it “Vitamin Z.” “We couldn’t find feed cheap enough to make any money” on raising cattle, said Turgeon, the cattle nutritionist who works with Beef Northwest. Many clients had adopted another beta-agonist - Optaflexx, made by Eli Lilly and Co’s Elanco Animal Health unit. Elanco is Merck’s biggest rival in the animal health business. The two products use different active ingredients: Optaflexx is based on ractopamine, while Zilmax uses zilpaterol. But Zilmax added more weight to cattle than Optaflexx did, say industry nutritionists and feedlot owners. That perceived advantage helped Zilmax gain market share and sales faster than Optaflexx in recent years, say industry experts. Turgeon had heard from his customers about lameness problems associated with Zilmax, and a colleague this summer showed him photos of animals with hooves peeling off, he said. Reuters has not seen any photos of cattle with missing hooves. Merck is now trying to win the industry back. At a closed-door session of an Academy of Veterinary Consultants conference in Denver on December 5, some 300 cattle veterinarians sparred over Zilmax. During the debate, they broke into informal camps of “believers” who think Zilmax hurts cattle, and “disbelievers” who discount its negative effects, according to Larry Moczygemba, president of the academy. The veterinarians debated the effects of Zilmax and other beta-agonist drugs, Moczygemba said, without reaching a conclusion. Merck employees stayed in the room, mostly remaining silent. “Few, if any, think this is just a beta-agonist problem all on its own,” Moczygemba said. “But our role as vets puts animal well being first.” ",12302013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-zilmax-merck-cattle-special-report/special-report-lost-hooves-dead-cattle-before-merck-halted-zilmax-sales-idUSBRE9BT0NV20131230
446,MRK,"SPECIAL REPORT-Lost hooves, dead cattle before Merck halted Zilmax sales","(For more Reuters Special Reports, double-click on ) By P.J. Huffstutter and Tom Polansek WALLA WALLA COUNTY, WASHINGTON, Dec 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. beef industry’s dependence on the muscle-building drug Zilmax began unraveling here, on a sweltering summer day, in the dusty cattle pens outside a Tyson Foods Inc slaughterhouse in southeastern Washington state. As cattle trailers that had traveled up to four hours in 95-degree heat began to unload, 15 heifers and steers hobbled down the ramps on August 5, barely able to walk. The reason: The animals had lost their hooves, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture documents reviewed by Reuters. The documents show the 15 animals were destroyed. The next day, the hottest day of the month, two more animals with missing hooves arrived by truck. Again, the animals were destroyed, the documents show. The animals’ feet were “basically coming apart,” said Keith Belk, a professor of animal science at Colorado State University. Belk said he reviewed photos of the lame cattle, though he declined to say who showed them to him. The 17 animals had a factor in common, according to an examination of U.S. government documents and interviews with people who had direct knowledge of the events. In the weeks before the cattle were shipped to Tyson’s slaughterhouse, outside the city limits of Pasco, all had been fed Merck & Co Inc’s profit-enhancing animal feed additive, Zilmax. The day after the hoofless animals were euthanized on August 6, Tyson told its feedlot customers it would stop accepting Zilmax-fed cattle. After Reuters reported the existence of a videotape of apparently lame Zilmax-fed animals - shown by an official of meatpacking giant JBS USA LLC at a trade meeting in Colorado - Merck itself temporarily suspended sales of the drug in the U.S. and Canada. The rest of the nation’s leading meatpackers soon followed Tyson, the largest U.S. meat processor. Merck, in a statement to Reuters, stressed the safety of its product. It said the company investigates all reports of adverse reactions to its drugs, and did so after the deaths near Pasco. “Several third-party experts were brought in to evaluate the situation, review the data and identify potential causes for the hoof issue,” Merck’s statement said. “The findings from the investigation showed that the hoof loss was not due to the fact these animals had received Zilmax.” Merck declined to identify the names of the third-party investigators or provide more detail on the research findings. After temporarily halting Zilmax sales, Merck continues to state Zilmax is safe when used as directed, with no welfare concerns discovered in 30 research studies since the product was introduced in the United States in 2007. In addition, Merck said, the company is planning more field evaluations of Zilmax, using “a well-designed collection and analysis of data by third-party industry experts.” A “prominent” epidemiologist and veterinarian will oversee the work, Merck said. Tyson Foods spokesman Gary Mickelson said his company doesn’t know exactly what happened to the small group of cattle that were destroyed at the plant near Pasco. Some animal health experts have told Tyson the use of Zilmax is a possible cause, he said. Tyson had seen some cattle mobility issues in the past, but “the issues at Pasco this summer were more severe” than the company had seen before, Mickelson said. Scientists say they have yet to determine whether Zilmax causes ailments so severe that cattle must be euthanized. One theory is that the federally approved feed additive may compound the effects of common feedlot nutritional disorders such as acidosis, which can affect animals that consume too much starch (primarily grain) or sugar in a short period of time. Heat and animal genetics, too, may be factors. Regardless, the episode at the Tyson plant - which hasn’t been publicly disclosed until now - is coming to light at a time of growing concern over risks to animal and human health posed by the increased use of pharmaceuticals in food production. Livestock pharmaceuticals use is expanding as part of the push to produce more meat at lower cost. Earlier this month, in an effort to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria that threatens human health, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration rolled out new policies to phase out the use of antibiotics that make cows, pigs and chickens plumper. The FDA has said that meat produced from cattle fed with Zilmax is safe for human consumption. The cases of hoofless cattle also raise ethical questions about whether the drive by modern agriculture to produce greater volumes of food, as cheaply as possible, is coming at the cost of animal welfare. Of the more than 30 million beef cattle slaughtered in the U.S. annually, most move smoothly through a mechanized system that is among the most efficient in the world. Reports that Zilmax causes lameness in some animals have raised concerns about the tradeoffs associated with a drug that adds up to 33 pounds of marketable meat to a 1,300-pound steer and has helped some feedlots stay in business at a time of punishing industry consolidation. Livestock nutritionists, veterinarians and cattle researchers told Reuters that cattle losing hooves would be in great pain. Animals that have lost their hooves may take tentative steps, as if walking on glass, they said. Even when prodded, they sometimes refuse to rise back to their feet. Livestock researcher Temple Grandin, who has pioneered humane slaughterhouse practices as a consultant to major beef processors, said it would be like a person having their toe nails yanked off. “It would hurt a whole lot,” said Grandin, who said she has not witnessed any of the incidents of Zilmax-fed cattle with lost hooves. When animals delivered to slaughterhouses are unable to walk on their own, Agriculture Department regulations require such “downer” cattle be destroyed and their meat prevented from reaching consumers. Federal law requires Merck to report all animal deaths, as well as any other adverse reactions, in connection with use of its products. A review of reports submitted by Merck and others to the FDA shows at least 285 cattle have died unexpectedly or been destroyed in the United States after being fed Zilmax since the drug was introduced in 2007. The FDA reports specify the ailments that led to the unexpected deaths, but do not consistently state whether the animals expired on their own or were euthanized. According to the reports, reviewed by Reuters through a Freedom of Information Act request, at least 75 animals lost hooves and were euthanized after being fed Zilmax over the past two years. The reports show pneumonia was a factor in the death of 94 Zilmax-fed cattle. And a build-up of gas in bovine stomachs, referred to as bloat, was listed as a cause in 41 cases of cattle fed Zilmax. Of the 285 animals that died, 113 were fed either an animal-based antibiotic, or another medication to boost weight, or both, in conjunction with Zilmax. Some veterinarians and animal experts say there is no proof Zilmax was the chief cause of any cattle deaths. “My assessment is that I do not see data supporting the concerns today, at least the data that I have reviewed and been aware of,” said University of Nebraska-Lincoln animal science professor Galen Erickson, in response to questions from Reuters about Zilmax’s safety. But some previously staunch supporters of Merck’s innovative growth drug are beginning to question the product’s safety record. “Maybe we found the point where we pushed the cattle just so hard in the sake of making a buck that we exceeded the biological limits of the cattle,” said Abe Turgeon, a prominent livestock nutritionist, who had previously recommended Zilmax to some customers. Merck Animal Health, the unit that markets the additive, said proper use of Zilmax “does not affect the safety or well-being of cattle.” Moving beyond the 30 studies it cited at the time it suspended Zilmax sales, Merck in August launched an audit of how the product was being used in the field, created an advisory board to review management practices in the feedlot and animal nutrition industries, and provided new funds for field research on Zilmax-fed cattle. Today, the company has said it plans to reintroduce Zilmax, but noted it is too soon to know when sales to U.S. and Canadian customers may resume. Merck has begun approaching cattle nutritionists, livestock academics and other professionals who influence opinion in an effort to gain industry insight and win support for the return of the drug, according to several people who have met with the company. The FDA regulates livestock feed additives sold in the United States, and is charged with intervening when a pharmaceutical product it has approved causes harm when used as directed. The agency said it has taken no action related to Zilmax. When asked for comment about the adverse-event reports filed by Merck, an FDA spokeswoman in a statement said the agency “has not reached any conclusions on the safety of Zilmax but the agency is continuing to receive and evaluate data. As part of this process, the agency is always interested in new information.” The Merck suspension of Zilmax sales is voluntary, and at this point the company could return Zilmax to the market without seeking permission from the FDA. Zilmax is a medicated feed supplement for beef cattle that belongs to a class of drugs known as beta-agonists, which are also used in humans to ease asthma symptoms. Zilmax, with its active ingredient zilpaterol hydrochloride, is a federally approved weight-gaining supplement. It is added to cattle feed in the weeks before slaughter to add extra pounds of profit-producing meat. Zilmax was worth nearly $160 million in annual sales in the United States and Canada last year, and was a steady cash generator for Merck’s animal health business, which has about $3.3 billion in global sales. The additive served as a go-to solution for a troubled cattle industry, as one-fifth of the nation’s feedlots went out of business over the last decade. With cattle herds in sharp decline, Zilmax worked along with improved animal genetics and feed to produce more meat with fewer animals. The United States produced nearly 26 billion pounds of beef from a herd of 91 million cattle in 2012, according to USDA data. In 1975, when the nation’s cattle herd hit a peak of 135 million head, the industry produced nearly 24 billion pounds of beef. Last month, beef cattle walking into a U.S. packing plant on average weighed a record 1,346 pounds - up more than 20 percent in the last two decades. Merck’s Zilmax quickly developed a loyal customer base. Its popularity spread even to the show circuit, where ranchers’ children today can win prizes exceeding $100,000 for raising big-girth bovines. Tyson and rival beef processor Cargill Inc have told Reuters they will not accept Zilmax-fed cattle until Merck can provide a scientific vetting of Zilmax’s safety to animals and the companies are confident any animal welfare issues are resolved. (Cargill says it didn’t see the cattle lameness problems cited by JBS and Tyson.) Both companies, too, have cited concerns about China and other nations that have barred the importation of meat produced from Zilmax-fed cattle. They fear that if such meat is accidentally sent to these countries, it could hurt their export businesses. FDA records based on 59 adverse event reports filed since 2008 by Merck and Intervet Inc - the original developer of Zilmax before Merck acquired the firm in 2009 - chronicle incidents of Zilmax-fed cattle experiencing stomach ulcers, brain lesions and blindness. Merck also has reported incidents of Zilmax-fed animals showing signs of lethargy, bloody noses, respiratory problems and heart failure. In September 2011, an unidentified veterinarian at an Oregon feedlot reported “unusual hoof loss in cattle being fed Zilmax,” according to one adverse event report reviewed by Reuters. In August this year, Merck reported an additional five episodes involving 66 cattle in Oregon and Idaho that lost their hooves after a Zilmax feeding regimen. In some cases, a consulting veterinarian also cited high ambient temperature and a cement-and-rebar floor that may have exacerbated the hoof damage. Also in August, one Nebraska cattle producer, who is not named in the FDA documents, reported he had more dead cattle when he used Zilmax than when he didn’t, according to the documents. A Reuters review of data kept by the U.S. Agriculture Department show that euthanizations of cattle have risen substantially since Zilmax came on the market. In the two years after Zilmax was introduced, the number of beef steers and heifers euthanized prior to slaughter at U.S. packing plants rose nearly 175 percent from previous levels. The number of euthanized steers and heifers has ranged between 1,600 and 2,300 cattle each year since then. That new plateau is well above the average of 670 a year in the four years before Zilmax came on the market in 2007. The government data does not, though, draw a link between Zilmax or any other possible factors and the increase in euthanized cattle at meatpacking plants. The number of euthanized cattle and the other reports of cattle dying is also quite small relative to the more than 30 million cattle slaughtered each year. It is small enough that it likely hasn’t raised significant red flags with the FDA, said David Acheson, the agency’s former Associate Commissioner for Food. “I suspect that that’s not going to trigger them to do much,” Acheson said. Tyson’s plant, about 14 miles southeast of Pasco, is an integrated modern-day packing operation, stretching the length of several football fields. Five days a week, more than 1,300 workers arrive and walk past security guards toward a mechanical rumble emanating from the plant’s gunmetal gray walls. Tyson acquired the operation, one of its smaller plants, in 2001. It processes roughly 2,000 cattle a day, according to workers and local residents. Tyson would not comment on the number. Washington state lies in the Pacific Northwest, with its soaring mountains and chilly rain. But the eastern flatlands around Pasco more closely resemble the Southwest’s desert - and sometimes share its soaring summer temperatures. To guard against the heat, Tyson has provided cover or shade for some holding pens at the plant. Overhead sprinkler systems help cool the cattle, too.

The number of euthanized cattle and the other reports of cattle dying is also quite small relative to the more than 30 million cattle slaughtered each year. It is small enough that it likely hasn’t raised significant red flags with the FDA, said David Acheson, the agency’s former Associate Commissioner for Food. “I suspect that that’s not going to trigger them to do much,” Acheson said. Tyson’s plant, about 14 miles southeast of Pasco, is an integrated modern-day packing operation, stretching the length of several football fields. Five days a week, more than 1,300 workers arrive and walk past security guards toward a mechanical rumble emanating from the plant’s gunmetal gray walls. Tyson acquired the operation, one of its smaller plants, in 2001. It processes roughly 2,000 cattle a day, according to workers and local residents. Tyson would not comment on the number. Washington state lies in the Pacific Northwest, with its soaring mountains and chilly rain. But the eastern flatlands around Pasco more closely resemble the Southwest’s desert - and sometimes share its soaring summer temperatures. To guard against the heat, Tyson has provided cover or shade for some holding pens at the plant. Overhead sprinkler systems help cool the cattle, too. But 2013 saw one of the hottest summers in a quarter century, with at least three heat waves in which temperatures in the area topped 100 degrees, according to National Climatic Data Center. Temperatures were spiking on many of the dates when a total of 37 cattle were euthanized this summer due to lameness associated with Zilmax. According to USDA documents and people knowledgeable about the events, some of the animals were shipped from Beef Northwest of North Powder, Oregon. On August 5, of 17 cattle that were euthanized at Tyson’s plant, the USDA inspector who condemned the animals noted that 15 had “lost toes.” Two were destroyed for other reasons. The inspector identified at least one of the animals in the group that was put down as a heifer originating from Nyssa, Oregon. Beef Northwest operates a feedlot in Nyssa. Animals making the trip to Pasco would have stood in a trailer for four hours on a 95-degree day as it traveled to Tyson’s plant. John Wilson, managing partner of Beef Northwest, confirmed that his company was using a Zilmax feed regimen this summer. About 40 of Beef Northwest’s animals “developed lameness after arriving at a packing plant in two incidents in July and August of this year,” he said. Wilson declined to identify the slaughterhouse and would not confirm the animals were destroyed. Wilson said Beef Northwest had never faced lameness problems with its Zilmax-fed animals before this summer. While Beef Northwest was dispensing Zilmax, Wilson said, the company strictly followed Merck’s dosage and other instructions. Beef Northwest says it frequently conducted internal and third-party audits to ensure employees were not over-feeding Zilmax to the animals. “In our cases, dosages were not an issue, never an issue,” Wilson said in a phone interview. “I’d like to think that we were on the upper edge of the industry as far as heavy oversight of all of our protocols.” BELIEVERS AND NON-BELIEVERS As feed-grain prices soared amid strong demand among livestock and ethanol producers in recent years, and with drought ravaging the U.S. crop belt, Zilmax seemed like an attractive solution. Some feedlot owners nicknamed it “Vitamin Z.” “We couldn’t find feed cheap enough to make any money” on raising cattle, said Turgeon, the cattle nutritionist who works with Beef Northwest. Many clients had adopted another beta-agonist - Optaflexx, made by Eli Lilly and Co’s Elanco Animal Health unit. Elanco is Merck’s biggest rival in the animal health business. The two products use different active ingredients: Optaflexx is based on ractopamine, while Zilmax uses zilpaterol. But Zilmax added more weight to cattle than Optaflexx did, say industry nutritionists and feedlot owners. That perceived advantage helped Zilmax gain market share and sales faster than Optaflexx in recent years, say industry experts. Turgeon had heard from his customers about lameness problems associated with Zilmax, and a colleague this summer showed him photos of animals with hooves peeling off, he said. Reuters has not seen any photos of cattle with missing hooves. Merck is now trying to win the industry back. At a closed-door session of an Academy of Veterinary Consultants conference in Denver on December 5, some 300 cattle veterinarians sparred over Zilmax. During the debate, they broke into informal camps of “believers” who think Zilmax hurts cattle, and “disbelievers” who discount its negative effects, according to Larry Moczygemba, president of the academy. The veterinarians debated the effects of Zilmax and other beta-agonist drugs, Moczygemba said, without reaching a conclusion. Merck employees stayed in the room, mostly remaining silent. “Few, if any, think this is just a beta-agonist problem all on its own,” Moczygemba said. “But our role as vets puts animal well being first.” ",12312013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-zilmax-merck-cattle-special-report/special-report-lost-hooves-dead-cattle-before-merck-halted-zilmax-sales-idUSBRE9BT0NV20131231
448,MRK,Novartis and Merck discuss earnings-boosting asset swap,"LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Novartis AG NOVN.VX is discussing swapping its animal health and human vaccines businesses for Merck & Co Inc’s (MRK.N) over-the-counter products unit in a deal that could boost earnings at both companies. Healthcare bankers said an asset swap with Merck was the main focus for the Swiss drugmaker as it reviews its portfolio, although an outright sale of animal health or an exchange with other companies were still possible. One of the bankers said Novartis and Merck had been in talks for some time but asset swaps were hard to execute, due to the difficulty of comparing the relative attraction of different businesses. If the hoped-for swap with Merck does not work out, Novartis is likely to opt for a sale or swap with another leading animal health firm, such as Bayer (BAYGn.DE), Zoetis (ZTS.N), Sanofi (SASY.PA), Eli Lilly (LLY.N) or unlisted Boehringer Ingelheim. Bloomberg reported earlier that Novartis and Merck might each trade about $5 billion in assets under an eventual deal. Sources with knowledge of the matter had told Reuters last month that Novartis was ready to sell its animal health unit and had opened its books to Bayer and others for the business that could change hands for more than 3 billion euros ($4.1 billion). New chairman Joerg Reinhardt is casting a fresh eye over the Basel-based group following the departure of veteran chairman and one-time CEO Daniel Vasella, the architect of the merger of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz that created Novartis in 1996. Reinhardt has defended the firm’s diversified strategy, but has stressed Novartis will only hang on to businesses that are among world leaders. That has left uncertain the future of sub-scale operations like animal health and vaccines. Novartis already agreed to sell its blood transfusion testing unit to Spain’s Grifols (GRLS.MC) for $1.7 billion in November. Merck, meanwhile, has been saying for some time that its over-the-counter (OTC) consumer health business lacks scale and Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said a swap could boost earnings per share at both companies by around 3 percent. Merck’s OTC line-up would add products such as Claritin medicine for allergies, Coppertone sunblock and Dr Scholl’s foot care, boosting Novartis’s already strong consumer care portfolio. Analysts said Merck’s products would fit well within the Novartis OTC business, since it is currently dominated by remedies for coughs, colds and pain. The Novartis animal health products include Sentinel and Prac-tic flea and tick treatments for dogs, as well as a range of other products for pets and farm animals, while its human vaccines operation mainly makes flu shots. Many drugmakers are currently shedding businesses, prompted by pricing pressures and increasing competition from generics that has forced a more rigorous approach to capital allocation. As part of that they are also showing a new willingness to consider whether other companies may be better owners for certain assets, thereby unlocking value for shareholders. Pfizer (PFE.N), for example, has already spun out its animal health operations into Zoetis and sold its infant nutrition business to Nestle NESN.VX.

451,MRK,Merck shares jump on early filing for skin cancer drug,"(Reuters) - Shares of Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) rose as much as 6.5 percent Monday after it filed the first part of an application to market its experimental drug, MK-3475, for advanced melanoma, putting the treatment on track to become the first in a new class of promising cancer drugs to reach the market. The application was filed earlier than investors had expected and ups the ante in a race between Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co(BMY.N) for dominance of a class of drugs known as anti-PD-1 inhibitors that are expected to generate billions of dollars in peak sales. Merck’s drug is designed to treat patients with advanced melanoma who have previously been treated with Bristol-Myers’ melanoma drug Yervoy. The company is also testing the drug in other cancers, including lung and renal cancer. Bristol is testing its own PD-1 drug nivolumab in a variety of cancers, with lung cancer likely to be one of the first to move forward. “This is probably one of the most important classes of new drug,” said Damien Conover, an analyst at Morningstar, who forecasts peak sales for Merck’s drug, including multiple cancer indications, of $3 billion. He forecasts peak sales for Bristol’s drug of $6 billion. The drugs are designed to restore the natural ability of the immune system to recognize and target cancer cells. While Bristol has more clinical trials and data to show for nivolumab, Merck’s move in filing for MK-3475 early “is a way to fight Bristol by getting out ahead of them,” Conover said. Merck said it expects to complete its application in the first half of this year. Under a rolling application, completed portions of the package may be submitted and reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration on an ongoing basis. Jeffrey Holford, an analyst at Jefferies, said in a research note that the future of PD-1 development could focus on combination regimens. He said it is too early to decide on a winner in the PD-1 space, though he said Merck’s drug “does appear to have the best overall profile as a monotherapy.” Merck also benefited from other news on Monday. The company said it is pursuing strategic options for its animal health and consumer businesses and expects to complete any action it takes this year. It previously said it was looking at options for separating the businesses but the company’s statement reinforces the likelihood something will in fact occur. Separately, a preliminary review of Merck’s experimental blood clot-preventing drug vorapaxar by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration found clinical trial data to be “robustly positive” and recommended the drug be approved in patients who have previously suffered a heart attack.

456,MRK,Merck's anti-blood clot drug should be approved: FDA review,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc’s experimental blood clot-preventing drug vorapaxar should be approved, based on “robustly positive” clinical trial results, according to a preliminary review of the data by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The review, posted on the FDA’s website on Monday, comes two days ahead of a meeting of outside medical experts who are expected to recommend whether it should be approved. The FDA usually follows the advice of its advisory panels. The drug, which would be sold under the brand name Zontivity, is designed to prevent heart-related deaths, cardiac arrests and strokes in patients who have had a recent heart attack. It would not be recommended for patients who have previously had a stroke because of an increased risk of bleeding in the brain. Results from a trial known as TRA 2P “are sufficient to establish the effectiveness of vorapaxar for its proposed indication,” the review found. The main safety concern with the drug is bleeding, the review found, though it noted that the rate of fatal bleeding was low in the population for whom the drug is proposed. The FDA did not recommend that the company establish a risk management program, nor did it recommend that the company conduct additional trials following approval. Vorapaxar works by preventing blood cells, known as platelets, from clumping together and forming clots in the arteries, which can lead to heart attacks.

457,MRK,UPDATE 2-Merck's anti-blood clot drug should be approved -U.S. FDA review,"By Toni Clarke Jan 13 (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc’s experimental blood clot-preventing drug vorapaxar should be approved, based on “robustly positive” clinical trial results, according to a preliminary review of the data by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The review, posted on the FDA’s website on Monday, comes two days ahead of a meeting of outside medical experts who are expected to recommend whether it should be approved. The FDA usually follows the advice of its advisory panels. The drug, which would be sold under the brand name Zontivity, is designed to prevent heart-related deaths, cardiac arrests and strokes in patients who have had a recent heart attack. It would not be recommended for patients who have previously had a stroke because of an increased risk of bleeding in the brain. Results from a trial known as TRA 2P “are sufficient to establish the effectiveness of vorapaxar for its proposed indication,” the review found. The main safety concern with the drug is bleeding, the review found, though it noted that the rate of fatal bleeding was low in the population for whom the drug is proposed. The FDA did not recommend that the company establish a risk management program, nor did it recommend that the company conduct additional trials following approval. Vorapaxar works by preventing blood cells, known as platelets, from clumping together and forming clots in the arteries, which can lead to heart attacks. Other anti-platelets include aspirin and Plavix, which is made by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Merck’s drug works in a different way, by inhibiting a receptor known as PAR-1.

460,MRK,"Merck needs a dose of joie de vivre, research chief says","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Merck & Co’s (MRK.N) researchers need to regain their confidence after an eight-year drought in developing important new medicines sapped employee morale, the company’s recently hired research chief told Reuters. Employees of the second-largest U.S. drugmaker have been so badly shaken by rejected or failed drugs that their gloom has further undermined its legendary research, Merck Research Laboratories President Roger Perlmutter said in an interview during the annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference late on Monday. “What’s missing may be less the absence of a specific capability than it is a loss of esprit,” said Perlmutter, who at age 60 replaced decade-long research chief Peter Kim in April. “The various unfortunate occurrences caused people to lose the sense of joie de vivre. They lost the sense they could actually make a real difference.” At the same time, Perlmutter said he was optimistic that Merck’s slump would soon end as important new products are approved. “Much of what I need to do is reinstill in the organization the sense of competence, of vigor, of thoroughness and the willingness to take real risks in order to achieve something great,” he said. Perlmutter was no stranger to Merck when he came aboard last spring at the urging of Chief Executive Kenneth Frazier. He had overseen the company’s basic research and preclinical development for four years before joining Amgen Inc (AMGN.O), the largest U.S. biotech company, in 2001 and heading its research until 2012. “When I retired from Amgen, it was not my goal to take a job like this again; I’d done that,” he said. “And when Ken came to talk to me in the bucolic setting of Santa Barbara, with sailboats bobbing in the harbor, it was not my first thought that this is what I wanted to do.” But Perlmutter said his memory of the talent at Merck, including its respected chemists, drew him back to the New Jersey drugmaker, once dubbed “The House that Research Built” because of its emphasis on breakthrough medicines over the past half-century. The company developed the first statin, the first ACE inhibitor blood-pressure drug, the first measles vaccine. The first-in-class, best-in-class mindset was largely inspired by Roy Vagelos, a physician who was Merck’s chief executive officer from 1985 to 1994. But the situation Perlmutter faced was sobering. Merck had introduced no important innovative medicines since 2006, when it won approvals for Gardasil, the first vaccine to prevent cervical cancer, and a new type of diabetes drug called Januvia. A trail of disappointments had ensued, including failed studies of cholesterol treatment Tredaptive and migraine drug telcagepant and ongoing regulatory delays for osteoporosis medicine odanacatib. “I had one of our very senior chemists express to me her concern that maybe she just isn’t any good at this,” Perlmutter said. “She got to the point where she really doubted her own ability. And that level of self-doubt has an effect on people’s performance.” Perlmutter said some promising developments with new drugs were beginning to lift morale, including a closely watched cancer treatment called MK-3475 that works by harnessing the immune system, highly potent new oral therapies for hepatitis C and an improved version of Gardasil. Shares of Merck jumped Monday after it announced it had applied for U.S. approval for MK-3475 in patients with advanced melanoma. The company is testing this PD-1 inhibitor against other cancers and is expected to combine the drug with its other experimental treatments for the disease. Merck also aims to license or buy more drugs from other companies. Perlmutter said research and development executives could now pursue deals and buy products on their own - tapping the company’s chief financial officer only as a financial adviser - to speed up the process. “It’s not an overnight thing, but people are developing a certain bounce to their step that was missing before,” Perlmutter said, “an actual sense they can achieve something.” ",1142014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-merck-perlmutter/merck-needs-a-dose-of-joie-de-vivre-research-chief-says-idUSBREA0D12C20140114
461,MRK,FDA advisory panel backs Merck's blood clot-preventing drug,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc’s experimental blood clot-preventing drug vorapaxar should be approved to reduce the risk of further heart problems in people who have suffered a recent heart attack, an advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concluded on Wednesday. The panel voted 10-1 in favor of the drug, which would, if approved, be sold under the brand name Zontivity. The FDA is not bound to follow the advice of its advisory panels but typically does so. Results from a trial known as TRA 2P were “robust,” panelists said, and justified approval for patients who had suffered a heart attack. They agreed with the company that the drug should not be used in patients with a history of stroke, since there was an increased risk of bleeding in the brain in this group of patients. “I think this drug addresses a real unmet medical need,” said Dr. Philip Sager, consulting professor of medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine. The vote followed a positive analysis by reviewers for the FDA, whose report, published on Monday, also recommended the drug be approved. Vorapaxar works by preventing blood cells, or platelets, from clumping together and forming clots in the arteries, which can lead to heart attacks. Other anti-platelets include aspirin and Plavix, which is made by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Merck’s drug works in a different way, by inhibiting a receptor known as PAR-1. The drug increased the overall risk of bleeding in clinical trials, though the risk in patients who had not had a stroke did not outweigh the drug’s benefit, panelists said. Still, Dr. Sanjay Kaul, a cardiologist and professor at UCLA School of Medicine who voted in favor of approval, urged the FDA to “do its due diligence” around the bleeding risk. Each year about 190,000 Americans have a second heart-related event, according to Merck. Standard therapy to prevent a second episode often includes treatment with aspirin and Plavix. Vorapaxar would be given in addition to standard treatment. “The results of today’s advisory committee mark an important milestone in our effort to bring vorapaxar to appropriate patients with a history of heart attack,” Dr. Daniel Bloomfield, who leads Merck’s cardiovascular research, said in a statement. “We look forward to working with the FDA as it completes its review.” Merck has proposed that the drug’s label urge caution when prescribing the drug for patients who weigh less than 60 kilograms (132 lbs) since the risk of bleeding in these patients appears to be higher than in heavier patients. Panelists could not reach a consensus recommendation on how lower-weight patients should be treated. Representatives from the FDA said they will continue to discuss the matter before making their final ruling.

465,MRK,No serious side effects with Merck allergy pill: FDA documents,"(Reuters) - No serious safety concerns were raised over Merck & Co’s experimental pill for ragweed allergies, according to FDA documents Friday, ahead of a meeting next week of outside medical experts who will discuss whether the drug merits approval. The Allergenic Products Advisory Committee will meet on Tuesday to review Ragwitek, a pill placed under the tongue that, if approved, would be an alternative to regular injections administered by doctors for ragweed pollen allergies. At the meeting, the panel will be asked to discuss whether available clinical trial data supports the safety and the efficacy of the product in persons 18 years of age and older and make recommendations to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The committee will also be asked to recommend to the agency whether any additional studies of the drug might be needed. The FDA documents appeared to favor the drug’s safety, saying “none of the adverse events categorized as serious by investigators or (Merck) are considered related to the study drug.” The document also said “there were no deaths in any of the five clinical development trials of Ragwitek.” About 30 million people in the United States suffer allergies to ragweed pollen, the FDA said. Analysts see eventual Ragwitek sales of about $300 million. However, Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said sales could reach as much as $1 billion if enough allergy sufferers prefer the pill to injections. The pill, which is comprised of extracts from short ragweed pollen, would be taken daily beginning 12 weeks prior to the start of the ragweed pollen season and throughout the season. Merck filed its application seeking U.S. approval of Ragwitek last March. The drug, and another pill for grass pollen allergies called Grastek, are being developed along with Danish Drugmaker ALK Abello.

470,MRK,Merck gets buyout interest for consumer health unit: sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) has received approaches from large consumer companies interested in buying its consumer healthcare business, best known for Coppertone sunscreen and Claritin allergy medicine, according to people familiar with the matter. Merck’s consumer healthcare business, which also includes Dr. Scholl’s foot care and other consumer products, could be worth as much as $8 billion to $10 billion in a sale, or roughly four to five times the unit’s annual revenue, some of the people said. Merck, the No. 2 U.S. drugmaker after Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), is considering alternatives for both its consumer and animal health businesses and has said it expects to complete the review in 2014. Among a range of options it has considered for the consumer unit, Merck discussed a potential asset swap with Novartis AG NOVN.VX, under which Merck would give up its consumer assets in return for the Swiss drugmaker’s animal health and other units, Reuters and others previously reported. The probability of carrying out such a deal, however, is currently seen as low due to the complexity of valuing different businesses, prompting Merck to explore an outright sale of its consumer unit as well, people familiar with the matter said. Merck has been in conversations with several interested parties and is being advised by Morgan Stanley (MS.N) on the process, the people said, asking not to be named because the conversations are private. For its much larger animal health unit, the second-largest in the industry after Zoetis Inc (ZTS.N), Merck is evaluating the potential of spinning it off as a separate publicly traded company, people familiar with the matter said. Analysts and people familiar with the industry say big consumer companies such as Reckitt Benckiser Group (RB.L) and Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) could be logical buyers for Merck’s consumer healthcare business. Reckitt already owns over-the-counter medicines including Mucinex and Nurofen and the international rights for the Scholl foot care business. Its chief executive told Reuters in a September interview that Reckitt aimed to be a major player in consumer healthcare and has the firepower to do sizeable deals. Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) also has a portfolio that includes a range of medicines and beauty products. Reckitt and P&G; declined to comment. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) is the biggest player in the $200 billion global consumer health industry, with about 4 percent of the market, followed by Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE) and GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L). Merck, however, is relatively small with around 1 percent of the market. Merck has said in the past that it views its consumer business as sub-scale. In considering options for the consumer and animal health businesses, Merck is following in the footsteps of other drugmakers such as Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), which created shareholder value by seperating non-core assets. Pfizer sold its infant-nutrition business to Nestle SA NESN.VX for $11.9 billion in 2012, and last year spun off its animal health unit as a separate publicly traded company called Zoetis. Many other drugmakers have been looking to shed businesses, prompted by pricing pressure and increasing competition that has forced a more rigorous approach to capital allocation. They have shown a new willingness to consider whether other companies may be better owners for certain assets. A Merck spokeswoman declined to comment on details of the strategic review.

472,MRK,Ablynx agrees Merck cancer deal worth up to 1.7 billion euros,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgian biotech company Ablynx has signed a deal with Merck & Co worth up to 1.7 billion euros ($2.3 billion) to develop ways of triggering the body to fight cancer by itself. The collaboration involves a new generation of drugs designed to activate the immune system. The first in the field - Bristol-Meyer Squibb’s Yervoy - is targeting melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. Rival Merck filed the first part of an application to market its own potential drug for advanced melanoma earlier this month, pushing up its share price. The firm is testing the same drug for lung and renal cancer. Ablynx, which already has a neurology partnership with the U.S. drugmaker dating back to 2012, said on Monday that it would be responsible for discovering antibody-derived proteins, known as nanobodies, to target “immune checkpoint modulators”. The modulators regulate the body’s immune response, but cancers can evade the immune system because tumor cells can be like the patient’s own and can also interfere with the immune response. Ablynx believes its nanobodies - typically a 10th the size of an antibody, and able to penetrate further and be manipulated more than an antibody - could help activate the immune system to attack cancer cells. Under the terms of the deal, Ablynx will receive a payment of 20 million euros and up to 10.7 million euros in research funding during an initial three-year research term. The firm is eligible for payments on reaching development, regulatory and commercial milestones with a potential to accrue as much as 1.7 billion euros plus royalties. “This is a very big new initiative,” Chief Executive Edwin Moses told Reuters by telephone, adding that normally products would take 10 to 15 years to get to market. “What’s a little bit different here is that because the potential of this therapeutic approach is so encouraging, you see the products beginning to get fast-track status from regulators ... you could see three, four, five years taken off that timeline, although you’ve got to wait and see.” Analysts estimate peak sales for Yervoy could be $6 billion, while the market for cancer immunotherapy could reach $35 billion a year in a decade. Ablynx shares rose as much as 6.9 percent and at 1220 GMT were up 6.2 percent at 7.69 euros, the strongest performers on a slightly weaker Euronext Brussels market. KBC Securities analyst Jan De Kerpel, with a “buy” rating on the stock, raised his price target to 13 euros from 12.5. “Altogether they get some 30 million euros. This is not just Merck trying something. That was the first deal in 2012,” he said. “The conclusion from that first project is that they are very pleased with how Ablynx works and they are now coming with a much bigger project.” Ablynx, loss-making since it listed its shares on the stock market in 2007, makes its revenues through development deals with large pharma groups such as Merck Serono, AbbVie and Boehringer Ingelheim.

474,MRK,"FTSE inches lower, pulled down by Lloyds","* FTSE 100 down 0.3 percent * Lloyds falls; delays dividend prospect after mis-selling charge * Reckitt up on talk of move for Merck unit By Tricia Wright LONDON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Britain’s top shares inched lower on Monday, extending recent hefty falls, led down by Lloyds Banking Group. Lloyds fell 2.4 percent after it said it had set aside a further 1.8 billion pounds ($2.96 billion) in the fourth quarter to compensate customers mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI), and dividend payouts were to come later than some in the market had anticipated. “Continued higher-than-expected PPI claims - now elongated to an extent than surprised me - and the resumption of dividend payments moved back later than expected has certainly taken the shine of the stock,” said Jordan Hiscott, sales trader at Gekko Global Markets. However, he said the 100-day moving average, currently at 77.8, could act as support - noting that Gekko’s client base is using Monday’s weakness in the shares, now trading at 81.3 pence, as a buying opportunity. Consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser, however, rose 1.9 percent, one of the biggest boosts to the FTSE 100, with traders citing speculation the maker of Nurofen pain relief tablets may make a move for Merck & Co’s consumer healthcare (CH) business. “We believe the acquisition of Merck’s OTC/CH assets would ... be very attractive to RB (Reckitt Benckiser),” analysts at Bernstein wrote in a note. “We estimate this would push RB up from global #9 to #3 in CH and would result in RB becoming the global leader in Cough, Cold and Allergy.” The FTSE 100 was down 21.01 points, or 0.3 percent, at 6,489.43 points by 0924 GMT, having dropped 0.4 percent on Friday. It fell 3.5 percent in January, its biggest monthly decline since last June and its worst January since 2010. After an encouraging start to the year, which saw the UK benchmark post gains in the first two weeks, equity markets took a turn for the worse as unease about slowing Chinese growth and the withdrawal of U.S. monetary stimulus spread from emerging market currencies to the world’s big stock markets. Alongside the emerging market worries, investor concern has focused on the current earnings season, and whether it will result in profits strong enough to justify lofty valuations after a bumper 2013. While Monday was quiet on the earnings front, there are plenty of releases later on in the week - from the likes of oil majors BG and BP, drugmakers AstraZeneca  and GlaxoSmithKline, and mobile phone group Vodafone . Vodafone is set to become one of the latest high profile victims of the chaos engulfing the emerging economies of Africa and Asia, readying itself for a big slide in its overseas revenues, weekend press reports said. “(Earnings have) been particularly ropey in the UK,” Peel Hunt equity strategist Ian Williams said. “I think one or two investors have realised that valuations are at the top end of that recent range and you can’t afford the number of disappointments on the trading front which we still appear to be getting,” he said. The FTSE 100 is trading on a 12-month forward price/earnings ratio of 13.3 times, against its 10-year average of 11.9 times, Thomson Reuters Datastream shows. Of the 17 percent of European companies to have reported so far, 44 percent have missed profits expectations, while 46 percent have missed expectations on revenue, Thomson Reuters Starmine data shows.

477,MRK,"Merck results flag, but cancer-drug deals lift shares","(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc’s quarterly profit and sales just missed expectations as its medicines faced competition from cheaper generics, but the company announced potentially lucrative new cancer-drug partnerships with rival U.S. drugmakers. For the full year, Merck expected to earn $3.35 to $3.53 per share, excluding special items. The average analyst estimate was $3.48 per share. “Overall, I view this guidance as ‘good enough,’ given fairly widespread Street concerns about a ‘mega-miss,’” ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said, adding that investors remain more focused on prospects for the company’s array of experimental drugs. Separately on Wednesday, Merck said it plans to test its closely followed immuno-oncology drug MK-3475, in combination with medicines being developed by Pfizer Inc, Amgen Inc and Incyte Corp. Financial terms of the deals were not disclosed. Merck shares were up 0.3 percent in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after rising as much as 3.1 percent earlier on Wednesday. Schoenebaum said investors were enthused about the planned new studies of MK-3475, a so-called PD-1 inhibitor that works by harnessing the immune system to find and destroy cancer cells. Industry analysts believe the medicine, if approved, could generate annual sales of $2 billion or more and greatly improve treatment of melanoma and potentially other cancers. They also believe such immuno-oncology drugs may have special promise if used in combination with each other. The second-biggest U.S. drugmaker said on Wednesday it earned $781 million, or 26 cents per share, in the fourth quarter. That compared with $908 million, or 30 cents per share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding special items, Merck earned 88 cents per share. The average analyst forecast was 89 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue fell 4 percent to $11.32 billion. Wall Street was expecting $11.36 billion. Merck shares rose 22 percent in 2013, underperforming a 27 percent average gain for other large U.S. and European drugmakers, amid waning sales of its Januvia diabetes medicines and uncertainty about its drug pipeline. The company is hoping that MK-3475 and other drugs will be approved and revive sales and earnings growth, following failures or setbacks over the past five years for its treatments for heart disease, osteoporosis and other diseases. Sales of Januvia, Merck’s biggest product, fell 1 percent to $1.12 billion in the fourth quarter, while sales of a related combination medicine called Janumet rose 11 percent to $503 million. Double-digit sales gains were seen for arthritis treatment Remicade and HIV treatment Isentress. But sales of asthma drug, Singulair, now facing generics, tumbled 38 percent to $298 million. Sales of the company’s animal health products, which usually prop up results, slipped 3 percent to $871 million in the quarter. They were hurt by the company’s voluntary suspension of sales earlier in the year of Zilmax, a feed supplement that some critics have alleged caused dangerous weight gains in cattle. Merck said on Wednesday it will study MK-3475 in combination with Pfizer’s approved kidney-cancer drug Inlyta, and separately test MK-3475 against various cancers in combination with a Pfizer immuno-oncology drug called PF-05082566 (PF-2566).

483,MRK,Merck to settle NuvaRing lawsuits for $100 mln -media report,"Feb 6 (Reuters) - Merck & Co has agreed to pay $100 million to settle hundreds of lawsuits accusing the U.S. drugmaker of downplaying serious health risks associated with its NuvaRing contraceptive device, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the deal. The agreement, which would settle cases in federal and state courts, will be announced on Friday and pay about $58,000 per complaint, according to the report. Merck is facing more than 1,700 lawsuits accusing it of failing to adequately warn NuvaRing users or downplaying a potential increased risk of developing dangerous blood clots known as venous thromboembolism, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Plaintiffs are seeking damages for a range of injuries allegedly caused by the birth control device, including heart attack, stroke and sudden death. A judge presiding over federal cases, which have been consolidated in Missouri federal court, has scheduled a hearing on the matter for Friday morning. NuvaRing has been available to women in the United States since 2001. It is one of several contraceptive products that have been linked to an increased risk of developing blood clots that can cause strokes and heart attacks. Should the $100 million figure prove to be accurate, Merck would pay a fraction of what at least one company has paid in similar settlements. German drugmaker Bayer AG last year said it had so far paid nearly $1.6 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits involving accusations that its Yaz and Yazmin birth control pills caused blood clots that led to strokes and heart attacks.

484,MRK,AstraZeneca takes on Merck in Alzheimer's drug race,"LONDON, Feb 6 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca is moving an experimental Alzheimer’s drug into late-stage development, taking on U.S. rival Merck & Co which announced plans to start similar final-stage research in December. Britain’s second-biggest drugmaker revealed its plan to move AZD3293 into the last phase of testing needed for registration as it announced full-year results on Thursday. Both the AstraZeneca and Merck medicines work by blocking an enzyme called beta secretase that is involved in production of beta-amyloid, a protein that creates brain plaques considered a major cause of Alzheimer’s disease. Such oral drugs are known as BACE inhibitors and are viewed as a promising new approach to fighting the memory-robbing condition. BACE inhibitor drugs have taken centre stage after an injectable class of medicines targeting beta-amyloid plaque failed or fell short in trials conducted by Pfizer and Eli Lilly. Not all experts accept that reducing beta-amyloid is the key to defeating Alzheimer’s, however, and the safety of the new BACE drugs has also been a subject of concern after Lilly pulled the plug on its product due to liver toxicity. Mene Pangalos, AstraZeneca’s head of innovative medicines and early development, told analysts there had been no signs of similar problems with his company’s product. AZD3293 also had a clean profile in terms of potential heart problems, he added. “We have a very potent molecule, not dissimilar to Merck’s molecule,” he added. AstraZeneca is integrating Phase II and Phase III trials for its drug, which Pangalos said could either lead to a second pivotal Phase III study or, if the data was strong enough, an immediate filing for regulatory approval. ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum said Merck was probably some six months ahead of AstraZeneca in the BACE race, with the first Phase III data from the U.S. company’s programme likely to emerge in around 2017. Dementia - of which Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form - already affects 44 million people worldwide and this is set to reach 135 million by 2050, according to Alzheimer’s Disease International, a non-profit campaign group. Unlike heart disease and cancer, no major advancements have been seen in Alzheimer’s drug research since the first treatment was approved in 1993 by U.S. regulators. Current Alzheimer’s drugs, including generic forms of Pfizer’s Aricept (donepezil), can minimally and briefly help memory and ability to perform daily functions, but do not slow the disease.",2062014,http://www.reuters.com/article/astrazeneca-earnings-alzheimers/astrazeneca-takes-on-merck-in-alzheimers-drug-race-idUSL5N0LB31520140206

487,MRK,"Merck, Utrecht University to research pig virus vaccine","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Merck Animal Health, a division of Merck & Co., entered into a 12-month research agreement with Utrecht University to develop a vaccine for Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus (PEDv), a deadly pig virus spreading across the U.S. farm belt, the company said. The highly contagious pig virus, which does not affect humans, has been seen in Europe and Asia, but was first discovered in the United States in April 2013 and has spread to 23 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. “Vaccine development on PEDv has been hampered by the difficulty of growing the virus in cell culture and, until very recently, by the lack of tools for its genetic manipulation,” Peter Rottier, a scientist at the Netherlands’ Utrecht University said in a statement. PEDv, which causes diarrhea, vomiting and severe dehydration in hogs, is transmitted orally and through pig faeces. Strict biosecurity measures have been hog producers’ first line of defense against the virus. Harrisvaccines, an Ames, Iowa based animal pharmaceutical company was one of the first U.S. companies to develop a vaccine to fight PEDv. While older pigs have a chance of survival, the virus kills 80 to 100 percent of piglets that contract it. There are no official figures on the number of U.S. pigs killed by the virus but industry analysts estimate millions of hogs have died and the virus could reduce the U.S. hog supplies by 2 to 4 percent. Vaccines have been used to fight PEDv in Asia and Europe but those vaccines are not approved for use in the United States due to concerns over their effectiveness, animal health officials said.

489,MRK,Merck to pay $100 million in NuvaRing contraceptive settlement,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co said on Friday it will pay $100 million to resolve all U.S. product liability lawsuits alleging it downplayed serious health risks involving its NuvaRing intrauterine contraceptive device. The product, which contains the hormones estrogen and progestin commonly found in birth control bills, is associated with an increased risk of developing blood clots that can cause heart attacks, strokes or sudden deaths. Available to women in the United States since 2001, NuvaRing is one of several contraceptive products linked to this higher risk. Merck, the second-biggest U.S. drugmaker, denied any fault under the agreement, which must be accepted by 95 percent of about 3,800 eligible patients involved in lawsuits pending in federal and state courts. A lawyer for the plaintiffs, Roger Denton of Schlichter, Bogard and Denton, said the settlement, reached after nearly a year of negotiations, is “an outstanding result and in the best interests of all the women who have suffered an injury associated with the use of Nuvaring.” Under the settlement, Merck would pay a fraction of what at least one company has paid in a similar settlement. German drugmaker Bayer AG said last year it had paid nearly $1.6 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits involving accusations that its Yaz and Yazmin birth control pills caused blood clots that led to strokes and heart attacks.

494,MRK,"Exclusive: Bayer, Novartis, others eye Merck's consumer health unit - sources","NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - A handful of consumer and healthcare companies including Bayer AG and Novartis are exploring a deal for Merck & Co Inc’s consumer healthcare business, as they seek to gain scale in a fragmented industry, according to several people familiar with the matter. Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC and Procter & Gamble Co are also among the parties that have held discussions with Merck about buying the unit, best known for Coppertone sunscreen and Claritin allergy medicine, the sources said this week. The Merck business, which also includes Dr. Scholl’s foot care and other consumer products, could be worth $10 billion to $12 billion in a potential sale, the people said, asking not to be identified because the process is private. Despite the large size of a potential deal and the unit’s various product lines, Merck is focused on selling the consumer health business in its entirety, not in parts, the people said. Merck, Bayer, Novartis, Reckitt and P&G; all declined to comment. Merck is meeting with potential buyers after receiving preliminary offers a few weeks ago, and is expected to seek second-round offers in late March, the people said. Germany’s Bayer already has a strong portfolio of consumer products including pain medication Aleve and antacid Alka-Seltzer, but is looking at deals to expand the business further. In 2012, Bayer lost a bidding war with Reckitt for Schiff Nutrition International Inc, which agreed to sell to the British consumer products group for $1.3 billion. Reckitt owns over-the-counter medicines including Mucinex and Nurofen and the international rights for the Scholl foot care business. Its chief executive told Reuters in September that Reckitt aimed to be a major player in consumer healthcare and has the firepower to do sizeable deals. Procter & Gamble also has a portfolio that includes a range of health products, including Vicks cold and flu treatment and Prilosec heartburn medication. Among a range of options it has considered for the consumer unit, Merck discussed a potential asset swap with Novartis AG under which Merck would give up its consumer assets in return for the Swiss drugmaker’s animal health and other units, Reuters and others previously reported. The probability of carrying out such a deal, however, was seen as low due to the complexity of valuing different businesses, prompting Merck to explore an outright sale of its consumer unit as well, Reuters reported in January. Novartis remains interested, and could offer cash instead if an asset swap does not pan out, the people familiar with the matter said. Merck, the second-largest U.S. drugmaker after Pfizer Inc, is being advised by Morgan Stanley on the process, Reuters reported last month. Johnson & Johnson is the biggest player in the $200 billion global consumer health industry, with about 4 percent of the market. Bayer, GlaxoSmithKline PLC, Novartis, Pfizer and Sanofi SA are the other major players, each with a market share of more than 2 percent. Merck, however, is relatively small with around 1 percent of the market, and has said in the past that it views its consumer business as sub-scale. Other large companies with consumer healthcare divisions, such as Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi, have competing products to Merck and are seen as unlikely buyers. Sanofi’s Allegra allergy medication and Johnson and Johnson’s Zyrtec may overlap with Merck’s Claritin brand. GSK is not pursuing the Merck business either, given its current low appetite for deals and the poor fit between the firms’ consumer health portfolios, according to one person familiar with the matter. Merck’s Claritin allergy franchise would also overlap with GSK’s Flonase nasal spray, the person added. A GSK spokesman declined to comment. In exploring alternatives for the consumer business, Merck is following in the footsteps of other drugmakers such as Pfizer, which created shareholder value by separating non-core assets. Pfizer sold its infant-nutrition business to Nestle SA for $11.9 billion in 2012, and last year spun off its animal health unit as a separate publicly traded company called Zoetis Inc. Many other drugmakers have been looking to shed businesses, prompted by pricing pressure and increasing competition that has forced a more rigorous approach to capital allocation. They have shown a new willingness to consider whether other companies may be better owners for certain assets.

497,MRK,Merck says dust mite allergy drug reduces symptoms in midstage study,"March 4 (Reuters) - An immunotherapy pill to treat an allergy to house dust mites being tested by Merck & Co  significantly reduced common nasal symptoms, such as sneezing and stuffy nose, according to data from a midstage clinical trial, the company said on Tuesday. The drug, MK-8237, reduced nasal symptoms by 49 percent at the higher tested dose and 27 percent at the lower dose compared with a placebo after 24 weeks of treatment. The results, which were deemed to be statistically significant, were presented on Tuesday at the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) meeting in San Diego. MK-8237, a once-a-day tablet designed to dissolve under the tongue, is the third oral allergy immunotherapy treatment being developed by Merck. The U.S. drugmaker and its Danish allergy development partner ALK Abello are awaiting U.S. approval decisions likely this year for sublingual tablets that treat grass and ragweed allergies that would be alternatives to regular allergy shots at a doctor’s office. Over time, the drugs train the immune system to stop reacting abnormally to exposure to allergens. The primary goal of the 124-patient study was a significant reduction at week 24 in average total nasal symptom score (TNSS) reported over the last four hours of a six-hour session in a special room where they were exposed to enough dust mites to set off allergic reactions. TNSS was comprised of itchy nose, blocked nose, runny nose and sneezing. A secondary goal combined TNSS results at 24 weeks with a measure of ocular symptoms, such as red, itchy or watery eyes. By that measure, the higher dose of the Merck drug reduced symptoms by 52 percent compared with placebo and by 29 percent for the lower dose. The reduction in eye symptoms alone was as high as 68 percent, Merck said. “We had not expected to see such pronounced effects on both nasal and ocular symptoms with this product, so we are very encouraged by this data,” Dr. Hendrik Nolte, clinical leader of Merck’s allergy immunotherapy program who presented the data at the meeting, said in a telephone interview. No serious adverse side effects were reported by patients in the study. The most common side effects, deemed to be mild to moderate, included throat irritation, mouth edema and lip swelling. Merck said it is recruiting patients for a large, pivotal Phase III trial of the dust mite allergy treatment that it hopes to complete next year.",3042014,http://www.reuters.com/article/merck-allergy/merck-says-dust-mite-allergy-drug-reduces-symptoms-in-midstage-study-idUSL1N0M11X520140304
498,MRK,Merck hepatitis C drugs work in HIV co-infected patients -study,"March 5 (Reuters) - A combination of oral drugs for hepatitis C developed by Merck & Co appeared to be well tolerated and highly effective in treating the liver disease in patients also infected with HIV, according to data from a midstage clinical trial presented on Wednesday. The Merck drugs, MK-5172 and MK-8742, which belong to promising new classes of anti-viral medicines, were tested over a 12-week course of treatment both with and without the older hepatitis C drug ribavirin in co-infected patients. After 12 weeks of treatment, all 29 patients who received the two Merck drugs and ribavirin had undetectable levels of the hepatitis C virus. Among those who got just the experimental Merck drugs, 26 of 29, or 90 percent, appeared to have the hepatitis C virus eliminated from their blood. If the virus remains undetectable 12 weeks after completion of treatment, those patients are considered cured. The available data from the ongoing study was presented at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) in Boston. More detailed results of the study dubbed C-Worthy are expected to be presented at a European medical meeting in April, Merck said. No co-infected patients discontinued treatment due to either an adverse side effect or study medication intolerance, Merck said. The most common side effects of fatigue and headache were no more prevalent in patients with hepatitis C and HIV infection than what had been observed in patients with hepatitis C alone. A new era in treatment for the serious liver disease has begun with several companies, including Gilead Sciences Inc , AbbVie and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, developing all oral treatment regimens that have demonstrated cure rates well in excess of 90 percent with treatment durations of just 12 weeks or shorter. Current standard treatments take 24 to 48 weeks and include the injected drug interferon that causes miserable flu-like symptoms and cure about 75 percent of patients. Those also living with the virus that causes AIDS are an important patient population. About seven million people worldwide are co-infected with HIV and hepatitis C (HCV). Co-infected patients have a three times higher rate of progression to cirrhosis and a six times higher risk of liver decompression than those with HCV alone.",3052014,http://www.reuters.com/article/merck-hepatitis/merck-hepatitis-c-drugs-work-in-hiv-co-infected-patients-study-idUSL1N0M22FO20140305
499,MRK,CORRECTED-Amgen vaccine triggers immune response in advanced melanoma -study,"(In 2nd paragraph adds dropped word “not” to show that vaccine also shrank tumors not injected with the drug.) By Bill Berkrot March 14 (Reuters) - An experimental Amgen Inc  cancer vaccine used to treat advanced melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, proved effective in a late-stage study in shrinking tumors in a way that suggests the drug triggered the intended systemic immune response, according to data presented on Friday. The vaccine shrank tumors that were directly injected with the drug and tumors around the body that were not injected, according to the data. The drug, talimogene laherparepvec, also known as T-vec, is an engineered virus designed to replicate inside the injected tumor, killing cancer cells there, as well as prime the immune system to attack other cancer cells around body. Dr. Robert Andtbacka, one of the study’s lead investigators, in a telephone interview, called the results “very encouraging.” Amgen last year released initial data from the 295-patient Phase III study showing that T-vec succeeded in demonstrating a significant tumor response that lasted at least six months. The latest data analyzed 4,000 tumor lesions to study the response to the drug in injected versus non-injected tumors. Of the directly injected tumors, 64 percent shrank by at least half, and 47 percent of those had a complete response, meaning the lesion had disappeared, researchers said. Of the uninjected lesions in the skin or lymph nodes, known as non-visceral tumor lesions, 34 percent shrank by at least half with a complete response seen in 21 percent of those. “We also want to see responses in distant lesions that are not injected such as in the liver, in the lung and other places,” Andtbacka explained. Of those so-called visceral tumors on solid organs, 15 percent shrank by at least 50 percent, said Andtbacka, who presented the data at the Society of Surgical Oncology Cancer Symposium in Phoenix. “This indicates to us that we have activation of the immune system to fight these tumors at a distant site,” Andtbacka said. “This is a new generation of oncolytic immunotherapy where you’re seeing very robust responses in injected lesions but  also robust responses in non-injected lesions. This bodes well for the future for this product,” added Andtbacka, an associate professor in the division of surgical oncology at the University of Utah School of Medicine. Amgen said it expects to have further data in the first half of this year showing whether T-vec ultimately helped patients in the study to live longer. The company has not yet said when it will apply for approval of the medicine. Andtbacka said he expects the future of the drug will involve its use in combination with other types of cancer immunotherapies, especially in treating patients with non injectable visceral tumors. Amgen is already testing T-vec in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s melanoma drug Yervoy and has agreed to study T-vec in combination with Merck & Co’s  experimental immunotherapy from a highly promising class called PD-1 inhibitors. Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer. About 132,000 melanoma cases occur globally each year, according to World Health Organization. “We are extremely excited about the data and the potential for combinations with other treatments,” said David Chang, Amgen’s head of global oncology development.

501,MRK,"Merck, Glaxo end co-pay assistance for Obamacare plans","March 26 (Reuters) - Merck and Co Inc and GlaxoSmithKline Plc are not reimbursing drug co-payments for patients who purchase their health insurance through state and federal exchanges set up under the Obamacare program. The two drugmakers said their decision, first reported by Bloomberg News, is based on uncertainty about whether insurance programs offered under the Affordable Care Act are governed by federal laws that ban kickbacks to businesses. To cap rising healthcare costs and give consumers more incentive to reduce spending, insurers in recent years have increased the out-of-pocket costs patients are expected to pay for medications. At the same time, most drugmakers offer patient assistance programs, or coupons, to people who might otherwise not be able to afford medications that have been prescribed by doctors. Merck, which makes drugs such as Januvia for diabetes, said it plans to revisit its decision once more information is available about implementation of the law governing the federal health program. Glaxo, maker of asthma medication Advair, said it is “committed to helping patients access our medications.” Amgen Inc, which makes biotech drugs including arthritis medication Enbrel, said it continues to offer cost-sharing assistance to eligible patients. “Under the new health insurance exchanges, it is not uncommon for patients to face coinsurance of 40 percent or more for their prescriptions,” Amgen said in an emailed statement.

503,MRK,Merck names Baxter exec as CFO,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc appointed Baxter International Inc executive Robert Davis as chief financial officer, as it looks to cut costs and focus on drugs that are more likely to be approved by regulators. Merck - struggling with slowing sales, delays in new drug approvals and failures of experimental drugs - said in October it would cut 8,500 jobs and chop annual operating costs by $2.5 billion. “The main thing for Davis to focus on is trying to make Merck’s structure more flexible so that it can move more quickly to areas that have good returns,” Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said. He said a key decision Davis would have to help make related to the company’s plans for its animal healthcare and consumer business. Reuters reported in February that Merck was in discussions to sell its consumer healthcare business, as part a plan to narrow its focus to its pharmaceutical products with the best chance of winning regulatory approval. Davis, 47, was the CFO of Baxter for four years until May 2010. Since then, he has been running Baxter’s medical products business and oversaw the integration of the medication delivery and renal businesses, along with manufacturing and research and development. “(Davis) will be an asset to us in implementing a significantly streamlined, more flexible cost structure and operating model, while enabling us to focus on our highest-potential growth opportunities,” Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier said in a statement on Thursday. Faced with patent expiries and competition from generics, Merck and its peers, including Pfizer Inc, AstraZeneca Plc and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, have aimed to bolter growth by slashing jobs and costs. Merck is facing slowing sales growth for its biggest franchise, the diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet which have combined annual sales of $6 billion. Sales of its asthma drug, Singulair, have plunged since its went off patent in 2012. A year back, Merck brought back one of its veterans to head research and development after setbacks to some of its most important experimental drugs. “We will be closely listening to any comments around further restructuring and divestitures with a new CFO coming in,” JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott wrote in a note. Davis will take on his new role in Merck on April 23, replacing Peter Kellogg, the company’s CFO since 2007. Kellogg, who was previously CFO at Biogen Idec Inc, will leave the company on May 16. “I don’t think there was any negative sentiment towards the outgoing CFO,” Morningstar’s Conover told Reuters. “He’d really done a good job with integrating Schering-Plough and a lot of the cost cutting plans initially.” Davis joined Baxter in 2004 after more than 14 years at Eli Lilly and Co. The news of his appointment comes on the same day that Baxter said it would spin off its biotechnology operations and focus on its core medical technology business. Merck’s shares were down slightly at about $55.85 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

The move come as Merck is struggling with slowing sales of its flagship drugs and failures or delays in new drug approvals, while Baxter is planning to split into two companies. Sales of Merck’s diabetes drug, Januvia, have been slowing and sales of its asthma drug, Singulair, fell by a more than a third last quarter due to generic competition. The company cut 8,500 jobs in October and said it would cut annual operating costs by $2.5 billion.

507,MRK,S.Korea to allow sales of Merck's Zilmax from June,"SEOUL, April 1 (Reuters) - South Korea will allow certain levels of animal feed additive zilpaterol in beef from June, a government official said on Tuesday, opening the door to imports of some meat containing the growth enhancer and its domestic sale. Seoul had said in October that restrictions would be eased sometime in 2014, ending a zero tolerance policy on zilpaterol-based drugs such as Merck & Co’s Zilmax. The feed additive has been under global scrutiny since a video emerged in the United States in August showing animals struggling to walk and with other signs of distress after taking a growth drug. South Korea suspended some U.S. beef imports for more than two months last year after traces of zilpaterol were found in two shipments. Son Seong-wan, a director in South Korea’s food ministry, told Reuters that from June the government would allow 1 part per billion (ppb) of zilpaterol in beef muscle and 5 ppb in beef liver. He said that compared with levels of 2 ppb in beef muscle permitted in Canada and 12 ppb in beef liver in the United States. He added that 60 days of public hearings on the move had begun in February. Many Asian and European countries ban the import of zilpaterol-fed beef due to concerns about the side effects of additives.

508,MRK,UPDATE 1-Stallergenes wins U.S. go-ahead for Oralair allergy pill,"* Drug is first such immunotherapy pill licensed in U.S. * Merck and partner ALK Abello expected to launch rival drug this year * Shares in Stallergenes rise 6 percent   (Adds detail, share price, analyst comment) CHICAGO/PARIS, April 2, (Reuters) - France’s Stallergenes  has received U.S. regulatory approval to sell the first immunotherapy pill against grass allergies in the world’s biggest pharmaceutical market, sending its shares up 6 percent on Wednesday. Stallergenes has said it sees a potential U.S. market of nearly 3 million patients that will eventually be worth $1 billion in annual sales for these types of drugs. “That’s very positive news as the group is considerably expanding its market,” Gilbert Dupont analysts wrote in a note. Oralair is a fast-dissolving tablet to be placed under the tongue that contains extracts from five types of grass pollen: sweet vernal, orchard, perennial rye, timothy and Kentucky bluegrass. It harnesses the immune system to alleviate allergies and is an alternative to current treatments that need to be injected. Merck and Danish partner ALK Abello are also expected to launch their rival therapy Grastek in the United States this year. In December, both drugs received strong recommendations from outside advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Oralair was approved in the European Union in 2008 and is also sold in Canada, Australia and Russia for the treatment of grass pollen allergy. It generated revenue of 22.2 million euros ($30.5 million) in 2013, up 37 percent from 2012. Greer Laboratories, Stallergenes’ U.S. partner, aims to begin selling Oralair within weeks of the FDA’s go-ahead. But the peak season for Oralair prescriptions is between December and June, so U.S. revenue from the drug this year should be limited, Stallergenes’ former chief executive said last month. The approval of Oralair triggers a first milestone payment of $10 million from Greer to Stallergenes. Overall, Stallergenes is due to receive milestone payments totaling up to $120 million, plus royalties and an undisclosed transfer price. Shares in Stallergenes were 6 percent higher at 61.49 euros at 0840 GMT, trading at more than twice their average daily volume and giving the company a market capitalisation of 843 million euros.

509,MRK,"Exclusive: Merck wants to test Zilmax on 240,000 cattle but beef industry resists","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc wants to feed its controversial feed additive Zilmax to 240,000 U.S. cattle to prove it is safe. But there is a problem: giant meat processors like Cargill Inc don’t want to touch animals fed with the drug. Merck plans to conduct the biggest ever test of its kind in an effort to reintroduce the weight-adding drug into the United States and Canada after suspending sales last August. A test herd of this size is currently worth up to $500 million. Feedlot owners, however, are reluctant to participate in the study until they get a guarantee that slaughterhouses will be willing to buy the Zilmax-fed animals. Snags with the study, whose size was confirmed to Reuters by Merck, have not been previously reported. “I’d be happy to sign up, just as soon as Merck tells me who is going to pay me after they’re done,” said a feedlot owner in Texas. “It’s been a horrible time, with the drought. I can’t afford to give away a steer, let alone hundreds.” Cargill Inc and Tyson Foods Inc, two of the world’s largest beef processors, told Reuters their stance on Zilmax had not changed since last autumn, when they stopped accepting cattle fed the drug following reports it may cause lameness. Together the two companies control 37 percent of the daily U.S. beef processing capacity. Reuters reported in December that Tyson stopped taking Zilmax-fed livestock after more than two dozen animals that had been fed the drug arrived at one of its slaughterhouses with missing hooves. The beef processors said their ban would remain until Merck had scientifically proven that Zilmax was safe for animals. They also want certainty that key export markets in Asia and elsewhere will accept such beef products. Merck has said it is confident in the “safety and performance” of Zilmax. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has deemed the drug safe for both animals and humans. A source with National Beef Packing Company said the company was not accepting Zilmax-fed cattle. JBS USA Holdings Inc, another major beef processor, did not return calls and emails for comment. Merck in December said the evaluations would start in the first quarter. But company spokeswoman Pamela Eisele declined to say this week where the 240,000 cattle would come from in the United States, whether the tests had started, or whether Merck had signed up any packing plants, ranchers or feedlots - which house and fatten up the cattle before they are slaughtered. Eisele said the company’s current plan was to sign up at least 50 U.S. feedlots, out of more than 73,000 nationwide, to participate in field tests over several months. Merck hopes to enroll five to 15 feedlots for each slaughterhouse that agrees to process the cattle, she added. Anne Burkholder, who runs a 3,000-head feed yard in Cozad, Nebraska, is eager to hear results. “We need to have a large study, where we can really look at mobility and well-being issues we’re seeing in the present,” said Burkholder, who switched to another feed additive after Merck suspended Zilmax sales. She said she never had any problems with Zilmax. The attempt to launch a large-scale study underscores Merck’s determination to put zilpaterol-based Zilmax, once the largest-selling growth drug for cattle, back on the lucrative agriculture drug market. The scale is unprecedented for a randomized, controlled study of cattle, and the logistics involved with tracking so many cattle “boggle the mind,” said Morgan Scott, an epidemiology professor at Kansas State University. Merck said it believed the field evaluations will “support the results of previous studies and the safety of the product.” A principal investigator hired by Merck, who is an epidemiologist and veterinarian, will oversee the study and analyze data, Eisele said. Merck has declined to name the investigator, or any of the scientists or other academic experts involved in the study, but said it would release the results once the study was completed. Some livestock researchers have questioned why Merck has declined to say who is leading the research effort. Others have criticized the company for promoting the study’s outcome before data are collected or analyzed. “It would suggest that they’ve already decided the results,” Scott said. Christopher Reinhardt, a feedlot extension specialist at Kansas State University, said meat packers and feedlots will make certain results are objectively reported. Merck has “a vested interest in the outcome but their partners don’t, so there is sort of a check and balance in place,” he said. Animal science experts said large-scale field studies - if done well - can offer valuable insight into drug interactions and impacts in the real world after the initial laboratory vetting required for federal regulatory approval. With Zilmax off the market since last August, rival pharmaceutical firms have grabbed market share. Many U.S. feedlots have switched to ractopamine-based Optaflexx, made by Merck rival Eli Lily & Co.’s Elanco Animal Health unit.

510,MRK,Untaxed U.S. corporate profits held overseas top $2.1 trln -study,"* Senate Finance Committee Chairman Wyden calls for reform * Total of profits stashed abroad up 93 percent 2008-2013 * GE tops list, followed by Microsoft, Pfizer, Merck, Apple By Kevin Drawbaugh and Patrick Temple-West WASHINGTON, April 8 (Reuters) - Foreign profits held overseas by U.S. corporations to avoid taxes at home nearly doubled from 2008 to 2013 to top $2.1 trillion, said a private research firm’s report, prompting a call for reform by the Senate’s top tax law writer. “The new numbers ... certainly highlight what is one of the key challenges for tax reform. I do think there need to be some reforms in this area,” Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden told reporters on Tuesday on Capitol Hill. Under U.S. law, corporations do not have to pay income tax on most of their overseas profits until they are brought into the United States. These earnings can be held offshore for years if they are classified as indefinitely invested abroad. Research firm Audit Analytics said in a report issued last week that the total of such earnings was up 93 percent from 2008 to 2013, citing federal financial filings for companies listed in the Russell 1000 index of U.S. corporations. Conglomerate General Electric Co had the biggest pile of earnings stored abroad, at $110 billion, the firm said. Next were software maker Microsoft Corp, with $76.4 billion; drugmakers Pfizer Inc, with $69 billion, and Merck & Co Inc, with $57.1 billion; and high-tech group Apple Inc, with $54.4 billion, it said. In response, GE said in a statement: “GE operates in more than 170 countries, and most of these overseas earnings have been reinvested in active business operations like manufacturing facilities and loans to non-U.S. customers.” Microsoft, Merck and Pfizer were not immediately available for comment. Apple did not respond to requests for comment. Congress has quarreled for years over the law that lets multinationals stash profits abroad tax-free. Some favor killing the law - known as offshore corporate income tax deferral - and some back a one-time tax holiday that would let companies bring foreign profits home, or “repatriate” them, at a low tax rate. Debate over offshore deferral flared again in November when Wyden’s predecessor as finance committee chairman, former Democratic Senator Max Baucus, proposed doing both. Baucus resigned weeks later to become U.S. ambassador to China. Wyden in the past has called for repeal of offshore deferral, along with a repatriation holiday, among other changes to the tax code, which he last month called “a rotten carcass that the special interests feast on.” No decisive action is likely for now, however, with Congress deadlocked over fiscal issues at least until after the November mid-term congressional elections, according to policy analysts. Next year lawmakers are likely to mount another push to overhaul the tax code, a politically difficult feat that has not been pulled off since 1986, when Republican President Ronald Reagan and a divided Congress managed to get it done. The top U.S. corporate income tax rate is 35 percent, though few multinationals pay anywhere near that thanks to tax-reducing loopholes written into the code in the past 28 years, including some that have enabled wider use of offshore deferral.

511,MRK,Merck hepatitis C drugs shine in easier to treat patients: study,"(Reuters) - A two-drug combination being tested by Merck & Co to treat hepatitis C cured 98 percent of previously untreated patients without cirrhosis in a midstage clinical trial, providing the latest evidence that the U.S. drugmaker will be highly competitive in the fast evolving field. Results of the study called C-Worthy were presented on Thursday at the annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) in London. Researchers are due on Friday to present results of how the Merck pills fared in more difficult to treat patients, such as those who failed to be helped by prior treatments and those with more advanced liver disease. In the arm of the Phase II study presented on Thursday, 43 of 44 patients treated with 100 milligrams of MK-5172 and 50 mg of MK-8742 once a day for 12 weeks achieved sustained virologic response (SVR), which is considered cured. One patient relapsed, researchers said. Those who have no detectable levels of the hepatitis C virus in their blood 12 weeks after completing the 12 weeks of treatment are deemed to have achieved SVR. Current standard treatments take 24 or 48 weeks, cure about 75 percent of patients and involve miserable side effects that have led thousands of patients to put off treatment and wait for highly touted new drugs to become available. The study also included results of patients treated with the two Merck drugs plus the older drug ribavirin for both 12 weeks and eight weeks. But all eyes will be on the ribavirin-free results as several companies race to produce all-oral treatment regimens that include neither ribavirin nor interferon, which are both used in current treatments and cause flu-like symptoms, anemia and other side effects. Gilead Sciences Inc, AbbVie and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co are also developing a new generation of all-oral hepatitis C treatments that in previous trials have demonstrated cure rates in excess of 90 percent, while cutting treatment duration to 12 weeks with few side effects. Gilead, which later this year could have a one pill, once a day two-drug regimen approved in the United States, is widely perceived by Wall Street to be the best of the bunch with some analysts forecasting annual sales of $9 billion or more. Merck is a bit behind the other three companies in its development timeline, but could prove to be the one that gives Gilead a run for its money as it aims to also produce a one pill, once a day regimen. The AbbVie and Bristol-Myers programs involve more pills and more drugs, but equally impressive cure rates so far in clinical testing. “Merck has begun a Phase III trial in (previously untreated patients) using one pill, once per day. This should increase everyone’s confidence that Merck really has a regimen competitive with Gilead’s,” ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said in a research note. The Merck anti-viral medicines, which hamper the virus’ ability to replicate in different ways, were tested in patients who had the genotype 1 form of the virus - the most prevalent and considered the most difficult to treat. The most common side effects seen with the Merck drugs were fatigue, headache and nausea. An estimated 170 million people are believed to be infected with hepatitis C worldwide. If left untreated, the progressive disease can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer or the need for a liver transplant.

519,MRK,Exclusive: Merck in final talks to sell consumer unit for near $14 billion - sources,"LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc is in the final stages of selling its consumer healthcare unit for close to $14 billion, with Bayer AG and Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc among final contenders to clinch a deal as soon as next week, people familiar with the matter said. Germany’s Bayer and British consumer products giant Reckitt have emerged as frontrunners to win the auction after each offering roughly $13.5 billion for the Merck consumer unit, best known for Coppertone sunscreen and Claritin allergy medicine, the sources said. Both bidders are very keen to buy the asset and the price tag could go higher in the final days, one person added. All the people asked not to be named because the matter is not public. Representatives for U.S. drugmaker Merck, as well as Bayer and Reckitt, declined to comment. The sale would be the latest in a wave of healthcare deals in recent days, including Zimmer Holdings Inc’s $13.35 billion acquisition of orthopaedics rival Biomet Inc and the agreement between Novartis AG and GlaxoSmithKline Plc to trade more than $20 billion worth of assets, with Eli Lilly and Co buying Novartis’ animal health business for $5.4 billion. At the same time, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc and Bill Ackman are locked in a $47 billion battle for Allergan Inc; Mylan Inc is seeking to buy Sweden’s Meda AB for around $9 billion including debt; and there is talk of a $100 billion bid for AstraZeneca Plc from Pfizer Inc. The deal surge has driven healthcare M&A; volumes to $153.3 billion so far this year, the highest year-to-date level since Thomson Reuters has started tracking data. Pharmaceutical deals have accounted for 71 percent of overall healthcare deals. The Merck auction also drew interest from several other healthcare and consumer giants including Procter & Gamble Co, Boehringer Ingelheim, Novartis and Sanofi SA, people familiar with the matter have said. The impending sale underscores drugmakers’ efforts to bolster their best businesses and exit weaker ones as the drug industry contends with healthcare spending cuts and generic competition. Reckitt owns over-the-counter medicines including Mucinex and Nurofen and the international rights for the Scholl foot care business. Its chief executive told Reuters in September that Reckitt aimed to be a major player in consumer healthcare and had the firepower to do sizeable deals. Germany’s Bayer already has a strong portfolio of consumer products including pain medication Aleve and antacid Alka-Seltzer, but is looking at deals to expand the business further. In 2012, Bayer lost a bidding war with Reckitt for Schiff Nutrition International Inc, which agreed to sell to the British consumer products group for $1.3 billion. Over-the-counter health products are attractive to companies like Reckitt and Bayer because they tap into consumer and demographic trends such as aging populations, ballooning healthcare costs and more interest in wellness. They also enjoy brand loyalty, fat margins and strong growth - and because of that they don’t come cheap. Merck is looking to sell its consumer unit as it is not a leader in the space and holds only around 1 percent of the market. In exploring alternatives for the consumer business, Merck is following in the footsteps of other drugmakers such as Pfizer, which has created shareholder value by separating non-core business units. Pfizer sold its infant-nutrition business to Nestle SA for $11.9 billion in 2012 and last year spun off its animal health unit as a separate publicly traded company called Zoetis Inc.

As part of its bid, Bayer has offered to pay the remainder of the acquisition price in cash, these people said, who asked not to be named because the matter is not public. Bayer and Britain’s Reckitt Benckiser Group (RB.L) are among the final contenders for the Merck unit, best known for Coppertone sunscreen and Claritin allergy medicine, Reuters reported last weekend. Bayer’s animal health business had net sales of 1.3 billion euros ($1.8 billion) in 2013, according to the company’s website. Representatives for Bayer declined to comment and Merck did not respond to requests for comment. Bayer’s asset swap offer is yet another evidence of drugmakers’ efforts to exit weaker businesses and focus resources on areas of strength. Last week, Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GLAX.NS) agreed to trade more than $20 billion worth of assets, with Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) buying Novartis’ animal health business for $5.4 billion. However, asset swaps are often complicated and hard to value and there is no guarantee Bayer’s offer will prevail over cash offers from rival suitors, people familiar with the matter said.

Merck & Co ‘s shares jumped 2.9 percent to $58.35, giving the S&P; 500 its biggest lift, after it reported stronger-than-expected results. Also, Britain’s Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc confirmed talks to buy Merck’s consumer health business, the latest asset up for grabs in a wave of recent pharmaceutical deals. “We’ve gone through a fair chunk of earnings and market participants kind of get the story at this juncture. On balance, with expectations having been lowered, earnings beats are coming in around 70 percent and most of the forward-looking statements have generally been pretty decent,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, which manages about $63 billion in assets.

534,MRK,Exclusive: Merck explores $15 billion-plus drug portfolio sale,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) is considering selling a big portfolio of mature drugs that could fetch more than $15 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, as the U.S. drugmaker continues to streamline businesses to focus on high-growth areas. Merck, which is also in the process of selling its $14 billion consumer healthcare unit, is working with an investment bank on the potential sale of the off-patent drugs, which could draw interest from generic drugmakers, the people said. Merck’s off-patent drugs are called “diversified brands” and many are sold in emerging markets. The sale processes underscore efforts by large drugmakers to shed smaller divisions they view as non-core so they can better focus on their mainstay products. They have shown new willingness to consider large asset swaps with rivals to exit weaker businesses and bolster core areas where they are already top players. Sanofi SA (SASY.PA), being advised by Evercore Partners Inc (EVR.N), is also in the market with its aging drug portfolio, which could fetch between $7 billion and $8 billion, Reuters reported on Tuesday. Representatives for Merck declined to comment. The sources asked not to be named because the matter is not public. Both Merck and Sanofi have an extensive line-up of older products that could be carved out, following similar moves now under way at Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L) to place older products in separate divisions. Pfizer announced last year it planned to separate its business into three units - innovative pharmaceuticals; vaccines, oncology and consumer health; and established products. The U.S. group has not ruled out a full breakup. GSK is starting down a similar path, and CEO Andrew Witty said on Wednesday that he would consider single products or broader divestiture of its established drugs.

544,MRK,"Endocyte's ovarian cancer drug fails trial, shares sink","(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc and Endocyte Inc said they had stopped a late-stage trial of their experimental ovarian cancer drug as it failed to improve survival rates without the cancer worsening, sending Endocyte’s shares tumbling as much as 63 percent. Vintafolide, Endocyte’s lead drug, was recommended for conditional approval in Europe in March but Friday’s trial failure could cast a shadow on the approval. “Now, with this development, we think the chances of formal approval are slim to none,” Christopher Raymond, analyst at Robert W. Baird, wrote in a note. The drug is the only ovarian cancer treatment in advanced trials for Merck, which is considered one of the forerunners in cancer drug research along with Roche. The European conditional approval, based on initial data, is given to drugs when they treat serious conditions with no other treatment options. The approval recommendation on March 21 had nearly doubled Endocyte’s share price. The halted trial was testing vintafolide in ovarian cancer patients who had received prior treatment. The drug failed to improve progression-free survival rates, and an independent safety committee reviewing the trial recommended that it be halted. However, the committee did not identify any safety concerns for patients enrolled in the trial, the companies said in separate statements on Friday. The companies said they had notified study investigators to suspend screening and dosing participants in the trial. “We are reviewing and validating the data in collaboration with Merck in order to gain a better understanding of the interim trial results and make our formal decision regarding the execution of the trial,” Endocyte Chief Executive Ron Ellis said in the statement. Patients on the late-stage trial either received the drug in combination with a chemotherapy drug, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), or a combination of PLD plus a placebo. Baird’s Raymond said that Friday’s news can also raise questions on Endocyte’s entire technology platform. The company’s technology works by binding anti-cancer agents to certain receptors on cancer cells, thereby improving their efficacy. Apart from vintafolide, which is also being tested in lung and breast cancers, Endocyte is developing two more cancer drugs  based on the same technology. Endocyte and Merck signed a $1 billion partnership for the drug, also called Vynfinit, in April 2012. Endocyte’s shares were down 62 percent at $6.66 in late morning trading on the Nasdaq. Merck was down about 2 percent at $58.49. ",5022014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-merck-co-endocyte/endocytes-ovarian-cancer-drug-fails-trial-shares-sink-idUSKBN0DI15F20140502

548,MRK,DEALTALK-Big Pharma stands to profit by cleaning out its medicine chests,"(For more Reuters DEALTALKS, double click on ) By Ransdell Pierson NEW YORK, May 4 (Reuters) - Leading global pharmaceutical companies have started to view their vast portfolios of older, established prescription drugs as vehicles for raising large sums of cash to fuel development of new medicines with far higher profit margins. France’s Sanofi and U.S. drugmakers Merck & Co  and Abbott Laboratories are exploring selling off their mature drugs that have lost patent protection, Reuters reported this week, citing people familiar with the plans. Officials at the three companies declined to comment. The divestments could bring in more than $7 billion for Sanofi, north of $15 billion for Merck and over $5 billion for Abbott, the sources said, giving them considerable firepower to develop, or buy, promising experimental medicines. Such a shift would also remove a source of pricing pressure, since many of the older medicines are sold in emerging markets, where governments are increasingly demanding lower prices. “It makes sense to sell your low-growth assets that drag down profit margins and to redeploy that cash to higher-value innovative biotech assets,” said John Boris, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. The trickier part, according to some people familiar with the processes, is finding a buyer, particularly if many of these assets reach the market around the same time. Suitors could include generic or specialty drugmakers looking to widen their product line, or private equity firms content to milk the cash flow from the aging products without having to worry about the expense of drug development. The Merck products in particular could attract the interest of Valeant Pharmaceuticals, which derives a quarter of its revenue from branded generics sold in emerging markets, said Alex Arfaei, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets. Valeant’s Chief Executive Michael Pearson has said he favors established products over pumping cash into risky research and development projects. Once companies divest their mature drugs, good-selling patent-protected drugs can have a bigger impact on financial results, said Len Yaffe, portfolio manager of the healthcare fund at StockDoc Partners in San Francisco. Patent protection for a new drug is generally 20 years from the time the patent was approved, but it can then take a medicine 10 or more years to be developed and reach the market, giving a limited window for exclusivity. “From a smaller revenue base, it’s easier to grow revenue and earnings faster,” Yaffe said, especially as new drugs are approved and make contributions. The interest in unloading these older assets represents a shift for Big Pharma, which has relied on them as cash generators to cushion steep revenue declines from more recent drug patent expiries. Almost all are sold outside the United States, where governments are increasingly demanding lower prices. “That makes them less profitable and attractive,” said Morningstar analyst Debbie Wang. “It’s gotten tougher in the past two or three years.” The divestments would also feed into a larger shakeout of the pharma industry, whose major players are in the midst of a series of asset sales and swaps to better focus on the types of medicines that will bring them the most growth. That logic has fueled Pfizer Inc’s $106 billion unsolicited takeover bid for AstraZeneca and a $20 billion swap between Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline. Merck drugs likely to be sold include blood pressure treatments Cozaar and Hyzaar, with combined sales of $1 billion last year; cholesterol fighter Zocor, with sales of $301 million, and hair growth drug Propecia, with sales of $283 million. Sales of Abbott’s aging drugs, which it calls “established pharmaceuticals,” fell 3 percent last year to $4.97 billion, irking many investors. When GSK reported quarterly financial results on Wednesday, it announced separate results for its established products division. Pfizer on Monday is expected to do the same, as a possible prelude to eventually divesting its mature drugs. GSK last September sold two blood clot medicines that are branded generics, Arixtra and Fraxiparine, and a related factory, to South Africa’s Aspen Pharmacare for $1.1 billion, as part of its strategy to focus on growth products. “You should not be surprised if we were able to transact a disposal of some of that established product portfolio in the next year or two,” Chief Executive Andrew Witty told reporters last week. “That is not part of our future.” Pfizer, which recently spun off its animal health and infant formula businesses, is considering whether to divest its own established products unit, which includes hundreds of off-patent drugs and ones that will soon lose patent protection. Some analysts say an AstraZeneca purchase would allow Pfizer to combine the mature drugs divisions of both for a more significant sale or spin-off. But Pfizer has said it would not be able to divest the unit until 2017, following a review of its financial performance. It is one of the company’s three main businesses, and with revenue of $9.46 billion last year, it generated 18 percent of total Pfizer sales. There are clear risks for Merck, Sanofi and others, however, in concentrating their bets so much more heavily on the success of new medicines “Being more focused cuts both ways: your successes are magnified, but if you have failures, you feel them more when you have a less-diverse business,” said Edward Jones analyst Judson Clark.

549,MRK,Merck executives say not tempted by merger mania,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co (MRK.N) Chief Executive Kenneth Frazier said he does not expect a wave of giant mergers in the drug industry despite a spate of recent activity, adding that Merck will seek out promising medicines rather than lower taxes in any future deals. “I don’t see an arms race” in the industry “although different companies are sizing up their own (drug) portfolios and growth prospects and some feel they will be enhanced through combinations,” Frazier said in a telephone interview after a company meeting with investors in Boston. Earlier on Tuesday Merck announced the sale of its own array of consumer care products to Germany’s Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE) for $14.2 billion. Sale of the products, including brands such as Coppertone sunscreen, MiraLAX laxative and Claritin allergy pills, will allow Merck to focus on its more-lucrative prescription drugs business. Frazier is no stranger to mega-mergers, having been head of Merck’s pharmaceuticals operations when the company paid $41 billion in 2009 to buy U.S. rival Schering-Plough Corp. He became CEO of Merck in 2011. The industry’s merger pace had fallen off until recent weeks, when a series of large deals and takeover attempts emerged, highlighted by Pfizer Inc’s (PFE.N) now-$106 billion unsolicited bid for British drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L). Pfizer aims to buy AstraZeneca and domicile the combined company in the United Kingdom to take advantage of lower corporate tax rates, a growing trend called tax inversions. Frazier said his company was not interested in such financial engineering. “Tax inversions clearly have value, but what motivates us is to bring medically important products to patients,” he said. Adam Schechter, Merck’s head of global human health who oversaw the integration of Schering-Plough, does not expect Merck to enter into another major acquisition in the foreseeable future, although that may be wishful thinking on his part. “It takes a lot of effort and energy to try to pull two big companies together. Having done it once, it’s not something you look forward to doing ever again,” he said. “We realize that we have to pay attention to things that are going on around us and take notice. We would be interested in looking at bolt-ons,” he said, referring to smaller acquisitions. Asked about reports that Merck was considering selling its portfolio of older branded drugs no longer under patent protection, Schechter said those so-called diversified products were vital to Merck’s growth in emerging markets, where there tends to be a preference for known brands over generics. “It’s also a part of manufacturing and how we have our facilities organized, so it’s not easy to think of a way just to pull that out,” he said. Merck believes developing markets, with their burgeoning middle classes, will continue to be an important growth driver for the number two U.S. drugmaker, he said.

Bayer, the inventor of aspirin and maker of Bepanthen skin care products and Canesten antifungal creams, has repeatedly said it wants to take the top spot in the rankings. Drug makers have embarked on a major reshuffling of their business portfolios. Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) last month agreed to trade more than $20 billion worth of assets, while AstraZeneca is fighting off a $106 billion takeover approach from Pfizer. Meanwhile companies including France’s Sanofi, Merck & Co and Abbott are looking at selling off mature drugs that have lost patent protection. OTC drugs units carry far lower margins than prescription drugs businesses but many drug majors regard them as attractive complements due to the stable stream of cash they can generate. They akso require less spending on research and development and can be less exposed to the loss of patent protection where consumers remain loyal to a brand even when cheap copies become available. But Reckitt Benckiser Group, one of the final contenders in Merck’s auction, said on April 30 it was no longer in active talks to buy the Merck business, leaving Bayer in pole position. Bayer also edged out other rival bidders, including Procter & Gamble Co, Boehringer Ingelheim, Novartis and Sanofi , people familiar with the matter have said.

Merck & Co has around 1 percent with brands including Dr Scholl foot care, Coppertone sunscreen and Claritin allergy medicine.    The fragmented OTC industry is consolidating fast. Novartis and GSK will form a joint venture in consumer healthcare as part of their agreement last month. That deal is set to elevate the combined group, with $9.5 billion in sales, to the top of the global consumer health ranking, overtaking Johnson & Johnson and Bayer. But Bayer said the Merck deal will put it back on the second rung, with $7.4 billion in combined sales. J&J;’s consumer unit has $14.7 billion but market observers exclude many of its products, such as Listerine mouth wash, from their analysis of the OTC market. With Bayer paying 6.5 times 2013 revenue and 21 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), analysts at Deutsche Bank said the price tag may seem “eye-watering” at first sight. “The deal works both strategically and financially, and creates value (albeit to a modest degree),” the analysts said, adding it reduces volatility in the Bayer business and provides a predictable cash flow. Bayer’s enlarged consumer care unit will account for about 13 percent of group sales, up from 10 percent now.

554,MRK,UPDATE 3-Bayer wins Merck & Co's $14 bln consumer unit auction,"* Bayer to become OTC drug market’s second biggest operator * Merck expects after-tax proceeds of between $8-$9 bln * Largest German healthcare deal since Schering takeover * Bayer sells some rights to lung drug for up to $2.1 bln   (Adds details on industry ranking, shares, comment by analyst) By Ludwig Burger FRANKFURT, May 6 (Reuters) - Germany’s Bayer AG  has trumped rival bidders for Merck & Co Inc’s consumer care business in a $14.2 billion deal, adding to a string of major cross-border deals in the healthcare industry. “This acquisition marks a major milestone on our path towards global leadership in the attractive non-prescription medicines business,” Bayer’s chief executive, Marijn Dekkers,  said in a statement on Tuesday. Merck, which is selling non-prescription brands such as the MiraLAX laxative and Afrin cold remedy, said it expects after-tax proceeds of between $8 billion and $9 billion from the sale, which is expected to close in the second half of 2014. The transaction, the largest in the German healthcare industry since Bayer bought rival Schering for 17 billion euros ($24 billion) in 2006, will make Bayer the world’s second-biggest consumer healthcare company, as it seeks to make better use of its distribution network and sales force. “We can take these products and market them more forcefully than Merck has been able to do so far,” Dekkers said in a conference call with analysts. Bayer, the inventor of aspirin and maker of Bepanthen skin care products and Canesten antifungal creams, has repeatedly said it wants to take the top spot in the rankings. Drug makers have embarked on a major reshuffling of their business portfolios. Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) last month agreed to trade more than $20 billion worth of assets, while AstraZeneca is fighting off a $106 billion takeover approach from Pfizer. Meanwhile companies including France’s Sanofi, Merck & Co and Abbott are looking at selling off mature drugs that have lost patent protection. OTC drugs units carry far lower margins than prescription drugs businesses but many drug majors regard them as attractive complements due to the stable stream of cash they can generate. They akso require less spending on research and development and can be less exposed to the loss of patent protection where consumers remain loyal to a brand even when cheap copies become available. But Reckitt Benckiser Group, one of the final contenders in Merck’s auction, said on April 30 it was no longer in active talks to buy the Merck business, leaving Bayer in pole position. Bayer also edged out other rival bidders, including Procter & Gamble Co, Boehringer Ingelheim, Novartis and Sanofi , people familiar with the matter have said. J&J; commands about 4 percent of the consumer health market - worth nearly $200 billion at the retail level. Merck & Co has around 1 percent with brands including Dr Scholl foot care, Coppertone sunscreen and Claritin allergy medicine. The fragmented OTC industry is consolidating fast. Novartis and GSK will form a joint venture in consumer healthcare as part of their agreement last month. That deal is set to elevate the combined group, with $9.5 billion in sales, to the top of the global consumer health ranking, overtaking Johnson & Johnson and Bayer. But Bayer said the Merck deal will put it back on the second rung, with $7.4 billion in combined sales. J&J;’s consumer unit has $14.7 billion but market observers exclude many of its products, such as Listerine mouth wash, from their analysis of the OTC market. With Bayer paying 6.5 times 2013 revenue and 21 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), analysts at Deutsche Bank said the price tag may seem “eye-watering” at first sight. “The deal works both strategically and financially, and creates value (albeit to a modest degree),” the analysts said, adding it reduces volatility in the Bayer business and provides a predictable cash flow. Bayer’s enlarged consumer care unit will account for about 13 percent of group sales, up from 10 percent now. Bayer’s shares closed 0.9 percent lower at 99.07 euros, while the STOXX Europe 600 health care index slipped 0.4 percent.

556,MRK,"Merck to seek approval of osteoporosis drug, cites safety risks","(Reuters) - Merck & Co said on Tuesday it plans to seek marketing approvals this year for an osteoporosis drug and a product to reverse the effects of anesthesia that have long been delayed by safety concerns. The No. 2 U.S. drugmaker will seek approval in the second half of the year for odanacatib, its experimental treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, and will seek approval in 2014 for sugammadex, meant to reverse the effects of muscle relaxants after surgery. Merck shares were down 2 percent at $57.50 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company is counting on odanacatib, sugammadex and other experimental drugs, including promising treatments for hepatitis C and cancer, to boost its earnings growth following generic competition for its Singulair asthma treatment and other brands. But Merck research chief, Roger Perlmutter, in a company meeting with investors in Boston to review research projects, said a numerically higher incidence of stroke and atrial fibrillation - a type of irregular heartbeat most common in the elderly - was seen in patients taking odanacatib than those taking placebos in studies.  Perlmutter also said a type of skin thickening and itching called morphea was seen in 0.2 percent of patients taking odanacatib. He said 0.1 percent of patients had fractures in the shaft of the femur, or thigh bone, a greater incidence than seen in the placebo group. ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said the half-day Merck research meeting had been relatively uneventful, except for news that Merck would seek approval this year for odanacatib. “That’s an upside surprise,” he said in a research note. “But the news was tempered perhaps by their disclosure that there was a numerical imbalance in atrial fibrillation and stroke” and there were skin issues. Analysts at Cowen and Co have predicted that odanacatib, if approved, could reap Merck annual sales of $1 billion by 2020.  Odanacatib works through a new mechanism of action, by blocking a protein called cathespin K, and would compete with widely used older drugs called bisphosphonates that include Merck’s own Fosamax. Bisphosphonates, leading treatments for osteoporosis, have raised concern because of rare cases of disintegration of jaw bone as well as femur fractures. Merck said the jaw condition had not been seen with odanacatib. Merck last year said it was delaying its application for odanacatib because it needed additional data from a clinical trial. As for sugammadex, the FDA declined to approve the injectable product in 2008, citing concerns about its possible association with allergic reactions and bleeding.  Sugammadex has already been approved in more than 50 countries, where it is sold under the brand name Bridion. It generated worldwide sales of $73 million in the first quarter. But analysts believe the medicine, if approved in the United States, could generate annual sales of $500 million or more. Earlier on Tuesday, Merck said it would sell its consumer healthcare business for $14.2 billion to Germany’s Bayer AG, adding to a string of major cross-border deals in the healthcare industry. Merck’s consumer brands include Dr Scholl foot care, Coppertone sunscreen and its Claritin allergy medicine. They were acquired from Merck’s 2009 purchase of U.S. drugmaker Schering-Plough.

559,MRK,"In AstraZeneca fight, valuing drugs as much art as science","* AstraZeneca forecasts show variables in drug modelling * $45 bln sales prediction widely seen as over-optimistic By Ben Hirschler LONDON, May 7 (Reuters) - Ten-year sales forecasts from AstraZeneca - a central plank of its defence against a $106 billion bid approach from Pfizer - underscore how valuing drugs is an art as well as a science. While imponderables exist in any corporate valuation, pharmaceuticals are especially tricky, given the hazards of drug development and the long timelines of an industry where it typically takes 10 to 15 years to bring a new product to market. AstraZeneca’s prediction of sales above $45 billion by 2023 was widely seen as over-optimistic by industry analysts who have a more conservative view on many of the myriad factors that feed into modelling future drug sales. One thing is certain: most experimental drugs fail. The average new drug has just a 6 percent chance of making it to market when it enters initial Phase I testing in humans, according to Thomson Reuters CMR International, which specialises in measuring pharmaceutical R&D; performance. This rises to 69 percent by the time a new medicine reaches final Phase III clinical trials, and 90 percent once it is submitted for regulatory approval. “There will be things in our pipeline that won’t work - that’s par for the course,” Briggs Morrison, AstraZeneca’s global head of medicines development, said on Wednesday. Nonetheless, Morrison, who worked for Pfizer until 2012, believes his colleagues at AstraZeneca have honed the art of predicting future sales by blending the factors behind a new drug’s commercial success. The first pass involves evaluating the technical aspects of whether a medicine actually works, followed by judging whether wary regulators are likely to give it a green light, and then finally assessing its likely market share and pricing. Given the many variables and the risk of over-promising and under-delivering, most drug companies prefer not to make long-term sales forecasts in normal times. But these are not normal times for AstraZeneca, and it hopes that by sharing key parts of its internal Long Range Plan, prepared for the board each year, it can prove it is worth a lot more than the 50 pounds per share offered by Pfizer. For investors, pharmaceutical investment remains to a large degree a game of molecular roulette. Skimming through a 44-slide presentation on the new forecasts this week, AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot acknowledged the uncertainties but argued his group had one of the most compelling and visible pipelines in the industry. He compared his forecasts to those made by Genentech before it was acquired by Roche in 2009. In that case, the numbers were achieved, but the sales did not all come from the expected products. Overall, AstraZeneca believes its drug pipeline has a 36 percent chance of success, with potential peak annual sales of $63 billion translating to $23 billion on a risk-adjusted basis. But the success rate varies hugely from product to product. Alzheimer’s drug AZD3293, which is about to enter Phase III testing and could in theory have annual sales of $5 billion, has a mere 9 percent probability of success, while the Phase III inhaled lung drug PT003 has a better than two-thirds chance. Competitors, too, can skew prospects. AstraZeneca’s benralizumab for severe asthma, for example, faces a rival biotech drug from GlaxoSmithKline, and clinical trials for both will ultimately determine if it is a hit or a miss. Pricing is another major uncertainty, especially in specialty medicines where prices have gone through the roof in recent years, sparking a backlash in areas like hepatitis C. Morrison said AstraZeneca’s forecasts assumed more pricing pressure over time, but he acknowledged there was a risk. “It’s a problem - let’s be candid,” he said. “You need creative ways of pricing that society will feel offer fair value.” That is relevant in the hot field of cancer medicine, where AstraZeneca is chasing Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck & Co  and Roche in the emerging field of immuno-oncology, which involves using drugs to boost the body’s immune system. AstraZeneca said it broadly agreed with forecasts that immuno-oncology could be a $28-35 billion a year market - but those numbers assume no dislocation in the current market that prices some cancer drugs at more than $100,000 per patient. Overall, AstraZeneca expects the pipeline to make up a third of sales by 2023, with the balance coming from existing drugs, where market expectations are more solid but still far from certain. The company’s 2023 forecast for sales of $3.5 billion of heart drug Brilinta, for example, is far higher than the $1.3 billion consensus forecast for 2018 sales - a big gap that leaves many analysts scratching their heads.

561,MRK,U.S. FDA approves Merck blood clot preventer,"May 8 (Reuters) - U.S. health regulators on Thursday approved a blood clot preventer developed by Merck & Co  for use by patients who have had a heart attack or who suffer from blockages in the arteries of the legs. The drug, vorapaxar, was approved to reduce the risk of heart attacks, stroke, cardiovascular death and the need for procedures to improve blood flow to the heart, the Food and Drug Administration said. Merck will sell the new medicine under the brand name Zontivity. The approval follows a recommendation for its use by an FDA advisory panel that voted 10-1 in favor of the drug in January. The approval had been delayed over safety concerns due to serious and sometimes fatal bleeding in patients who were given the drug in clinical trials. Zontivity is not approved for use in patients who have suffered a stroke, as those patients were found to be at particularly high risk of dangerous bleeding. “In patients who have had a heart attack or who have peripheral arterial disease, this drug will lower the risk of heart attack, stroke, and cardiovascular death,” Ellis Unger, director of the Office of Drug Evaluation I in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. Zontivity works by preventing platelets in the blood from clumping together and forming clots in the arteries, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. Each year about 190,000 Americans have a second heart-related event, according to Merck. Zontivity is expected to be used in addition to standard therapy given to prevent a second heart attack - typically aspirin and the clot preventer Plavix.

564,MRK,"Bristol, Merck, Roche immune therapies are cancer meeting focus","(Reuters) - When the world’s leading cancer doctors meet in Chicago next month, new treatments from Merck & Co, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Roche Holding AG that help the immune system fight disease are expected to capture much of the spotlight.  The drugs, known as anti-PD-1 or anti-PDL1 therapies, are biotech medicines that work by blocking a tumor’s ability to camouflage itself, thereby allowing T cells in the immune system to recognize and attack the cancer. They have shown great promise against advanced melanoma - the deadliest of skin cancers - as well as advanced lung and kidney cancers, with relatively mild side effects, generating  excitement among researchers and investors.  At the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago beginning May 30, researchers will for the first time present data on Roche’s anti-PDL1 drug in advanced bladder cancer for which there have been few advances in decades.  Merck will have no less than 16 studies involving its highly touted anti PD-1 drug, MK-3475, including a first look at the drug as an initial lung cancer treatment. Early data released on Wednesday showed 36 percent of 45 patients had an initial immune response to the treatment. Merck will also provide results from the first trial of the drug in head and neck cancer. Brief summaries, or abstracts, of thousands of studies to be presented at the ASCO meeting were released on Wednesday.  “This area should represent a major advance in cancer therapy and patient survivability,” said Len Yaffe, portfolio manager for the healthcare fund StockDoc Partners. “Wall Street is increasingly recognizing the multibillion-dollar potential for cancer immunotherapies.” The potential for lasting effects of these drugs will be on display in a pair of studies involving the Bristol-Myers anti PD-1 drug nivolumab. Researchers will present follow-up data from a 107-patient nivolumab study in metastatic melanoma showing that 41 percent were still alive after three years, an apparent leveling off from the 48 percent survival rate after two years. Three-year survival with advanced melanoma was virtually unheard of prior to the advent of cancer immunotherapy. In a trial of patients whose advanced kidney cancer had progressed following prior treatments, the mean overall survival was 25.5 months for the 2 milligram nivolumab dose. Past kidney cancer studies of drugs currently in use have demonstrated a mean survival of about 14 months, said Fouad Namouni, Bristol’s head of global development for nivolumab. As drugmakers face greater scrutiny over how they price new therapies - with immuno-oncology expected to be among the most expensive - several studies will aim to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from the new treatments. Researchers can now perform a test to determine the degree to which the PD-L1 protein is expressed on the surface of cancer cells. On a 0 to 3 scale, a score of 0 or 1 is considered PD-L1 negative, while 2 or 3 is deemed PD-L1 positive. If early data is confirmed in larger trials, this class of immunotherapies could become standalone treatments for some patients, while PD-L1 negative patients may require combination or alternative therapies, according to some researchers. In a small, Phase I study of Bristol’s nivolumab in previously untreated patients with advanced lung cancer, five out of 10 PD-L1 positive patients saw their tumors shrink by at least 30 percent. No such responses were seen among 7 PD-L1 negative patients. Roche also saw half of the 20 PD-L1 positive patients in its bladder cancer trial respond to its drug. Namouni said Bristol would focus on PD-L1 positive patients only in a large Phase III lung cancer trial of previously untreated subjects. Its Phase III studies of those who had received prior treatments will include PD-L1 negative patients.

Merck will have no less than 16 studies involving its highly touted anti PD-1 drug, MK-3475, including a first look at the drug as an initial lung cancer treatment. Early data released on Wednesday showed 36 percent of 45 patients had an initial immune response to the treatment. Merck will also provide results from the first trial of the drug in head and neck cancer. Brief summaries, or abstracts, of thousands of studies to be presented at the ASCO meeting were released on Wednesday. “This area should represent a major advance in cancer therapy and patient survivability,” said Len Yaffe, portfolio manager for the healthcare fund StockDoc Partners. “Wall Street is increasingly recognizing the multibillion-dollar potential for cancer immunotherapies.” The potential for lasting effects of these drugs will be on display in a pair of studies involving the Bristol-Myers  anti PD-1 drug nivolumab. Researchers will present follow-up data from a 107-patient nivolumab study in metastatic melanoma showing that 41 percent were still alive after three years, an apparent leveling off from the 48 percent survival rate after two years. Three-year survival with advanced melanoma was virtually unheard of prior to the advent of cancer immunotherapy. In a trial of patients whose advanced kidney cancer had progressed following prior treatments, the mean overall survival was 25.5 months for the 2 milligram nivolumab dose. Past kidney cancer studies of drugs currently in use have demonstrated a mean survival of about 14 months, said Fouad Namouni, Bristol’s head of global development for nivolumab.

Researchers can now perform a test to determine the degree to which the PD-L1 protein is expressed on the surface of cancer cells. On a 0 to 3 scale, a score of 0 or 1 is considered PD-L1 negative, while 2 or 3 is deemed PD-L1 positive. If early data is confirmed in larger trials, this class of immunotherapies could become standalone treatments for some patients, while PD-L1 negative patients may require combination or alternative therapies, according to some researchers. In a small, Phase I study of Bristol’s nivolumab in previously untreated patients with advanced lung cancer, five out of 10 PD-L1 positive patients saw their tumors shrink by at least 30 percent.

566,MRK,"Bristol, Merck, Roche immune therapies are cancer meeting darlings","May 14 (Reuters) - When the world’s leading cancer doctors meet in Chicago next month, new treatments from Merck & Co, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Roche Holding AG that help the immune system fight disease are expected to capture much of the spotlight. The drugs, known as anti-PD-1 or anti-PDL1 therapies, are biotech medicines that work by blocking a tumor’s ability to camouflage itself, thereby allowing T cells in the immune system to recognize and attack the cancer.

Boston Scientific said the business, called Bayer Interventional, will help it expand its portfolio of devices for cardiology, radiology and peripheral vascular procedures. “This transaction will enable us to reach more effectively the more than 27 million patients worldwide who suffer from the debilitating effects of peripheral vascular disease,” it said, referring to the obstruction of large blood vessels, typically in arms or legs. The all-cash deal is expected to close in the second half of 2014. Bayer’s HealthCare unit last week trumped rival bidders for Merck & Co’s consumer care business in a $14.2 billion deal. The German group has previously said it would seek growth in the areas of life science and molecular sciences. “With this sale, our Medical Care division can concentrate on innovation and growth in radiology and diabetes care, where we already have a strong presence,” Olivier Brandicourt, CEO of Bayer HealthCare, said in a statement. The catheter business, which achieved sales of about $120 million last year, will become part of Boston Scientific’s existing Peripheral Interventions business, the U.S. company said.

569,MRK,"UPDATE 1-Sanofi, Lilly pursue Cialis over-the-counter approval","(Adds background on Cialis, Viagra, regulatory issues) NEW YORK, May 28 (Reuters) - Sanofi and Eli Lilly and Co on Wednesday said they would ask health regulators for permission to sell Cialis, the world’s top-selling anti-impotence drug, without a prescription. Currently available by prescription only, the tablet was first approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2002 and then by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2003. It is one of Lilly’s biggest products, having generated almost $2.2 billion in worldwide sales last year. The drug is also approved to treat enlarged prostate glands. Under the terms of the agreement, Sanofi is buying the exclusive rights to apply for approval of Cialis tablets over the counter in the United States, Europe, Canada and Australia. Terms of the licensing agreement were not disclosed. The tablet would be sold by Sanofi’s consumer healthcare unit, which had sales last year of $4.1 billion from a wide array of non-prescription brands, including vitamins and treatments for allergies, coughs, colds and the flu. It remains to be seen, however, whether regulators will allow Cialis to be sold without a prescription, in view of possible side effects. Like rival anti-impotence drugs, such as Pfizer Inc’s Viagra, Cialis can cause a dangerous fall in blood pressure if taken with nitrates, a class of heart drugs that include nitroglycerin. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in weighing whether to allow prescription drugs to be sold over the counter, weighs whether patients are able to understand complex aspects of their disease, or exactly when to take the drug to ensure safe use. The FDA in 2008, for instance, rejected Merck & Co’s  bid to sell its Mevacor cholesterol-lowering drug without a prescription, after an independent panel of medical experts expressed concern that patients might take it instead of more-effective newer medicines. Cialis will face competition from cheaper generics in the United States in 2017, the same year that Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries is expected to begin selling generic prescription forms of Viagra under an agreement reached with Pfizer last year. Viagra, the first drug to treat impotence, was approved by U.S. regulators in 1998. It has annual sales of about $1.5 billion.

570,MRK,"Merck immune system-booster effective in skin, lung cancer","(Reuters) - A highly anticipated new immunotherapy from Merck & Co Inc proved effective in patients with advanced melanoma as well as some with lung cancer or head and neck cancer, according to early-stage studies presented on Monday. Merck filed in January for U.S. Food and Drug approval of MK3475, now known as pembrolizumab, as a treatment for melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. But the drug’s biggest sales opportunity is expected to be in treating lung cancer, which causes the most cancer deaths in the United States each year. The drug is part of an emerging class of medications that work by blocking a protein called PD-1, or Programmed Death receptor, used by cancer cells to evade the body’s immune system. Morningstar has estimated that Merck’s peak annual sales of pembrolizumab could reach $6 billion. A Phase I study in 411 patients with melanoma that had spread to other parts of the body found that 69 percent were alive after a year of treatment. At 18 months, researchers estimated that overall survival was 62 percent, with some patients on the drug for more than two years. The findings were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago. Patients with metastatic melanoma often have high levels of PD-L1 protein in their tumors. When PD-L1 attaches to its receptor PD-1 on immune cells, tumors are able to hide from the immune system; drugs that target either PD-L1 or PD-1 inhibit this interaction. More than half the patients in the melanoma trial had previously been treated with ipilimumab, which is sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co under the brand name Yervoy. It is part of a class known as CTLA-4 blockers that work by unleashing a different part of the immune system. Overall, 34 percent of patients had tumor shrinkage after treatment with Merck’s drug, including 40 percent not treated with ipilimumab and 28 percent whose cancer worsened despite ipilimumab.  The most common immune-related adverse events included thyroid problems. Four percent of patients stopped treatment due to side effects. “In general, this is probably the safest drug I have ever used in metastatic melanoma patients,” said Dr Antoni Ribas, professor of hematology-oncology at the University of California, Los Angeles and the study’s lead investigator. A separate arm of the trial - 45 previously untreated patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who tested positive for PD-L1 - showed by one measurement that 47 percent had tumor shrinkage. A different measurement showed that 26 percent of those patients responded to the drug. Two different methods were used because standard measures can underestimate the impact of drugs that work by targeting the immune system, said Dr Alise Reicin, Merck vice president oncology. She estimated that around 70 percent of advanced non small-cell lung cancer patients have tumors that express PD-L1. Merck said the median duration of response had not been reached in the lung cancer trial, with some patients continuing on the drug for at least a year. Results for a trial segment involving 217 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who had previously been treated with other drugs were slated for presentation at the ASCO meeting on Tuesday. Dr Reicin declined to comment on when Merck would file for regulatory approval of pembrolizumab as a treatment for lung cancer. The company did say it plans to launch in September a Phase III study comparing the drug to chemotherapy in previously-untreated patients with PD-L1 positive, advanced NSCLC. Merck on Sunday presented data from a small number of patients with advanced head and neck cancer who were treated with pembrolizumab. Of the patients deemed to be high expressers of PD-L1, 45 percent experienced tumor shrinkage, compared with 11 percent for the overall group. The FDA is slated to decide by late October whether to approve pembrolizumab for patients with advanced melanoma previously treated with ipilimumab. Merck is studying pembrolizumab across more than 30 types of cancers, as a stand-alone treatment and in combination with other drugs.

574,MRK,Former Merck dealmaker takes aim at colon germ,"(Reuters) - An infectious disease expert and former head dealmaker at Merck & Co is racing against his ex-employer and other drugmakers to develop a treatment for a germ that ravages the colon and kills as many as 14,000 Americans each year. Roger Pomerantz on Monday became chief executive officer of privately held Seres Health, whose lead product has proven highly effective against the c. difficile bacteria in early-stage clinical trials.  The condition occurs in patients who have been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics that kill off “friendly” bacteria in the gut, allowing c. difficile to take root and prosper there. It causes colitis, including serious diarrhea and fever that can recur and are not well-controlled by current treatments.  The infections, which are most dangerous for the elderly and others with weakened immune systems, typically occur in hospitals, nursing homes and doctor’s offices, but are becoming more common in the community at large. Some industry analysts have said effective treatments against c. difficile could have blockbuster sales potential.   The Seres oral capsule, called SER 109, in early clinical trials quickly eliminated symptoms in more than 90 percent of patients, Pomerantz said in a telephone interview. All patients previously had multiple recurrences of c. difficile after standard antibiotic treatments such as vancomycin and metronidazole. Rather than killing c. difficile, SER 109, which contains spores from bacteria initially harvested from human stool, restores balance to the microbiome, where millions of types of bacteria interact in the colon, Pomerantz said. “There’s no ick factor,” he said. “There’s no stool in our capsules, just (bacterial) spores” that have been replicated countless times on laboratory dishes, refined and purified. Mid-stage trials of SER 109 involve about 40 patients and are being conducted at numerous centers, including the Mayo Clinic and Massachusetts General Hospital. They should be completed in the next six weeks, after which Seres aims to conduct late-stage studies, Pomerantz said.  “We have multiple large pharmaceutical companies interested in our company,” Pomerantz said, but he would not comment about any possible licensing plans.  Merck’s injectable treatment, called MK-3415A, is a combination of two monoclonal antibodies that do not target c. difficile itself but instead block toxins produced by the germ. It is now in late-stage studies.  Pomerantz, who once headed infectious disease research for Johnson & Johnson, joined Merck in 2010 in a similar capacity. Soon afterward he took charge of business development, overseeing licensing deals and acquisitions. But he left Merck last summer after an executive reshuffling and in November became chairman of Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Seres, a role he retains. Pomerantz said SER 109 and other Seres products also could treat diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome, diseases the microbiome is believed to affect.

578,MRK,Merck & Co to buy Idenix to boost hepatitis C drugs portfolio,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc MRK.N said Monday it would buy Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc IDIX.O for $3.85 billion and plans to combine the two companies’ most promising drugs to produce a faster, more effective cure for hepatitis C. Merck said it would pay $24.50 per share, more than three times Idenix’s Friday closing price of $7.23. The payoff for Merck could come from a triple therapy that may cure patients with all genotypes, or strains, of the hepatitis C virus in as little as four to six weeks, its research chief, Roger Perlmutter, said in an interview. “An ideal therapy means something that works in every hepatitis C-infected patient, irrespective of which genotype,” Perlmutter said. “Our goal is to cure everyone quickly using an oral regimen.” The deal comes as drugmakers aim to better compete with Gilead Sciences Inc’s GILD.O Sovaldi, an $84,000 treatment approved in December that generated an unprecedented $2.3 billion in sales in the first few months on the market. The cost of Sovaldi, which cures well in excess of 90 percent of patients in as little as 8 weeks of treatment, has drawn sharp criticism from insurers and government officials. (Full Story) Idenix has three drugs in development to treat hepatitis C, most notably a pill in early-stage trials called IDX21437. Like Sovaldi, it is a nucleotide inhibitor - or “nuc” - that blocks a protein needed by the hepatitis C virus to replicate. Merck hopes to combine IDX21437 with its two high-profile experimental oral treatments, a protease inhibitor called MK-5172 and a so-called NS5A inhibitor called MK-8742 that together received a “breakthrough therapy” designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. (Full Story) In a recent mid-stage trial, Merck’s two-drug combo cured 98 percent of previously untreated patients with genotype 1, the most common and hardest to treat variant of hepatitis C. The Idenix drug in earlier studies has shown effectiveness against all six main genotypes of hepatitis C, without raising serious safety concerns that have dogged other drugs in its class. Bristol Myers paid $2.5 billion for Inhibitex to get its nuc, but scrapped the drug in 2012 after serious side effects were seen in trials. Hepatitis C drugs have a history of being expensive, largely because some 170 million people worldwide have the often-fatal liver disease and have not had good treatment options. Bristol paid a 163 percent premium for Inhibitex. Gilead acquired Sovaldi by agreeing in 2011 to pay $11 billion in cash for biotech company Pharmasset, an 89 percent premium for a company with no marketed products. Perlmutter said Merck hopes the triple combination will cure patients in 4 to 6 weeks, substantially more quickly than current treatments and those in clinical trials. Leerink Partners analyst Seamus Fernandez said IDX21437 has not shown any of the skeletal or cardiac toxicity signals that were seen with Bristol’s failed drug. Moreover, he said safety of the Idenix drug, at least from preclinical studies, looks very similar to Sovaldi. “Merck’s presentation supports a much larger and longer market opportunity in hepatitis C” than expected, justifying the price of the deal, Baird Equity Research analyst Brian Skorney said in a research note. Merck and Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Idenix said they expected the transaction to close in the third quarter. Idenix said in March it was involved in a patent dispute with Gilead related to its hepatitis C treatment in Oslo, Norway.

584,MRK,Merck open to more biotech deals: research chief,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc’s (MRK.N) research chief Roger Perlmutter said the No. 2 U.S. drugmaker would consider big acquisitions of biotech companies for their medicines, rather than to obtain their drug-development technologies. Perlmutter, speaking on Thursday to analysts and investors at the annual Goldman Sachs healthcare conference being held near Los Angeles, said Merck continues to have an appetite for deals following its planned $3.85 billion purchase of Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc IDIX.O. Merck earlier this week announced its agreement to buy Idenix, and  plans to combine the two companies’ most promising oral drugs for hepatitis C to produce a faster, more effective cure for the often-fatal liver infection affecting 170 million people worldwide. Perlmutter on Thursday said Merck has been a pioneer in development of hepatitis C drugs, including injectable interferon medicines that had been the backbone of therapy but which are now being sidelined in favor of more effective and better-tolerated drugs. He said newer Merck drugs, including a hoped-for triple therapy using an experimental Idenix treatment called IDX21437, will make Merck a top hepatitis C competitor in years to come. “The best (drug) regimen that has a fair cost proposition will take a substantial part of the market and that’s where I want to be,” he said. Perlmutter could not immediately be reached by Reuters for further comment, including what he meant by “fair cost proposition.” The company’s shares were little change at $58.30 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

586,MRK,"Merck, Pfizer, HSBC could be big winners from shareholder case","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Within the next two weeks, the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule in a major case that could make it much harder for shareholders to band together against public companies in securities fraud class actions.  If the court rules in favor of Halliburton (HAL.N) and against a group of shareholders, then the oilfield services company won’t be the only business to gain. A handful of other major companies would also likely reap immediate benefit. Those companies, including drug makers Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), banks HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA.L) and Regions Financial Corp (RF.N), and casino company Las Vegas Sands Corp (LVS.N), are defendants in shareholder lawsuits that have been granted class action status.  A decision setting a higher bar for class actions would not end the lawsuits, but it would allow these defendants to file briefs demanding that shareholders have to again seek court approval for the status - and this time under a new, tougher standard. If they fail to get that approval, the cases would effectively end. In 2013, settlements were reached in 67 cases totaling $4.8 billion, according to Cornerstone Research. A ruling in the oil company’s favor in Halliburton v. Erica P. John Fund could save other businesses facing pending class actions hundreds of millions of dollars collectively.  Around 200 shareholder class actions are filed every year alleging that misleading statements and material omissions made by companies and their executives caused a stock’s share price to drop. Nearly 400 shareholder securities class actions are  pending in various stages of litigation, according to data gathered by the Stanford Law School Securities Class Action Clearinghouse. But only a relatively small number of the pending cases have been granted class action status. In each instance, a judge must determine at a certification hearing whether the status is appropriate. One consideration is whether the people in the class have common issues or merely related ones. To be a class, they must have common issues. Class certification is a critical stage in shareholder class actions because it puts pressure on defendants to settle by increasing the liability they face. Generally, the larger the class size, the more damages a company faces and the more that plaintiffs’ lawyers can make. Law firms can receive as much as a third of the settlement in attorneys’ fees. In the case before the Supreme Court, Halliburton is seeking to overturn a 1988 decision, Basic v. Levinson, which adopted the “fraud on the market theory.” Under the theory, a defendant’s material misrepresentation that affects the price of publicly traded securities is presumed to have been relied on by a purchaser who suffered a loss. That theory assumes public information about a company is known to the market and plaintiffs do not have to show that they relied on a specific misrepresentation, only that they purchased shares before the truth came out. In the case against Halliburton, shareholders alleged it understated asbestos liabilities while overstating both  revenues in its engineering and construction business and the benefits of its merger with Dresser Industries.  The court has several options, including leaving intact Basic v. Levinson to maintain the status quo. At the other extreme, it could overturn Basic v. Levinson - and so doom securities class actions by requiring plaintiffs to show they relied on misinformation when they purchased securities. A third option would be to find a middle ground that would require plaintiffs to show that the misrepresentation had a significant effect on the stock price but that would not overturn Basic. During oral arguments, some of the justices appeared to signal that the middle option would be their preference.  The middle option would still be a win for the defendant corporations by creating more hurdles for shareholders to clear before being allowed to sue as a group. Merck is facing one of the largest pending shareholder cases that already has class action status.  The lawsuit, filed in 2005, alleges that the company made misleading statements about its painkiller drug Vioxx, which the company withdrew from the market in 2004 over concerns that it increased the risk of heart attacks and strokes. The plaintiffs alleged that after Merck disclosed the problems with Vioxx, its market capitalization shrunk by billions of dollars. In January 2013, U.S. District Judge Stanley Chesler of New Jersey certified a class of individuals and entities who purchased Merck securities from May 21, 1999, to Sept. 29, 2004. Foreshadowing the potential impact of the Halliburton decision, a lawyer for Merck in November asked a federal judge in New Jersey to put a halt to proceedings in the case pending the outcome of the Supreme Court decision in Halliburton. The lawyer said the plaintiffs’ case rested squarely on the fraud on the market theory and that part of the case would likely have to be re-litigated following the Halliburton decision.  The court denied the request.  Merck and an attorney for the plaintiffs had no comment on the potential impact of Halliburton on the case. HSBC could also benefit from the Supreme Court’s ruling. The bank is appealing a $2.46 billion judgment against one of the company’s units, formerly known as Household International Inc. The plaintiffs alleged that Household was engaged in systemic predatory lending and that it misrepresented the credit quality of its loan portfolio. The judgment, entered by a federal judge in Chicago last year, was the largest ever following a securities fraud class action trial, according to the plaintiffs’ law firm. On appeal to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, lawyers for HSBC are seeking an order vacating the judgment and sending the case back to the district court. In a brief filed in February, HSBC said that if the Supreme Court jettisons Basic’s presumption of reliance on a misrepresentation, a class status review “will be beyond question.” Pfizer is facing a trial later this year over allegations made by shareholders that it fraudulently misrepresented the safety of its Celebrex and Bextra pain-relieving drugs.

593,MRK,CORRECTED-Bayer broadens healthcare line by keeping Merck's consumer brands,"(Corrects fourth paragraph to read “portfolio acquired from Merck”, not “portfolio acquired by Merck”) * Coppertone, Dr. Scholl’s draw interest after $14 bln deal * Bayer says to hold on to non-drug consumer brands By Ludwig Burger and Arno Schuetze FRANKFURT, July 1 (Reuters) - German drugmaker Bayer said it would keep the Dr. Scholl’s and Coppertone brands it bagged as part of a $14 billion buy from U.S. Merck, despite overtures from companies keen to grab them, widening its healthcare line to include consumer goods. Just weeks after clinching the deal to buy Merck ‘s non-prescription drugs business, Bayer - best known as a life sciences company which makes cancer drugs - is being courted by rivals keen to acquire the foot care and sunscreen brands, several people with knowledge of the approaches told Reuters. But when asked about the expressions of interest for Dr. Scholl’s and Coppertone - each worth more than $1 billion - Bayer said it was not planning to untie the Merck bundle it secured in May in a competitive bidding tussle with Reckitt Benckiser, Procter & Gamble Co and Novartis . “We intend to keep the portfolio acquired from Merck & Co. as a core business,” Bayer said in a written statement. The German company, which makes contraceptives as well as prescription drugs against cancer, heart disease and multiple sclerosis, said when it bought the Merck business that its aim was to become global leader in over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. The deal was the largest in the German healthcare sector since Bayer bought rival Schering for 17 billion euros ($24 billion) in 2006. But with Bayer’s existing OTC medicines business listing products like aspirin and Canesten antifungal creams, some are questioning the logic of it wanting to keep everyday products like sunscreen. “They aren’t really part of the core business and don’t have much to do with medicines in the strict sense,” said Warburg Research analyst Ulrich Huwald. Offloading Dr. Scholl’s foot care and Coppertone, which account for 27 percent of the Merck bundle’s combined annual sales, would allow Bayer to focus on Merck’s core healthcare products such as allergy remedy Claritin and MiraLAX laxative, analysts say, and give it the resources to make the most of those brands. Repeated comments by chief executive Marijn Dekkers in the past that Bayer - the inventor of aspirin - is mainly about life sciences and molecular research, seem to have given hope to consumer goods companies that he might yet have wanted to part with brands that have little to do with healthcare. Reckitt Benckiser, which owns the Scholl foot care brand outside the United States, as well as Beiersdorf and L’Oreal were seen as potential acquirers. Officials at the three companies declined to comment. There are however sound reasons for Bayer to retain Coppertone and Dr. Scholl’s despite the products being so different to much of its other business: Big U.S. drug store chains such as Walgreen Co and CVS Caremark  prefer dealing with suppliers that can fill large amounts of shelf space and the two big consumer brands would add to Bayer’s bargaining power. Bayer has also said that the Merck deal, which is expected to close in the second half of the year, should allow it to make better use of its distribution network and sales force and give it more clout when dealing with retailers. There may however be another reason Bayer is reluctant to sell. Having bought Merck’s unit for more than twice the core earnings multiple at which Johnson & Johnson, the world’s largest consumer care company, is trading, any spin-off sales might reveal it to have overpaid. One source said Coppertone and Dr. Scholl’s, with $275 million and $309 million in 2013 sales, respectively, could be worth as much as $4 billion between them, reflecting the sales multiple of about 6.5 that Bayer paid for the entire Merck consumer bundle. But another person said that Dr. Scholl’s was more likely to fetch $1 billion to $1.5 billion, and Coppertone about $1 billion, because personal care products change hands for lower multiples than the medicines included in last month’s deal. Selling on some consumer brands for a lower earnings multiple than what was agreed for the entire Merck portfolio would exposed the high price paid for the remaining OTC drugs - and might not go down well with Bayer investors. “Shareholders would start to do the maths,” the source said.

594,MRK,UPDATE 1-U.S. senators ask Gilead to explain cost of Sovaldi hepatitis drug,"(Adds background on Sovaldi, rival drugs) By Ransdell Pierson July 11 (Reuters) - Two members of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee, including Chairman Ron Wyden, on Friday asked Gilead Sciences Inc to defend the more than $80,000 cost of its breakthrough  treatment for hepatitis C, citing the expense to federal healthcare programs. “Given the impact Sovaldi’s cost will have on Medicare, Medicaid and other federal spending, we need a better understanding of how your company arrived at the price for this drug,” the lawmakers said in a release. “It is unclear how Gilead set the price for Sovaldi.” Sovaldi’s cost can soar to $168,000 in patients that need longer treatment periods, not including the costs of other drugs used with it, the senators said. Gilead acquired Sovaldi (sufosbuvir) in 2012 by paying more than $11 billion for Pharmasset Inc. The deal began to bear fruit after Sovaldi produced stellar results in late-stage clinical trials and was approved by U.S. regulators late last year. The nucleotide analog inhibitor, or “nuke,” blocks a protein needed by the hepatitis C virus to replicate. Other companies, including Merck & Co, are developing their own nukes and other new types of hepatitis C treatments. The criticism from the two senators follows complaints from private healthcare insurers about the price of the most potent new treatment for the dangerous liver disease, which affects more than 3 million Americans. Gilead’s pill, which cures patients more quickly than older drugs, and with fewer side effects, captured $2.3 billion in sales during its first full quarter on the market, a record for the drug industry. The drugmaker has defended the price, saying Sovaldi reduces overall treatment costs for hepatitis C by lowering the number of required healthcare visits and sidestepping the need for other medicines that treat side effects of older therapies. Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, and committee member Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, said in a letter to Gilead Chief Executive Officer John Martin that Sovaldi’s price could also dramatically increase the cost of caring for an estimated 1.8 million prisoners infected with the hepatitis C virus. The senators said Pharmasset, before being acquired by Gilead, had expected to profitably sell the drug in the United States for $36,000, according to Securities and Exchange Commission documents.

596,MRK,Pfizer's need for deal looms larger with earnings report,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc’s vulnerability to cheaper generics and its weak roster of experimental medicines will be on display Tuesday when the company reports quarterly earnings, reviving interest in its pursuit of AstraZeneca Plc or other deals to fortify its pipeline. The largest U.S. drugmaker, whose laboratories have not come up with any big-selling new medicines for a decade, is expected to report significantly lower second-quarter revenue. While many industry watchers expect Pfizer to re-engage with Britain’s AstraZeneca in coming months, some say the U.S. drugmaker should consider targets more focused on biotechnology, a strategy that has paid off for Merck & Co and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.  Although Pfizer is conducting trials of promising products - including breast cancer drug palbociclib and vaccines against meningitis and staph aureus - it needs far more drugs to generate meaningful sales growth, said Ori Hershkovitz, analyst with the Tel Aviv-based Sphera Fund, which holds Pfizer shares.     “Pfizer is in a very desperate spot, having seen most of its pipeline disappoint and facing multiple patent expirations,” he said. “It needs growth; it needs to buy a pipeline.”  Pfizer on May 26 officially abandoned its six-month quest for AstraZeneca after its final $118 billion offer was spurned. Investors still see a rationale for the deal, which would allow Pfizer to enjoy lower corporate tax rates as a UK-based company and a promising pipeline of new cancer treatments. Under British takeover law, AstraZeneca could reach out to Pfizer in August and Pfizer could make renewed overtures to its smaller rival in November. “I definitely think Pfizer will come back for Astra at a somewhat higher bid,” Hershkovitz said. But he recommended Pfizer consider smaller targets whose treatments might broaden  its existing research priorities, such as Belgium’s UCB SA and Switzerland’s Actelion Ltd.  UCB, which makes treatments for epilepsy, rheumatoid arthritis and Parkinson’s disease, has annual sales of $5 billion, and a market value of $17 billion. Actelion sells lucrative drugs for orphan diseases, rare and often life-threatening conditions that command high prices. It has annual sales of $2 billion and a market capitalization of $15 billion.  Leerink Swann analyst Jason Gerberry has said it might make sense for Pfizer to buy Dublin-based generic drugmaker Actavis, which itself just bought U.S. specialty drugmaker Forest Laboratories for $25 billion. Disappointment with Pfizer is reflected in its stock price, which has fallen 1.4 percent this year, against a 11 percent gain for the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index of large U.S. and European drugmakers. Over the past two years, its shares have risen 27 percent, versus a 44 percent jump for the drug sector. A fresh wave of patent expirations on Pfizer’s top drugs is approaching. Its Celebrex painkiller faces generics in the United States late this year, while impotence treatment Viagra goes generic in 2017. The company’s biggest product, Lyrica for nerve pain, loses U.S. patent protection by 2018. The three drugs have combined annual sales of almost $9 billion, and account for almost 20 percent of Pfizer’s total revenue.     Biotechs with drugs already on the market and which also  have exciting technologies should be on Pfizer’s wish list, said Navid Malik, analyst with London-based Cenkos Securities. He cited companies such as Celgene Inc and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. Roger Pomerantz, who headed business development at Merck from 2010 until last summer, said the potential of Merck’s immuno-oncology drugs - medicines which train the immune system to recognize cancer cells - was not recognized even within the company for several years after it acquired them. “It’s who you have on the inside helping you understand the science” that counts, he said.

Although a rally in telecom stocks helped to limit the broader market’s decline, the S&P; 500 ended below its 14-day moving average for a second straight day. Nine of the 10 primary S&P; 500 sectors fell on the day. United Parcel Service shares fell 3.7 percent to $98.86 after the world’s biggest courier company slashed its earnings forecast for the year due to spending to boost capacity. It also reported second-quarter earnings that were below expectations. Rival shipping company FedEx Corp was down 1.6 percent at $147.14. The Dow Jones Transportation index, which is often viewed as a proxy for business activity, fell 1.4 percent. It is about 3 percent away from the record closing high hit last week. UPS is the latest bellwether name whose results have disappointed investors, following Amazon.com Inc and Boeing Co last week. Nonetheless, this earnings season has largely been a positive for equities. With more than half the S&P; 500 having reported already, almost 70 percent have topped earnings expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, well above the long-term average of 63 percent. More than 63 percent have topped revenue forecasts, above the long-term average of 61 percent. “If we started to see more negative outlooks, that would be a reason to pause, but so far this earnings season speaks to the health of corporate America and suggests markets still have room to run,” said David Lebovitz, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds in New York. Telecom stocks were the only sector of the market to rise on Tuesday, adding 2.2 percent after Windstream Holdings  filed to spin off assets into a tax-efficient publicly traded real estate investment trust. The stock jumped 12.3 percent to $11.83 in its busiest trading day on record. Frontier Communications added 14.3 percent to $6.79. After the market closed, Twitter Inc jumped 14.5 percent to $44.20 in extended trading after the social networking company reported second-quarter results, which included revenue that more than doubled. The shares had closed up 1.7 percent in regular NYSE trade ahead of the results. Dow component American Express Co also reported after the market closed; its shares were little changed after the bell. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 70.16 points, or 0.41 percent, to 16,912.43, the S&P; 500 lost 8.93 points, or 0.45 percent, to 1,969.98, and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 2.21 points, or 0.05 percent, to 4,442.70. The Nasdaq’s decline was tempered by biotechnology shares, with the Nasdaq Biotech index up 1.1 percent. Dow components Pfizer and Merck, the No. 1 and No. 2 U.S. drug companies, respectively, reported better-than-expected results. Merck’s new drugs offset declining sales of those facing generic competition. Pfizer was helped by growing sales of its cancer medicines. Merck rose 1.1 percent at $58.58 while Pfizer shed 1.2 percent to $29.73. Corning Inc dropped 9.3 percent to $20 after reporting earnings that came in below estimates as demand fell for its Gorilla Glass, which is used in iPhones and Galaxy devices. Economic data had little impact on the direction of equities. U.S. consumer confidence jumped in July to a high not seen since October 2007, but single-family home prices fell 0.3 percent in May on a seasonally adjusted basis, falling short of expectations. President Barack Obama said the United States was imposing new sanctions on Russia in the energy, arms and finance sectors, following similar moves by the European Union in reaction to Moscow’s support for rebels in eastern Ukraine. About 57 percent of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange closed lower on the day while about 47 percent of Nasdaq-listed shares ended in negative territory.

Windstream Holdings jumped 18.2 percent to $12.45 in its most brisk trading on record after the company filed to spin off assets into a tax-efficient publicly-traded real estate investment trust. The strategy triggered bets on long-term advantages for peers and the S&P; telecoms sector index rose 3.9 percent with AT&T; up 4 percent to $37.09, Verizon  up 2.4 percent at $52.82, CenturyLink up 9.2 percent to $41.18 and Frontier Communications up 18.2 percent to $7.02. The Windstream spinoff’s long reach boosted shares in other network owners and operators, with Comcast and Time Warner Cable up more than 2 percent each, lifting the S&P; consumer discretionary sector 0.6 percent. “The market to some degree has been locked into a range and struggling to find leadership of late, so the movement in telecoms is important in that regard,” said Gordon Charlop, a managing director at Rosenblatt Securities in New York. Dow components Merck and Pfizer reported better-than-expected quarterly results. Merck’s new drugs offset declining sales of ones facing generic competition and Pfizer was helped by growing sales of its cancer medicines.   Merck shares were up 1.5 percent at $58.85 and Pfizer added 0.4 percent to $30.22. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 58.51 points or 0.34 percent, to 17,041.1, the S&P; 500 gained 4.66 points or 0.24 percent, to 1,983.57 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 24.35 points or 0.55 percent, to 4,469.26. U.S. consumer confidence jumped in July to a high not seen since October 2007 but single-family home prices fell 0.3 percent in May on a seasonally adjusted basis, falling short of expectations. “The data has been unremarkable, there’s nothing in there to cause the market to deviate from its current trajectory,” said Charlop. “Unless we have earnings surprises I don’t see anything that will derail the move to the upside.” The Federal Reserve began a two-day meeting on monetary policy. The Fed could make subtle yet telling changes to its policy statement due Wednesday, as it plans how and when to eventually raise interest rates. Weighing on the Dow Jones Transportation Average, shares of UPS fell 3.3 percent to $99.32 after the world’s biggest courier company slashed its earnings forecast for the year due to spending to boost capacity.  The index was down 0.8 percent. Shares of health insurer Aetna fell 2.7 percent to $82.54, even as it reported a higher second-quarter profit helped by last year’s acquisition of Medicare and Medicaid provider Coventry Health Care. Herbalife cut its sales outlook for the year after raising it three months earlier, following billionaire investor Bill Ackman’s latest round of accusations against the company last week.

601,MRK,Merck quarterly profit beats estimates; shares gain,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc reported better-than-expected quarterly results on Tuesday, helped by strong sales of consumer products and medicines for arthritis and HIV, sending its shares up more than 1 percent in morning trading.   Merck, the No. 2 U.S. drugmaker, has been busy with deal-making in recent months, including an agreement to sell its consumer care business to Germany’s Bayer AG for $14.2 billion. In June, it agreed to buy Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc for $3.85 billion and hopes to combine the two companies’ most promising drugs to produce a faster, more effective cure for hepatitis C. Chief Executive Kenneth Frazier, in a conference call with analysts on Tuesday, said Merck was not interested in major acquisitions, but instead favors smaller “bolt-on” deals like the Idenix transaction. Merck is counting on its experimental drugs, including an immuno-oncology drug called pembrolizumab, to help drive revenue and earnings growth in coming years, Frazier said. The company plans to launch pembrolizumab by late October for treatment of melanoma and is testing the drug for cancers of the lung, head and neck and bladder. It plans to introduce insomnia drug Suvorexant, long been delayed by safety concerns, by late 2014 or 2015, if it is approved by regulators. “Merck will likely have another flattish year in 2014 in terms of financial performance but then growth should return more consistently thereafter,” helped by new drugs, Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note. Merck shares were up 1.3 percent at $58.72. The company earned $2.03 billion, or 68 cents per share, in the second quarter. That compares with $906 million, or 30 cents per share, in the year-earlier period, when it took charges for acquisitions and restructuring. Excluding special items, Merck earned 85 cents per share, topping the average 81 cent forecast of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. U.S. rival Pfizer Inc on Tuesday also reported better-than-expected quarterly results. Merck said it expects full-year earnings of $3.43 to $3.53 per share, tightening its earlier forecast of $3.35 to $3.53. The new outlook included expected dilution of up to 9 cents per share from the Bayer and Idenix deals. Global revenue slipped 1 percent to $10.93 billion, but exceeded expectations of $10.6 billion.     Sales of consumer care brands, such as its Miralax laxative and Afrin cold remedy, jumped 19 percent to $583 million. Sales of prescription drugs slipped 2 percent to $9.1 billion, hurt by a 21 percent drop for its Nasonex nasal allergy treatment due to generic competition.     Sales of HIV treatment Isentress rose 10 percent to $453 million, while Remicade arthritis drug sales increased 15 percent to $607 million. Combined sales of Merck’s biggest drugs, diabetes treatments Januvia and Janumet, rose 2 percent to $1.58 billion. Their growth has slowed this year with competition from newer drugs.

607,MRK,U.S. FDA approves Merck insomnia drug,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Wednesday it has approved a new insomnia drug made by Merck & Co. The drug, to be called Belsomra, is the first in a new class of sedatives that block chemicals in the brain called orexins that help keep people awake. Belsomra, known generically as suvorexant, has the potential to cause next-day sleepiness and impaired driving. As a result, the FDA said, no more than one pill should be taken per night and the dose should not exceed 20 milligrams. The FDA had asked Merck to study the next-day driving performance of people who took the drug amid concerns the sedative could lead to next-day drowsiness. The test showed impaired driving in patients who took 20 milligrams of the drug. Patients therefore “should be cautioned against next-day driving or activities requiring full mental alertness,” the FDA said in a statement. Even those who take a lower dose should be made aware of the potential for next-day driving impairment because individuals may respond differently to any given drug, the agency said. The FDA approved the drug in 5, 10, 15 and 20 milligram doses. Merck said it expects the drug to be available in late 2014 or early 2015, once the Drug Enforcement Administration has made its final decision on the scheduling of the drug. The FDA recommended that Belsomra be listed as a controlled substance because it can be addictive and has the potential to be abused. The DEA has proposed that the drug be given a Schedule IV designation. Schedule 1 drugs have the greatest potential for abuse while Schedule V drugs have the least potential. Merck’s shares rose 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday to close at $57.85. Merck had originally proposed that non-elderly adults start on 20 milligrams and increase to 40 milligrams if needed. It recommended that elderly patients start by taking 15 milligrams and increase to 30 if necessary. FDA officials said at an advisory committee meeting in May 2013 that there was little evidence to show the drug was more effective at higher doses and considerable evidence to show it was less safe. “Using the lowest effective dose can reduce the risk of side effects, such as next-morning drowsiness,” said Dr. Ellis Unger, an official in the FDA’s drugs division. Merck said on Wednesday that the recommended dose of Belsomra is 10 milligrams within 30 minutes of going to bed, with at least seven hours before a patient needs to wake up. The drug is designed for people who have difficulty getting to sleep and staying asleep.

610,MRK,Exclusive: U.S. approval of Merck cancer immunotherapy expected soon,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. regulators are likely to approve Merck & Co’s highly anticipated immuno-oncology drug, pembrolizumab, as a treatment for melanoma well ahead of a late October deadline, according to three sources familiar with the situation. If approved by the Food and Drug Administration, the drug would be the first in a promising new class designed to help the body’s own immune system fend off cancer by blocking a protein known as Programmed Death receptor (PD-1), or a related target known as PD-L1, used by tumors to evade disease-fighting cells. Companies including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Roche Holding AG and AstraZeneca Plc are racing to develop similar treatments for a variety of cancers. Some analysts expect the new class could generate more than $30 billion in annual sales worldwide by 2025. The FDA is slated to decide on New Jersey-based Merck’s application no later than October 28, but sources said the agency could give its approval within coming weeks. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the FDA’s plans, also acknowledged that the early approval was not guaranteed. A spokeswoman for the FDA said the agency cannot discuss the status of applications. Merck is first seeking to sell its PD-1 drug for patients whose skin cancer does not respond to treatment with Yervoy, a Bristol-Myers immunotherapy that targets a different part of the immune system. Studies have shown that pembrolizumab shrinks tumors in about a third of patients with late-stage melanoma, a disease that kills around 10,000 Americans each year. “My hope is that over the next five to 10 years, we will be curing over half of melanoma patients,” said Dr Steven O’Day, director of the Los Angeles Skin Cancer Institute. Dr Antoni Ribas, professor of hematology-oncology at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a pembrolizumab trial lead investigator, said having the drug on the market will be “a big deal” for patients who currently have few options. “If we have pembro approved, it makes a big difference. About a third of those patients will have a chance of a durable, long-lasting response,” he said. Merck and its rivals are also studying PD-1 drugs as a treatment for several types of cancer. Lung cancer, which kills nearly 160,000 Americans annually, is seen as the biggest sales opportunity for the new class of treatments. Most current oncology treatments seek to kill cancer cells directly whereas immuno-oncology drugs unleash the body’s own ability to recognize and destroy cancer cells, which medical  researchers say could have broader reach. A potential risk is that stimulating the immune system could cause side effects ranging from mild rash to more serious liver problems or colitis. Bristol hopes to be first to the market with an immunotherapy for lung cancer. It is studying its experimental PD-1 drug, nivolumab, both as a stand-alone therapy and in combination with Yervoy, also known as ipilimumab, which inhibits a protein called CTLA-4.  “We believe a combination of immuno-oncology agents represents the best chance for patients to achieve long-term survival,” said Michael Giordano, head of development, oncology and immunology, at Bristol. He said Bristol is submitting lung cancer data to the FDA on a rolling basis and expects to complete its application by year-end, which “certainly gives us confidence that we are in the lead, potentially first in lung cancer.” Merck is not studying pembrolizumab in combination with its own experimental drugs, but does have studies underway with  drugs from Amgen and others. Merck is also conducting a study of the PD-1 drug in combination with its older melanoma drug Sylatron. “In oncology, combinations typically provide superior  benefit,” Roger Perlmutter, head of research at Merck, said in a June interview. “But picking them is tricky. We first need to understand it as monotherapy.” Perlmutter could not be reached for comment regarding pembrolizumab’s approval timeline. Roche, granted FDA “breakthrough therapy” designation in June for its experimental drug MPDL3280A as a treatment for bladder cancer, is conducting a range of trials in various types of cancer, including combination treatment studies. “We have a broad pipeline of targeted therapies,” said Sandra Horning, chief medical officer at Roche’s Genentech unit.

611,MRK,"RPT-Advaxis, Merck to test immune therapies against prostate cancer","Aug 25 (Reuters) - Advaxis Inc on Monday said it will test an experimental immuno-oncology drug in combination with a high-profile immunotherapy from Merck & Co Inc as a treatment for patients with advanced prostate cancer. The tiny U.S. biotechnology company, in its second cancer collaboration with a large drugmaker in the past month, said it would evaluate the use of its ADXS-PSA as a standalone treatment and also study it in combination with Merck’s pembrolizumab in the Phase I/Phase II trial. Merck’s drug is a member of an exciting new class of medicines called “PD-1 inhibitors” that work by blocking the PD-1 protein, thereby taking the brakes off immune system cells and prodding them to attack tumors. The Advaxis drug consists of a modified form of the Listeria bacterium fused to a protein called PSA that is shed by prostate tumors. It is meant to spur creation of immune system soldiers, called T-cells, that are primed to recognize and kill prostate cancer cells. By using different approaches, the drugmakers hope the two drugs have a better chance of knocking down the prostate cancer than either could achieve on its own. “If the combination of drugs shows an added effect, the companies would likely continue their collaboration,” perhaps under a licensing deal, said Daniel O’Connor, chief executive officer of Advaxis. Prostate cancer is the most common  cancer among men, other than skin cancer.  One man in six will get prostate cancer during his lifetime, and about  3 percent of men die from the disease, according to Advaxis. O’Connor, in an interview, said his company will bear most costs of the study, which is slated to begin in early 2015 and probably be conducted by a contract research organization. Merck will provide the pembrolizumab, an injectable monoclonal antibody, to be used in the trial. PD-1 inhibitors and other immuno-oncology drugs have already shown promise against other types of cancer, including melanoma, but have not yet been tested to any great extent against prostate cancer, according to David Mauro, executive director of oncology at Merck. “We think this combination gives us the opportunity to do early exploration in prostate cancer and bring immuno-oncology into this space,” Mauro said in an interview.

612,MRK,"Advaxis, Merck to test immune therapies against prostate cancer","Aug 25 (Reuters) - Advaxis Inc on Monday said it will test an experimental immuno-oncology drug in combination with a high-profile immunotherapy from Merck & Co Inc as a treatment for patients with advanced prostate cancer. The tiny U.S. biotechnology company, in its second cancer collaboration with a large drugmaker in the past month, said it would evaluate the use of its ADXS-PSA as a standalone treatment and also study it in combination with Merck’s pembrolizumab in the Phase I/Phase II trial. Merck’s drug is a member of an exciting new class of medicines called “PD-1 inhibitors” that work by blocking the PD-1 protein, thereby taking the brakes off immune system cells and prodding them to attack tumors. The Advaxis drug consists of a modified form of the Listeria bacterium fused to a protein called PSA that is shed by prostate tumors. It is meant to spur creation of immune system soldiers, called T-cells, that are primed to recognize and kill prostate cancer cells. By using different approaches, the drugmakers hope the two drugs have a better chance of knocking down the prostate cancer than either could achieve on its own. “If the combination of drugs shows an added effect, the companies would likely continue their collaboration,” perhaps under a licensing deal, said Daniel O’Connor, chief executive officer of Advaxis. Prostate cancer is the most common  cancer among men, other than skin cancer.  One man in six will get prostate cancer during his lifetime, and about  3 percent of men die from the disease, according to Advaxis. O’Connor, in an interview, said his company will bear most costs of the study, which is slated to begin in early 2015 and probably be conducted by a contract research organization. Merck will provide the pembrolizumab, an injectable monoclonal antibody, to be used in the trial. PD-1 inhibitors and other immuno-oncology drugs have already shown promise against other types of cancer, including melanoma, but have not yet been tested to any great extent against prostate cancer, according to David Mauro, executive director of oncology at Merck. “We think this combination gives us the opportunity to do early exploration in prostate cancer and bring immuno-oncology into this space,” Mauro said in an interview. Merck previously announced collaborations with several other drugmakers on combined uses of pembrolizumab with their medicines, including British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer Inc, Amgen Inc and Incyte Corp.

613,MRK,Pfizer to test Xalkori lung cancer drug with Merck immunotherapy,"(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said Tuesday it will test its Xalkori lung cancer drug with Merck & Co’s experimental immunotherapy pembrolizumab, in hopes the combination will improve the outcomes for patients taking the approved Pfizer therapy. The largest U.S. drugmakers said the combination study will begin in 2015 and be conducted by Pfizer. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Xalkori, which has annual sales of $400 million and is also known by its chemical name, crizotinib, was approved in 2011 for lung cancer patients who have a specific mutation in the so-called ALK gene, as determined by an approved diagnostic test. The mutation occurs in a small percentage of patients with non small cell lung cancer, the most common form of lung cancer. It makes them good candidates for treatment with Xalkori, a targeted drug that can help shrink or slow tumor growth for these patients.     Pembrolizumab works by removing the brakes from the immune system, allowing it to detect and destroy cancer cells. The differing mechanisms of action from combination therapy are meant to deliver a one-two punch to cancer cells. The Merck drug, called a PD-1 inhibitor, is expected to be approved within months in the United States and to become a blockbuster treatment for melanoma, and possibly later for lung cancer and other types of cancer, depending on results of ongoing clinical trials.  Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Swiss drugmaker Roche and AstraZeneca Plc are leading the charge in developing PD-1 inhibitors or similar immunotherapies. Some industry analysts believe the medicines will capture combined annual sales of up to $30 billion by 2025. Merck and Pfizer previously said they would collaborate in combination trials of pembrolizumab both with Pfizer’s approved Inlyta (axitinib) treatment for kidney cancer, and with an experimental drug called PF-2566 that Pfizer is evaluating in numerous cancer types. PF-2566 stimulates activity of 4-1BB (CD-137), a protein involved in regulation of immune cell proliferation.  “For Pfizer, these collaborations help secure their drugs in a market that is going under a paradigm shift” toward immunotherapies, said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover. “I see it more of a defensive move to make sure Pfizer’s drugs are being used in the anti-PD-1 space, instead of being bypassed.” Merck is not studying pembrolizumab in combination with its own experimental drugs, but has other combination studies planned or underway with a growing number of drugmakers, including Amgen. Merck is also conducting a study of its PD-1 inhibitor in combination with its own older melanoma drug, Sylatron.

617,MRK,UPDATE 1-S.Korea lifts ban on beef with feed additive -food ministry,"* Decision expected since last October * Review requested by Merck subsidiary * Levels scientifically safe - ministry official   (Adds quotes and details) By Meeyoung Cho SEOUL, Sept 2 (Reuters) - South Korea has lifted a ban on the use of animal feed additive zilpaterol in beef, opening the door to imports containing the growth enhancer as well as domestic sales of the product. Seoul said last October that it intended to ease its zero-tolerance policy on zilpaterol-based drugs, such as Merck & Co Inc’s Zilmax, after a risk assessment fould it could be permitted at certain levels. Many European countries as well as China ban the import of zilpaterol-fed beef due to concerns about side effects of the  additive, which is used to aid growth in the weeks before animals are slaughtered. South Korea last year suspended some U.S. beef imports for more than two months after traces of zilpaterol were found in two shipments. An official at South Korea’s food ministry confirmed on Tuesday that imports of beef muscle with 1 part per billion (ppb) of zilpaterol, 5 ppb in beef liver and 10 ppb in beef kidney had been approved as of late last month. “The approved levels are scientifically safe even if consumers have them for the rest of their lives,” the official told Reuters by phone. “The decision has come after asking farmers via months of public notices.” He noted the approved levels were lower than in other countries, such as the United States, which permits 12 ppb of zilpaterol in beef liver. South Korea delayed the decision to lift the ban for a month earlier this year after a request from China. The reason for the request was not known, the ministry official said on Tuesday. South Korea is a major importer of beef from Australia, the United States and New Zealand. Zilmax was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2006. South Korea’s assessment of its ban was carried out at the request of Merck’s subsidiary MSD Animal Health Korea.

618,MRK,U.S. approves Merck immune-stimulating drug for melanoma,"(Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Thursday approved the use of Merck & Co Inc’s immuno-oncology drug Keytruda, also known as pembrolizumab, as a treatment for patients with advanced melanoma who are no longer responding to other therapies. The decision marks the first U.S. approval for a promising new class designed to help the body’s own immune system fend off cancer by blocking a protein known as Programmed Death receptor (PD-1), or a related target known as PD-L1, used by tumors to evade disease-fighting cells. For Tom Stutz, a 74-year-old retired lawyer living in Southern California, the Merck drug has meant a new lease on life. “I was really ready to mail it in,” before entering a pembrolizumab trial in April 2012 after melanoma had spread to his lungs, liver and back, he said. Stutz, who still receives an infusion of the drug every three weeks, said he has “gone from not being able to turn over in bed, to being able to play tennis three days a week, and ride a bike 25 miles a day.” He said side effects amounted to some itching. “This is not a drug that attacks the cancer directly. It enables the immune system to do the job that it is capable of doing,” said Dr. Louis Weiner, director of the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center at Georgetown University. “This is the first beachhead that’s been taken. It’s going to be all out assault on many different types of cancer.” Merck and others, including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Roche Holding AG and AstraZeneca Plc, are racing to develop PD-1 pathway drugs as treatments for a variety of cancers, including lung cancer. Some analysts expect the new class could generate more than $30 billion in annual sales worldwide by 2025. Melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, kills around 10,000 Americans each year, according to the National Cancer Institute. The FDA said clinical trials of Keytruda showed that it shrank tumors in around 24 percent of patients with advanced melanoma whose disease worsened after prior treatment. The agency had designated the drug a “breakthrough therapy,” and approved it nearly two months ahead of an Oct. 28 decision deadline. Reuters reported exclusively last week that the approval was likely to come far earlier than the deadline [L1N0R52D3]. Keytruda is the sixth new melanoma drug approved by the FDA since 2011. “This is a patient population with few options ... We are highly encouraged by the response rate and the duration of response,” said Dr Rick Pazdur, director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology in the FDA’s drug evaluation center. “The true benefit of these drugs may be in patients who do not have metastatic disease, but are at risk of recurrence.” Merck said one of its first priorities was to see whether the drug is effective in patients with earlier-stage cancer. Keytruda will be priced at about $12,500 per month, which “is consistent with other innovative oncology medicines,” Merck said. For patients with advanced melanoma, the median duration of treatment has been 6.2 months. Common side effects of Keytruda seen during clinical trials included fatigue, cough, nausea, itchy skin, rash and diarrhea. Because it stimulates the immune system, Keytruda has the potential for severe immune-mediated side effects, including liver problems and colitis. Merck is studying the drug in more than 30 different types of tumors, said Roger Perlmutter, head of research at the pharmaceutical company. Merck expects to present data from studies in lung, bladder and gastric cancers at a European medical meeting later this month. Perlmutter said Merck’s next FDA filing for Keytruda will depend on which trials “yield the most powerful results.” Bristol expects to complete by the end of this year a “rolling” submission for FDA approval of its drug, Opdivo, or nivolumab, for certain patients with late-stage lung cancer. The company also plans to file an FDA application by the end of this month for use of the drug, which is approved in Japan, for patients with advanced melanoma.

624,MRK,"Merck osteoporosis drug passes trial, but side effects hover","(Reuters) - Merck & Co said it will seek U.S. approval next year for its long-delayed experimental osteoporosis drug, odanacatib, after it proved effective in a late-stage trial but was associated with rare thigh-bone fractures seen with standard treatments.  The once-weekly pill, deemed a potential blockbuster product by some industry analysts, significantly reduced risk of fractures of the hip and spine, and of non-vertebral fractures, compared with placebo, Merck said on Monday. The trial, called LOFT, involved almost 17,000 women, 65 years or older, who had been diagnosed with the bone-thinning disease that primarily affects postmenopausal women. Although the overall rate of side effects was similar in the two patient groups, those taking odanacatib had slightly higher incidence of death and atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat that can cause stroke. There were similar numbers of cardiovascular events in both patient groups, although a numerically higher incidence of strokes in the odanacatib group was not deemed statistically significant. Five patients taking odanacatib developed atypical fractures of the thigh-bone, compared with none in the placebo group. Similar rare femur fractures have been among the most worrisome side effects of the leading class of treatments, called bisphosphonates, which include Merck’s own Fosamax and generic forms of it sold by others. Keith Kaufman, a senior Merck research official, said all patients who developed the thigh fractures had encountered some form of trauma and had severe osteoporosis. By contrast, he said many such fractures associated with bisphosphonates have been “spontaneous.”     Kaufman noted that certain skin lesions occurred more often in patients taking odanacatib, than those in the placebo group, but said the condition went away or moderated after treatment was stopped. “The safety profile (of odanacatib) has some red flags” which could create concern among regulators, BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said in a research note. Even so, he said odanacatib’s benefits appear to outweigh its risks. Arfaei predicted the drug will be approved by early 2016 and have sales of $536 million in 2020.

625,MRK,"UPDATE 2-Merck osteoporosis drug passes trial, but side effects hover","(Adds Merck comment, details on side effects, effectiveness) By Ransdell Pierson Sept 15 (Reuters) - Merck & Co said it will seek U.S. approval next year for its long-delayed experimental osteoporosis drug, odanacatib, after it proved effective in a late-stage trial but was associated with rare thigh-bone fractures seen with standard treatments. The once-weekly pill, deemed a potential blockbuster product by some industry analysts, significantly reduced risk of fractures of the hip and spine, and of non-vertebral fractures, compared with placebo, Merck said on Monday. The trial, called LOFT, involved almost 17,000 women, 65 years or older, who had been diagnosed with the bone-thinning disease that primarily affects postmenopausal women. Although the overall rate of side effects was similar in the two patient groups, those taking odanacatib had slightly higher incidence of death and atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat that can cause stroke. There were similar numbers of cardiovascular events in both patient groups, although a numerically higher incidence of strokes in the odanacatib group was not deemed statistically significant. Five patients taking odanacatib developed atypical fractures of the thigh-bone, compared with none in the placebo group. Similar rare femur fractures have been among the most worrisome side effects of the leading class of treatments, called bisphosphonates, which include Merck’s own Fosamax and generic forms of it sold by others. Keith Kaufman, a senior Merck research official, said all patients who developed the thigh fractures had encountered some form of trauma and had severe osteoporosis. By contrast, he said many such fractures associated with bisphosphonates have been “spontaneous.” Kaufman noted that certain skin lesions occurred more often in patients taking odanacatib, than those in the placebo group, but said the condition went away or moderated after treatment was stopped. “The safety profile (of odanacatib) has some red flags” which could create concern among regulators, BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said in a research note. Even so, he said odanacatib’s benefits appear to outweigh its risks. Arfaei predicted the drug will be approved by early 2016 and have sales of $536 million in 2020. In a late-stage trial whose results were described in 2012, odanacatib demonstrated effectiveness in preventing fractures, boosting Wall Street hopes that the new type of osteoporosis treatment would be approved and eventually generate annual sales of up to $2 billion.

630,MRK,Germany's Merck to buy Sigma-Aldrich for $17 billion to boost lab supplies operation,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Drugs and chemicals maker Merck KGaA (MRCG.DE) agreed on Monday to acquire U.S.-based Sigma-Aldrich Corp SIAL.O for $17 billion in cash to boost its lab supplies business, the biggest takeover in the German group’s history. The deal helps Merck, 70 percent controlled by the descendants of its 17th century founder, to focus more on supplying drugmakers and academic institutions with chemicals and services, seen as offering a steadier income stream than drug development. “With this acquisition we have the opportunity to turn one of our most reliable businesses into a core earnings contributor,” said finance chief Marcus Kuhnert. Merck, which has been hit by several drug development failures, said it was happy for its own pharmaceuticals business to remain a medium-sized entity. The deal was approved by Sigma-Aldrich’s management but still needs acceptance from more than 50 percent of the target’s shareholders.  Merck said it will acquire Sigma-Aldrich shares for $140 apiece, a 36 percent premium over the one-month average closing price and a 37 percent more than the latest closing price of $102.37 on Friday, Sept. 19. St Louis, Missouri-based Sigma had 2013 sales of $2.7 billion and provides big pharma groups including Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Novartis AG NOVN.VS with lab substances such as cell culture substrates. It also makes chemicals for the technology sector and food testing products. The combined lab supplies business would gain more exposure in North America and Asia, taking on global players such as Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc (TMO.N). The deal would immediately top-up adjusted earnings per share. The move comes as healthcare companies strike deals at a record pace, with year-to-date activity in the sector topping $380 billion, well over double the year-ago level, according to Thomson Reuters data. It represents the second major transatlantic deal for a German company in the space of a few hours, after Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE) agreed to buy oilfield equipment maker Dresser-Rand Group Inc DRC.N for $7.6 billion.  Shares in Merck, which initially turned negative on the news, closed 4.3 percent higher at 72.63 euros, against a 0.2 percent lower European chemicals index .SX4P. Merck expects the tie-up, funded from about 2 billion euros in cash reserves and the issue of new debt, to yield annual synergy benefits of 260 million euros ($334 million) within three years after closing, by measures such as streamlining manufacturing, administration and research. It said it was too early to say if any jobs would be cut. The deal would more than double the lab equipment unit’s adjusted core earnings, even without such synergy gains; including them, the increase would be 139 percent, based on proforma 2013 results. “The fact that (the Merck family) are not taking a big step further into pharma shows that continuous returns on their investment over time are certainly important to the family,” said analyst Ulrich Huwald at brokerage Warburg. At about 6 billion euros in annual sales, Merck’s pharmaceuticals unit is well outside the global top 20, having suffered a series of drug development setbacks such as with an experimental cancer vaccine known as tecemotide, or Stimuvax, which did not come to market due to poor study results.  The group said on Monday that alliances, not major takeovers, would be the way forward for the unit. “The pharmaceuticals business (will) remain a good and solid mid-sized player”, Kley said. Merck had earlier this year signaled that big pharma assets were on its radar and some analysts took a positive view on the fact it had steered clear of such moves.  Citi analyst Andrew Baum said in a note the acquisition came at a steep premium of about 30 times Sigma’s expected 2015 earnings per share, but argued the deal was better than buying a biotech or pharmaceutical asset given what he said was Merck’s “long-standing poor track record in pharmaceutical R&D;”.  Merck, the largest maker of liquid crystals for TV and computer screens, made lab supplies a major pillar of its business when it purchased U.S. group Millipore for $6 billion in 2010. Combining with Sigma would make it one of the global market’s top three, the group said. Merck’s biggest deal before this one was the takeover of Swiss biotech company Serono for 10.3 billion euros. Initial bridge loans to finance the deal will be replaced by about 4 billion euros in bank loans and 7 billion euros in bonds. Merck said strong combined cash flows would allow for rapid deleveraging. Guggenheim Securities and JP Morgan advised Merck on the deal, together with law firm Skadden, while Morgan Stanley acted as financial adviser to Sigma-Aldrich, with Sidley Austin as legal adviser.

631,MRK,Merck drug extends immune system fight to stomach cancer,"MADRID (Reuters) - Merck & Co’s drug Keytruda, the first in a new wave of immune-boosting medicines to be approved for treating melanomas  in the United States, also has potential in stomach cancer, new research shows. Early clinical trial results reported on Sunday mean that gastric, or stomach cancer can be added to a growing list of tumor types where so-called immunotherapy may have an important role to play. Keytruda belongs to a drug class designed to help the body’s own immune system fend off cancer by blocking a protein known as Programed Death receptor (PD-1), or a related target PD-L1, used by tumors to evade disease-fighting cells. On Sept. 4 it became the first drug of this type to win U.S. approval, although rivals including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Roche and AstraZeneca are working on similar products. While developed first for melanoma, these medicines are also showing promise in a range of other tumor types, including kidney, lung, bladder, and head and neck cancer. In a small Phase I study involving 39 patients with PD-L1 positive, advanced stomach cancer, a total of 12 people - or 31 percent - saw their tumors shrink after being given Keytruda, Kei Muro of Japan’s Aichi Cancer Center Hospital told the European Society of Medical Oncology annual congress. Importantly, overall response rates were similar in Asian patients — a population with a high rate of stomach cancer — and non-Asian patients, Muro said. The Phase I clinical trial is continuing but at the time of analysis the duration of responses in individual patients ranged from more than eight weeks to more than 20 weeks.  Merck said it planned to start a larger Phase II study in the first quarter of 2015 on the back of the encouraging data. Common adverse side effects included thyroid problems and fatigue, while serious grade 3-5 adverse events occurred in three patients. There was one treatment-related death. Immunotherapy is dominating the meeting of oncologists in Madrid as excitement builds about an approach that promises to push many cancer patients into remission by unleashing the power of their own immune systems to fight tumors. Further data on Merck’s drug as a treatment for bladder cancer is also due to be released on Monday in Madrid.  Some analysts believe the new immunotherapy drug class could generate more than $30 billion in annual sales worldwide by 2025 - a figure that reflects both the wide range of patients who could benefit and the high price of the medicines. The U.S. price for Keytruda is around $12,500 per month in melanoma patients, for whom the median duration of treatment has been 6.2 months.

633,MRK,Merck immunotherapy drug shows promise in bladder cancer,"MADRID (Reuters) - Merck & Co’s new immune system drug Keytruda has produced encouraging results in early tests against bladder cancer, according to a company-sponsored study, prompting the firm to prepare a clinical trial later this year. Keytruda is the first in a new wave of immune-boosting medicines to be approved for treating melanomas in the United States, but it also has potential in a range of other cancers.  Bladder cancer is seen as a disease that is likely to be amenable to such drugs, which are designed to help the body’s own immune system fend off cancer by blocking a protein known as Programmed Death receptor (PD-1), or a related target PD-L1. Roche has a similar experimental drug that is currently in the lead in addressing the specific indication of bladder cancer.  In Merck’s study involving 29 people with PD-L1 positive, advanced bladder cancer, seven patients — or 24 percent — saw their tumors shrink after being given Keytruda, Elizabeth Plimack of Philadelphia’s Fox Chase Cancer Center told the European Society of Medical Oncology on Monday. Based on this data, Merck said it would initiate a pivotal Phase III study this year to further explore the use of Keytruda in advanced bladder cancer.

635,MRK,UPDATE 1-Esperion drug succeeds in lowering LDL cholesterol -study,"(Adds share move, analyst forecast) By Bill Berkrot Oct 1 (Reuters) - An experimental cholesterol-fighting drug being developed by Esperion Therapeutics Inc lowered LDL levels significantly more than Merck & Co Inc’s  Zetia in a midstage clinical trial, Esperion said on Wednesday. Esperion shares rose more than 40 percent in after-hours trade. In a 12-week study involving 348 patients with high LDL cholesterol, the Esperion drug, ETC-1002, led to an average 30 percent reduction in levels of the “bad” cholesterol for those who received a 180 milligram dose and a 27 percent reduction with a 120 mg dose, according to initial results. Both were deemed to be statistically significant differences compared with reductions in patients taking Zetia, known chemically as ezetimibe, Esperion said. The LDL reductions seen with the once-daily ETC-1002 pill were somewhat less than can be achieved by more powerful statins, such as Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor, now available as generic atorvastatin, and AstraZeneca Plc’s Crestor. The reductions were roughly half of the LDL-lowering magnitude seen with new injectable biotech cholesterol drugs, called PCSK9 inhibitors, likely to be approved next year. The Esperion drug, when combined with 10 mg of Zetia, led to LDL reductions of 48 percent for the high dose of ETC-1002 and 43 percent with the lower dose. “These are very encouraging results. It basically shows efficacy, and it shows that it can be added to ezetimibe to get more efficacy,” Dr. Christie Ballantyne, chief of cardiology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and one of the study’s investigators, said in a telephone interview. “Statins are going to stay first-line drugs,” he said. “There’s lots of people who have a hard time taking a high dose of statin or taking a statin at all.” Esperion is also conducting trials combining its drug with various statins. If approved, the Esperion drug is almost surely going to be less expensive than the more effective biologics, making it a potential option that physicians could reach for before putting patients on the injectables, Ballantyne said. JMP Securities analyst Jason Butler has forecast annual peak sales in excess of $1 billion for the medicine. ETC-1002 also led to significantly greater reductions than Zetia in C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation associated with heart disease, the company said. ETC-1002 is the first in a new class of drugs called ACL inhibitors that work by reducing cholesterol synthesis in the liver and increasing expression of LDL receptors that remove cholesterol from the blood. The most common side effects were common cold symptoms and upper respiratory tract infections. The rates of muscle-related adverse side effects seen with ETC-1002 patients, including those with statin intolerance, were similar to rates for Zetia, Esperion said. Esperion shares rose to $35 in extended trading from a Nasdaq close at $24.42.

640,MRK,Fitch Rates Merck's EUR Debt Offering 'A+'; Outlook Negative,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 06 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+' rating Merck &  Co.'s (Merck) Euro denominated senior unsecured notes offering. Merck intends to  use all or a substantial portion of the net proceeds from the offering to  refinance existing debt. The Rating Outlook is Negative and applies to approximately $23.1 billion in  outstanding debt. A full list of Merck's ratings follows near the end of this  release. KEY RATING DRIVERS --The Negative Outlook mainly reflects that leverage (total debt/EBITDA) has  remained above 1.5 times (x) since Merck's $5 billion, largely debt-funded share  repurchases in second-quarter 2013 (2Q'13). While leverage has declined to 1.52x  from its peak of 1.92x at June 30, 2013, the Oct. 1, 2014 sale of its consumer  business to Bayer will modestly weigh on EBITDA and leverage.  --Fitch expects that Merck will continue to favor share repurchases over  deleveraging, acknowledging the possibility of further debt-funded stock  buybacks. Notably, the company has roughly $7 billion remaining on its existing  repurchase authorization. --Sales at-risk to patent expiries have declined to roughly 20% of total firm  sales. Roughly one-third of those sales are generated by biologics, which tend  to have significantly less market share erosion in the face of generic  (biosimilar) than do traditional small molecule drugs. --Merck has made progress in building its late-stage pipeline. The company has  approximately 20 new molecular entities (NMEs) in phase 3 development or  registration. --Merck initiated a restructuring program in October 2013, which Fitch expects  will be supportive to margins during the intermediate term. Merck will focus on  costs in a number of areas including manufacturing, general administration and  research & development. --Fitch believes the sale of Merck's consumer business was strategically sound,  as it increasec the company's focus on its core mission of developing and  marketing innovative medicines. However, the sale incrementall decreases the  diversification of the company's business model. --Fitch expects modest growth for Merck's Januvia/Janumet franchise, as the  market becomes increasingly crowded with new entrants. Although, the growth in  the number of diabetic patients and some share gains from older generic  treatment modalities should offset the competitive headwinds. --Fitch forecasts that Merck will generate $5.8 billion - $6.1 billion in FCF  during 2014 as improving margins offset soft revenue. Debt Financed Share Repurchases Fitch expects that Merck will continue with shareholder friendly actions during  the near term, some of which may be funded by debt. Merck purchased $2.3 billion  (net of issuances) of its common stock during the first six months of 2014. The  repurchases were executed under a $15 billion program authorized in May 2013 and  a previously authorized program. Merck has approximately $7 billion remaining  under the May 2013 share repurchase program.  Patent Exposure Easing Merck faces significant number of patent expiries during the next two years.  However, roughly only 20% of total firm sales are at risk. In addition, Remicade  and PEG-Intron (accounting for about 6.2% of total firm) are biologics and tend  not to experience the rapid sales loss to generic competition as do traditiona,  one small molecule pharmaceuticals. Expanding Late Stage Pipeline Fitch expects Merck to continue to build its late-stage pipeline, despite the  company's intention to narrow its focus its focus on R&D; projects. Merck's late  stage pipeline is broad with new molecular entities (NMEs) to treat cancer,  bacterial and viral infections, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, central  nervous system disorders, osteoporosis, allergies and other maladies. The  September 2014 FDA approval of Keytruda was a significant milestone in Merck's  development of cancer treatments. While the majority of these projects are internally developed, Merck has  partnered with other innovator firms to take advantage of technological  advancements that were discovered externally. The landscape for drug development  is expanding, particularly as more is learned about how genetics influence the  development, prevention and treatment of disease.  Cost Cutting Continues In October 2013, Merck initiated a new global restructuring program, in an  effort to sharpen its global commercial and research & development focus. Merck  is working on reducing costs in the areas of sales, administration and research  & development. Merck continues to work towards improving the efficiency of its  manufacturing and supply network. The restructuring program is expected to be  substantially completed by the end of 2015. Estimated pre-tax restructuring  costs are approximately $2.5 billion - $3 billion, of which two-thirds will be  cash-related. Consumer Business Sale  Fitch believes the sale of Merck's consumer products business is a modest  negative for its credit profile, with the expectation that the proceeds of the  sales would not be used for debt reduction. While the consumer business  accounted for roughly 4% of total firm sales, Fitch estimates the segment's  contribution to Merck's total EBITDA is less than that. Regardless, Fitch  believes the negative effects of an incrementally less diversified product  portfolio and a lower base of profitability will more than offset the benefits  to the firm from increasing its focus on its core competency of drug development  and marketing in the near term. More Competition for Januvia/Janumet Fitch expects that the growing number of diabetic patients and continued market  share gains from some older generic diabetes treatments will more than offset  the increasing number of competitors in the diabetes treatment market. This will  result in relatively soft sales growth for Januvia/Janumet, Merck's largest  selling franchise. Growth has slowed in recent years due to competition (DPP-4  inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists) entering the diabetes market. In  addition, concerns over the safety of these drugs(DPP-4 inhibitors) have been a  headwind to growth. However, the FDA recently reaffirmed their safety regarding  pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer.  Solid Free Cash Flow Expected Fitch forecasts that Merck will continue to generate significantly positive free  cash flow generate, including expected 2014 FCF of $5.8 billion - $6.1 in FCF  during 2014. Improving margins driven by an improving sales mix and strong cost  control should more than offset the negative effect that expected soft top-line  growth will have on cash generation. Adequate Liquidity Fitch looks for Merck to maintain adequate liquidity through strong FCF  generation and ample access to the credit markets. FCF for the LTM ending June  30, 2014 was $5.1 billion. At the end of the period, Merck had approximately  $13.4 billion in cash plus short-term investments and full availability on its  $4 billion revolver, maturing in May 2017.  At June 30, 2014, Merck had roughly $24.1 billion in debt outstanding. Fitch  expects near- to mid-term maturities will be satisfied primarily through  refinancing in the public debt markets. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch would consider revising the Rating Outlook to Stable if Merck pursued a  capital deployment strategy that maintained gross debt leverage below 1.5X  during the long term, including managing through operational stress such as  patent expiries and clearly taking a more conservative approach to its use of  debt. In addition, Merck must demonstrate long-term positive sales growth  through demand for core drug products and uptake of new medicines.  Rating pressure would stem from total debt leverage remaining above 1.5x in the  intermediate term. The high leverage would likely be driven by incremental  borrowing to fund acquisitions or share repurchases. Leverage pressure could  also result from operational weakness due to an inability to achieve in  achieving cost containment targets or generating sales growth despite is  improving patent risk profile and expanding late-stage pipeline. In addition,  Fitch anticipatates that FCF would be constrained in this scenario. Fitch currently rates Merck as follows:   --Long-term IDR 'A+';  --Senior unsecured debt rating 'A+'; --Bank loan rating 'A+'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'; --Commercial paper rating 'F1'. The Rating Outlook on the long-term ratings is Negative.

642,MRK,Geographic split likely for GSK mature drugs sale -sources,"LONDON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline is seeking binding bids by next month for a range of older drugs worth more than $3 billion, which it is likely to sell by geographical region, according to people with direct knowledge of the process. Potential bidders include private equity firm KKR, India’s Lupin and Denmark’s Lundbeck, all of which are interested in acquiring rights to products in certain regions. Britain’s biggest drug maker is looking to divest the mature products in a bid to improve its growth profile and wants to dispose of off-patent drugs marketed in North America and western Europe. The medicines on the block, known as established products, are expected to have combined 2014 sales of around 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion), although their sales are declining due to competition from cheap generic drugs. The sources said GSK was looking for a multiple of more than two times sales, suggesting a price of at least $3.2 billion. GSK, which is being advised by Lazard, aims to find buyers by the end of the year and is keen to maximise returns for shareholders, whether that means selling the products as a single unit or splitting them up by region, they added. Danish pharmaceutical company Lundbeck is reviewing a bid for products marketed in North America as it seeks to expand there, two of the sources said. KKR has teamed up with private Netherlands-based gastrointestinal specialist Norgine in a bid to acquire some of GSK’s drugs sold in Europe, said the same people. Indian generics firm Lupin is also expected to participate in the second round of the auction and would be interested in products in the United States, said the sources. Other private equity funds with an interest in healthcare are also looking at some specific products. Some bidders might still emerge with an interest in the entire portfolio, although this scenario is seen as less likely. Acquiring GSK’s older drugs would be more complicated for private equity funds than other drug manufacturers as GSK is not planning to sell the factories, which means the funds would need to outsource manufacturing and distribution operations. GSK, Lundbeck, KKR and Norgine all declined to comment. Lupin, meanwhile, has said for some months it wants to enhance its U.S. branded generics business and a company official previously confirmed to Reuters it was looking for deals, while declining comment on specific targets. GSK Chief Executive Andrew Witty said in July that there had been significant interest from both mid-sized pharmaceutical companies and buyout specialists in the assets now on the block. The GSK brands up for sale include antidepressant Paxil, migraine treatment Imitrex, Zantac for stomach acid and Zofran for nausea. The company intends to retain the rights to such products in emerging markets, where they are still growing. Ditching mature products sold in Western markets makes long-term sense, since sales are declining. However, these items remain very profitable, so a sale may dilute earnings per share, which could further strain GSK’s already stretched dividend cover. Sales of all GSK’s established products - including those being retained - totalled 1.51 billion pounds in the first half of 2014, down 18 percent on a year earlier. GSK’s decision to carve out some of its mature drug portfolio is part of a wider industry trend, with Mylan  agreeing in July to buy Abbott Laboratories’ branded specialty and generics business in non-U.S. developed markets. Other companies including Sanofi and Merck & Co  are also looking at similar divestments.

643,MRK,Merck unit to pay $31 million to settle fraud claims by U.S. states,"(Reuters) - A subsidiary of Merck & Co has agreed to pay U.S. states $31 million to settle claims that it overcharged their Medicaid programs for an antidepressant it had sold at a discount to pharmacy companies, attorney generals from three states said on  Wednesday.

645,MRK,"Roche, Merck extend immunotherapy fight to breast cancer","LONDON (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Roche and U.S. group Merck & Co are to present data on their rival immunotherapy drugs in breast cancer in December, extending the novel approach to fighting tumors to another cancer type. Early clinical results with Roche’s drug, known as MPDL3280A, in so-called triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) will be revealed at the Dec. 9-13 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, the firm said after announcing third-quarter results. TNBC does not respond to either of two kinds of hormonal therapy or drugs that target HER2 receptors, such as Roche’s own Herceptin. Merck later confirmed that it, too, would present data on TNBC with its competitor drug Keytruda at the same breast cancer meeting. Both drugs belong to a class designed to help the body’s own immune system fend off cancer by blocking a protein known as Programmed Death receptor (PD-1), or a related target PD-L1, used by tumors to evade disease-fighting cells. Developed first for melanoma, these medicines are also showing promise in a range of other tumor types.  Roche’s MPDL3280A, which is not yet approved for any type of cancer, is already being tested in melanoma, as well as lung, bladder, kidney, bowel and blood cancers. Merck’s Keytruda became the first in the new wave of immune-boosting medicines to be approved for treating melanoma in the United States last month and is also being tested in a range of other tumor types. Some analysts believe the new immunotherapy drug class could generate more than $30 billion (18.66 billion pounds) in annual sales for the industry as a whole by 2025, reflecting both the wide range of patients who could benefit and the high cost of the medicines. The two other main rivals in the space are Bristol-Myers Squibb and AstraZeneca.

648,MRK,Ex-Bank of New York Mellon employee pleads guilty to insider trading,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) employee on Friday pleaded guilty to insider trading based on tips from a former Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) employee about potential pharmaceutical mergers. Federal prosecutors in New York said David Post, 41, a product manager at the bank, received nonpublic information from a former Rutgers Business School classmate about three companies: Idenix Pharmaceuticals, Ardea BioSciences and ViroPharma Inc [VIRO.UL]. Prosecutors did not name the classmate, but on Oct. 14 they charged Zachary Zwerko, a former senior finance analyst with Merck, with passing inside tips about the same three stocks to a Rutgers classmate who worked at a bank. The connection was confirmed when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday amended a parallel civil complaint against Zwerko to include Post as a defendant. Ron Gruendl, a spokesman for Bank of New York Mellon, said Post’s conduct was not connected to his work at the bank. “We have cooperated fully with law enforcement and regulatory agencies,” he said. “He is no longer employed here.” According to criminal and civil court filings, Zwerko passed information to Post about Merck’s acquisition of Idenix as well as Ardea and ViroPharma, which Zwerko learned were potential acquisition targets. Post then traded on the information and split the profits with Zwerko, authorities said. AstraZeneca PLC (AZN.L) announced a bid for Ardea in April 2012, while Shire PLC (SHP.L) announced a takeover of ViroPharma in November 2013. “Post and Zwerko tried to keep law enforcement authorities in the dark by using prepaid cell phones and a dummy e-mail account to communicate inside information, and Post doled out the kickbacks inside his own home,” Sanjay Wadhwa, senior associate director of the SEC’s New York regional office, said in a statement. At a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein, a tearful Post admitted he executed a series of trades between 2012 and 2014 based on the tips. He entered a guilty plea to one count of conspiracy and three counts of securities fraud as part of a cooperation agreement with the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s office. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jessica Masella said in court that Post is believed to have earned more than $700,000 in illicit profits. Post, a resident of Livingston, New Jersey, is scheduled to be sentenced in January and faces up to 20 years in prison on each securities fraud count and up to 5 years on the conspiracy charge, although a maximum sentence is unlikely.

Ron Gruendl, a spokesman for Bank of New York Mellon, said Post’s conduct was not connected to his work at the bank. “We have cooperated fully with law enforcement and regulatory agencies,” he said. “He is no longer employed here.” According to criminal and civil court filings, Zwerko passed information to Post about Merck’s acquisition of Idenix as well as Ardea and ViroPharma, which Zwerko learned were potential acquisition targets. Post then traded on the information and split the profits with Zwerko, authorities said. AstraZeneca PLC announced a bid for Ardea in April 2012, while Shire PLC announced a takeover of ViroPharma in November 2013. “Post and Zwerko tried to keep law enforcement authorities in the dark by using prepaid cell phones and a dummy e-mail account to communicate inside information, and Post doled out the kickbacks inside his own home,” Sanjay Wadhwa, senior associate director of the SEC’s New York regional office, said in a statement. At a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein, a tearful Post admitted he executed a series of trades between 2012 and 2014 based on the tips. He entered a guilty plea to one count of conspiracy and three counts of securities fraud as part of a cooperation agreement with the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s office. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jessica Masella said in court that Post is believed to have earned more than $700,000 in illicit profits. Post, a resident of Livingston, New Jersey, is scheduled to be sentenced in January and faces up to 20 years in prison on each securities fraud count and up to 5 years on the conspiracy charge, although a maximum sentence is unlikely.

651,MRK,Wall St. flat after last week's big gain; energy weighs,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended near flat on Monday, pausing after the S&P; 500’s biggest weekly gain since January 2013, while energy shares fell with another decline in oil prices. Among the day’s biggest positives, shares of Gilead Sciences (GILD.O) rose 1.7 percent to $112.59, a day ahead of its scheduled earnings release. Micron Technology (MU.O) shares jumped 4 percent to $32.30 and was the largest percentage gainer on both the S&P; 500 and Nasdaq 100 after it announced a $1 billion stock repurchase. But energy shares were by far the day’s biggest drag, with the S&P; 500 energy index .SPNY falling 2 percent. U.S. crude oil CLc1 briefly traded below $80 a barrel after Goldman Sachs slashed its crude price forecasts, citing abundant supply and lackluster demand. The S&P; 500 ended the day down slightly after closing out its best week since early January 2013, a sharp recovery from the market’s recent selloff. The index is now up 5.3 percent from its Oct. 15 low. “After almost a 10 percent correction on the S&P;, the bulls showed up and sent the prices right back up. Now... we’re on track for closing in the upper half of the range for the month, which is a bullish sign,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York. Accommodative central bank policies globally should keep “an underlying bid for stocks,” he said. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 12.53 points, or 0.07 percent, to 16,817.94, the S&P; 500 .SPX lost 2.95 points, or 0.15 percent, to 1,961.63 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 2.22 points, or 0.05 percent, to 4,485.93.   The majority of companies are beating earnings expectations. With results in from 213 of the S&P; 500 companies, 71.4 percent beat analysts’ forecasts, which would be highest percentage since the third quarter of 2011, Thomson Reuters data showed.  U.S.-traded shares of Brazilian companies tumbled after President Dilma Rousseff won reelection, defeating market favorite Aecio Neves by a slim margin.  Petrobras ADRs (PBR.N) slumped 13.7 percent to $11.16 and Vale (VALE.N) lost 5.2 percent to $10.58. A Brazilian exchange-traded fund (EWZ.P) dropped 5.4 percent.  After the bell, shares of Twitter (TWTR.N) dropped 9.6 percent to $43.88 after it reported quarterly revenue that surpassed expectations but forecast fourth-quarter sales that may miss targets.  On the S&P; 500, the largest decliner was Nabors Industries (NBR.N), down 6.7 percent to $17.48. On the Nasdaq, the largest decliner was Tesla Motors (TSLA.O), down 5.8 percent at $221.67. Declining NYSE issues outnumbered advancers 1,737 to 1,308, for a 1.33-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,424 issues fell and 1,235 advanced for a 1.15-to-1 ratio. The benchmark S&P; 500 index posted 53 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 45 new highs and 62 new lows.

652,MRK,Weak Merck sales overshadow third-quarter cost cuts,"(Reuters) - Cost cuts enabled Merck & Co to beat third-quarter earnings forecasts but disappointing sales of its Gardasil cervical cancer vaccine and other big products sent its shares about 2 percent lower. Merck said on Monday it earned $895 million, or 31 cents per share, in the quarter. That compared with $1.12 billion, or 38 cents per share, in the year-earlier period.  Excluding special items, Merck earned 90 cents per share, topping the average analyst forecast of 88 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Company sales fell 4 percent to $10.56 billion, below Wall Street expectations of $10.67 billion. Gardasil sales fell 11 percent to $590 million due to lower purchases by U.S. government programs.  Sales of arthritis treatment Remicade rose 5 percent to $604 million, a marked slowdown from the 17 percent growth seen in the prior quarter, with competition in Europe from cheaper “biosimilar” versions of the medicine. And sales of HIV treatment Isentress fell 3 percent to $412 million, due to increasing competition and reduced purchases by wholesalers. “The foundation with the core franchises is weakening,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said, as Merck pushes ahead with development of promising new treatments for cancer.    Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said company expenses were 6 percent below his expectations, helping to offset the revenue shortfall. Merck shares fell 1.8 percent to $56.55 on the New York Stock Exchange in late afternoon trading.     Early this month, Merck sold its consumer care business to Germany’s Bayer AG for $14.2 billion. Some analysts have called for Merck to sell off other businesses, including older drugs that have lost U.S. patent protection that are sold in emerging markets. But company Chief Executive Kenneth Frazier said they generate cash that can be invested in experimental drugs, and would not be divested without careful consideration. “We will continue to evaluate opportunities as appropriate,” he said on a conference call, referring to potential divestitures. Merck said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had designated its Keytruda immuno-oncology drug as a potential “breakthrough therapy” for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, the most common form of lung cancer.  The “breakthrough” designation, given by the FDA to medicines deemed likely to demonstrate “substantial improvement” over existing drugs, assures fast track review by the agency. Keytruda, approved last month for advanced melanoma, belongs to a new class of drugs that unleash the immune system to fight cancer by blocking a protein known as Programmed Death receptor (PD-1), or a related target PD-L1.  Bristol-Myers Squibb, Roche Holding AG and AstraZeneca Plc are also developing such drugs, and analysts say they could generate more than $30 billion in annual sales by 2025. Merck narrowed its full-year 2014 profit forecast to between $3.46 and $3.50 per share, from its earlier view of $3.43 to $3.53 per share.

Bayer said on Thursday its third-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) came in at 2.01 billion euros ($2.53 billion), edging past the average estimate of 1.96 billion euros in a Reuters poll. Adjusted core earnings at the CropScience unit rose by more than a quarter to 278 million euros, shored up by growth in recently launched products, in particular fungicides and herbicides. Bayer now aims to raise group EBITDA before special items by a mid-single-digit percentage, taking into account the acquisition of Merck & Co. Inc.’s consumer health business it wrapped up on Oct. 1 as well as more favourable currency effects. It had previously forecast a low to medium single-digit percentage gain. The euro was up slightly against the U.S. dollar on average over the third quarter but the European currency has lost about 8 percent against the dollar over the last six months, bolstering the euro-value of overseas revenues. Bayer, the inventor of Aspirin and maker of Yasmin birth-control pills, said pharmaceuticals sales rose by a currency- and portfolio-adjusted 10.3 percent to 3.04 billion euros, boosted by a better-than-expected 70 percent gain of sales in anti-clotting drug Xarelto, mainly used to prevent strokes in the elderly. “Healthcare performance was okay, but the beat was really driven by CropScience, an area where we had concerns,” analysts at brokerage Berenberg said in a note. The shares gained 3.5 percent at 0830 GMT, outperforming a 1 percent gain in the STOXX Europe 600 Health Care index. Bayer shares have advanced 7.6 percent over the past three months, outperforming the 2.3 percent gain in the European sector benchmark, as investors welcomed the company’s plan to split off and separately list its plastics division.

656,MRK,Merck takes steps to return Zilmax to U.S. cattle market,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co. is taking steps to resume sales of its controversial cattle feed additive Zilmax by changing the way the drug is administered, hoping to recapture some market share in the beef industry, where the U.S. herd has the fewest animals in more than 60 years. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved adjustments to the drug’s label that would allow veterinarians and feedlot operators to use a lower dose and alternative method of feeding the drug to beef cattle, Merck said Wednesday.  The new “component feeding” option would allow Zilmax, which can add up to 30 pounds of marketable meat to a 1,300-pound steer, to be fed in one smaller daily ration, rather than continually throughout the day, Merck nutritionist Dr. David Yates told Reuters.  “We began working on this component feeding (label change) several years ago,” Yates said. The decision to do so was prompted by cattle producers, he said, looking for more “efficiency and convenience at a feedyard.” In August 2013, Merck suspended sales of Zilmax in the United States and Canada amid concerns about animals showing signs of distress after use of the weight-gain product. A study published in March suggested that the number of U.S. cattle deaths that may be linked to Zilmax was much higher than the figures reported by the drug company to the federal government. U.S. regulators approved the label change on Friday, Yates said. The label still allows the drug to be fed continually to cattle. Merck, which said Zilmax is safe if properly used, also recently filed a proposed label update in Canada. When Zilmax was pulled off the market, many U.S. feedlot operators switched to ractopamine-based Optaflexx, made by Merck rival Eli Lily & Co.’s Elanco Animal Health unit. Elanco’s patent on ractopamine has expired, and Zoetis Inc’s generic products are eating into Elanco’s dominance.  Zoetis said on Tuesday that sales of livestock products grew 12 percent in the company’s third-quarter, compared to the year-ago period. If Zilmax becomes available to U.S. feedlots again, it could appeal to U.S. livestock industry scrambling for tonnage. Beta-agonist drugs like Zilmax can produce extra meat from a U.S. cattle herd fallen to its lowest point in 63 years.  Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] and Tyson Foods Inc, two of the world’s largest beef processors, have refused to accept Zilmax-feed cattle since last year, following reports it may cause lameness in animals. The companies could not immediately be reached for comment on Merck’s new dosage plan. Merck also said Wednesday it has rolled out a mandatory training program for Zilmax feeding. The company plans field tests of the new “component feeding” program. Merck shares were up 0.2 percent at $59.47 in midday trading.

658,MRK,"Merck expects no writedowns for Zetia, Vytorin cholesterol drugs","(Reuters) - Merck & Co on Monday said long-awaited data from an 18,000-patient trial suggest the company will not have to write down the value of its blockbuster Zetia and Vytorin cholesterol drugs.  “The company has determined that the Zetia and Vytorin intangible assets are not impaired,” the No. 2 U.S. drugmaker said on Monday in a regulatory filing, noting its assessment was based on having seen “unblinded” data from the huge study. Merck’s statement suggests that the study, meant to determine whether Zetia can prevent heart attacks, strokes and deaths, proved favorable to its $2.5 billion-a-year drug. A related Merck drug, Vytorin, pairs Zetia with Merck’s statin Zocor (simvastatin), and has annual sales of $1.5 billion. Pam Eisele, a Merck spokeswoman, said the company had no further comment on the trial results, or their likely financial impact on Zetia and Vytorin.   Merck almost a decade ago began the study, called IMPROVE-IT, to determine whether adding Zetia to simvastatin is better at preventing heart attacks, deaths and strokes than simvastatin alone. Trial results are slated to be unveiled on Nov. 17 in Chicago, at the annual scientific sessions of the American Heart Association. Merck earlier this year warned that it might have to write down the value of Zetia and Vytorin if the study did not prove Zetia provided an incremental benefit to patients. Zetia, which prevents absorption of “bad” LDL cholesterol in the intestines, was approved by U.S. regulators in 2002 based on its ability to lower cholesterol 25 percent beyond reductions seen with simvastatin alone. Statins work by reducing the liver’s production of cholesterol, and can cut LDL levels by 50 percent or more. No previous studies have ever proven conclusively whether Zetia or Vytorin actually improve patient outcomes. Despite longstanding doubts about Zetia’s effectiveness, many doctors have prescribed it and Vytorin on the assumption that Zetia’s demonstrated ability to further lower cholesterol will lead to better patient outcomes.

667,MRK,Merck four-week hep C regimen with Gilead's Sovaldi comes up short,"(Reuters) - An attempt by Merck & Co to shorten hepatitis C treatment to just four weeks by adding Gilead Sciences Inc’s huge selling Sovaldi to its own oral two-drug combination came nowhere near the desired efficacy due to a high rate of relapses, according to interim data from a midstage study. Several companies have been working to find ways to further reduce the number of weeks of treatment needed, while keeping cure rates above 90 percent. A just approved pill called Harvoni that combines Sovaldi  with another Gilead drug requires eight weeks of treatment for many patients, and longer for tougher to treat patients. In the ongoing Merck trial of previously untreated patients, only 38.7 percent had no detectable sign of the liver destroying virus after four weeks of treatment with Sovaldi and Merck’s grazoprevir/elbasvir combination. Nineteen of the 31 patients in the four-week treatment arm relapsed prior to the planned end of the study, which is 12 weeks after completion of dosing. The preliminary data was set to be presented on Monday at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) meeting in Boston. The best result so far in the multi-arm, three-drug study called C-Swift was observed with eight weeks of treatment of patients with cirrhosis in which 94.7 percent had no detectable virus. They will be deemed cured if the virus has not reappeared 12 weeks after stopping treatment. With a six-week regimen in non-cirrhotics, 86.7 percent of patients had no sign of virus up to 8 weeks after completing treatment, according to the interim results. “These findings will inform the design of larger studies aimed at understanding the potential of short-duration triple therapy across multiple patient types,” Dr. Eric Lawitz, the study’s lead investigator, said in a statement. The three drugs each work in a different way to help prevent the virus from replicating. But following failure of the 4-week experiment, Merck said it will turn its attention to studying a combination of three of its own drugs in development rather than involving the Gilead medicine in future studies. The hepatitis C field has been moving at a lightning pace. Only a handful of years ago, patients needed 48 weeks of treatment with drugs that had harsh side effects and only cured about 40 percent of patients. The new all-oral treatments eliminate the need for injectable interferon and its flu-like side effects, as well as another older drug called ribavirin that caused anemia and other problems, while dramatically increasing cure rates and reducing treatment duration.

668,MRK,U.S. gene study raises hope for Merck cholesterol drug Zetia,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Rare mutations in a single gene may help lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of a heart attack by half, U.S. researchers said on Wednesday in a study that could have implications for Merck and Co’s closely watched heart drug Zetia. The study involved individuals with mutations in a gene called NPC1L1, the gene targeted by Zetia, a cholesterol fighter known generically as ezetimibe. While common cholesterol fighters known as statins keep the body from making cholesterol, Zetia blocks the body’s ability to absorb cholesterol in the gut. And while there is clear evidence that statins reduce the risk of heart attacks, there is scant evidence to show that Zetia does much more than lower cholesterol. That is where the new genetic study comes in. Researchers at the Broad Institute and Washington University in St. Louis combed through data on some 113,000 people from multiple studies looking for individuals with rare mutations that shut off the activity of NPC1L1. They found 82 people who inherited a single mutated copy of this gene, leaving them with one working copy. Among these individuals, LDL cholesterol, the so-called “bad” cholesterol, was 10 percent lower than in individuals in the study with two working copies of the gene. People with the mutated gene also had half the risk of heart disease as people with two working copies. Although the findings cannot be used to draw direct conclusions about Zetia, they do suggest that the drug may be hitting an important target for reducing the risk of heart attacks, study author Dr. Nathan Stitziel of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis said in a statement. “Whether ezetimibe specifically is the best way to target NPC1L1 remains an open question,” he said.  That answer may come on Monday when Merck releases the long-awaited results from the large clinical trial called IMPROVE-IT. That trial looks specifically at whether people who took statins plus ezetimibe were less likely to have heart attacks than people who took statins alone. The gene analysis study was funded in part by grants from Merck as well as the National Institutes of Health and the Canadian Institutes of Health.

670,MRK,Future of Merck cholesterol sales could hang on long-awaited study,"(Reuters) - A nine-year, 18,000-patient study of Merck & Co’s $4 billion Zetia and Vytorin cholesterol franchise is likely to show some benefit but keep open the question of whether it can significantly reduce heart attacks, strokes and death.     The Improve-It trial is aimed at determining whether Zetia -  which is also combined with Merck’s now generic statin Zocor (simvastatin) to make Vytorin - does more than reduce “bad” LDL cholesterol in the bloodstream, the basis for which it was approved. Statins have been proven to reduce heart attacks and deaths. Zetia, which lowers LDL in a different way, has been used for a dozen years without any such assurances. Results comparing Vytorin with Zocor alone will be released at the American Heart Association meeting in Chicago next week. “If it’s positive, I’m eager to have another drug I can feel confident is helping people,” said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a prominent cardiologist at Yale-New Haven Hospital. “Now, I generally don’t use it except as a last resort,”  Krumholz said. “This drug lowers your cholesterol quite effectively, but we’re not sure yet whether it actually improves your health.” Merck this week signaled that it had avoided the worst possible outcome, saying in a regulatory filing it will not have to write down the value of Zetia and Vytorin, which could have been necessary if Zetia harmed patients or provided no benefit. Many drug industry analysts expect Vytorin will show some patient benefit, if not a significant one. Combined sales of Zetia and Vytorin have fallen since 2008 as smaller studies raised concerns about safety and effectiveness.      If Improve-It results are favorable, that sales decline “will certainly stabilize and potentially improve,” said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover. Zetia and Vytorin have two more years of U.S. patent life. The study was designed to continue until about 5,200 patients had experienced cardiac-related death, a non-fatal heart attack or stroke or the need for an artery clearing procedure. Due to Zocor’s effectiveness, patients already had LDL levels at the recommended target of 70 or below before adding Zetia. Dr. Steve Nissen, chief of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic, has long criticized that aspect of Improve-It’s design. “It’s studying the drug in a way that nobody uses it clinically,” Nissen said. “We use it when we can’t get them to treatment goal, to try to get them there.”  ",11122014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-heart-merck/future-of-merck-cholesterol-sales-could-hang-on-long-awaited-study-idUSKCN0IW2LD20141112
671,MRK,"Merck's Zetia cuts heart attack, stroke risk in long-awaited study","CHICAGO (Reuters) - After years of uncertainty, a nearly decade-long study showed that Merck & Co’s cholesterol drug Zetia lowered the risk of heart attacks and strokes in high-risk heart patients when used with an effective statin. The data, released on Monday, proves that Zetia - widely used for a dozen years due to its ability to lower “bad” LDL cholesterol - provides important protection to some patients, and supports the theory that bringing LDL down to very low levels adds further benefit. “One of our goals was to test is even lower LDL even better, and the answer is yes,” said Dr. Christopher Cannon, lead investigator of the 18,144-patient Improve-It study presented at the American Heart Association scientific meeting in Chicago. It remains unclear whether the finding will reinvigorate Merck’s $4 billion a year cholesterol franchise of Zetia (ezetimibe) and Vytorin, which combines Zetia with its now-generic statin simvastatin. Several doctors at the meeting said the benefit seen pertains only to the very high risk patients in the study. “This is not a signal that everyone should be on ezetimibe,” said Dr. Neil Stone from Northwestern University School of Medicine in Chicago. Patients had had a heart attack or a dangerous type of chest pain called unstable angina before joining the study. All had their LDL reduced to a target level of about 70 by simvastatin  with Zetia taking LDL down by another 20 percent.   Zetia taken with simvastatin cut heart attacks by 14 percent and strokes caused by diminished blood flow by 21 percent, compared with simvastatin alone. There was no difference in deaths. “In absolute terms, there are two heart attacks or strokes prevented for every 100 patients treated,” Cannon said.  Statins, such as Pfizer’s Lipitor, have long been known to reduce heart attacks, strokes and deaths. There had been no such assurances for Zetia, which lowers cholesterol in a different way.  Sales of Zetia and Vytorin have fallen since 2008 over  safety and effectiveness concerns raised in smaller studies. The Improve-it study should allay any lingering safety fears as there was no difference in cancer, muscle-related problems or liver or gall bladder side effects reported. “An important factor is this is really long term safety,” Cannon said, noting some patients received treatment for almost nine years. Merck shares were up nearly 1 percent at $59.58.

There was no difference in deaths. “In absolute terms, there are two heart attacks or strokes prevented for every 100 patients treated,” Cannon said. Statins, such as Pfizer’s Lipitor, have long been known to reduce heart attacks, strokes and deaths. There had been no such assurances for Zetia, which lowers cholesterol in a different way. Sales of Zetia and Vytorin have fallen since 2008 over  safety and effectiveness concerns raised in smaller studies. The Improve-it study should allay any lingering safety fears as there was no difference in cancer, muscle-related problems or liver or gall bladder side effects reported. “An important factor is this is really long term safety,” Cannon said, noting some patients received treatment for almost nine years.

674,MRK,Regeneron drug highly effective for those who can't take statins: study,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Regeneron Corp’s experimental drug alirocumab helped 10 times as many high-risk patients unable to tolerate widely-used statins get their “bad” LDL cholesterol down to target levels than Merck & Co’s Zetia, according to data from a clinical trial presented on Monday. Alirocumab, developed along with French drugmaker Sanofi, belongs to a new class of potent drugs that block a naturally occurring protein called PCSK9 that prevents the liver from removing LDL from the blood. Patients in the 360-subject study, called Odyssey Alternative, on average had LDL levels above 190 and all were deemed statin intolerant due to muscle and skeletal side effects when taking the popular medicines. After 24 weeks of treatment, alirocumab lowered LDL by 45 percent compared with 14.6 percent for Zetia (ezetimibe). Importantly, 42 percent of alirocumab patients got LDL down to target levels versus 4 percent for Zetia. That rose to 51 percent versus 6 when excluding those who didn’t complete 24 weeks of treatment. Target goals were for LDL under 70 for very high-risk patients and under 100 for high-risk patients.  “It’s a more potent and more effective lipid lowering drug, getting patients to goal by a 10-fold higher amount. It just blows (Zetia) away,” said Dr. Patrick Moriarty, the study’s lead investigator, who presented the results at the American Heart Association scientific meeting in Chicago. Zetia is used to lower LDL in patients who cannot take highly effective statins, such as Pfizer’s Lipitor. They are among the most likely candidates for PCSK9 inhibitors once approved. Curiously, during a four-week preliminary period when all patients were just getting a placebo, 47 dropped out, including 25 complaining of muscular side effects. During the actual treatment period, 18.3 percent of alirocumab patients, 25 percent on Zetia and 25.4 percent who were given Lipitor in a third group discontinued treatment.  In an ongoing extension of the trial, with patients aware of what they were taking, the alirocumab discontinuation rate from muscular side effects fell dramatically. That most patients given Lipitor stayed on therapy calls into question their actual statin intolerance. “This shows you the complexity of diagnosing statin intolerance,” Moriarty said. “This population is not simple.” Regeneron and Sanofi expect to apply for U.S. and European approval this year. But a patent infringement lawsuit filed by Amgen over its rival drug could complicate that.

677,MRK,"Merck's Zetia cuts heart attack, stroke risk in long-awaited study","CHICAGO, Nov 17 (Reuters) - After years of uncertainty, a nearly decade-long study showed that Merck & Co’s  cholesterol drug Zetia significantly lowered the risk of heart attacks and strokes in high-risk heart patients when used with a highly effective statin. The data, released Monday, proves that Zetia - widely used for a dozen years due to its ability to lower “bad” LDL cholesterol levels - provides important protection to some patients, and supports a theory that bringing LDL down to very low levels adds further benefit. “One of our goals was to test - is even lower LDL even better - and the answer is yes,” said Dr. Christopher Cannon, lead investigator of the more than 18,000-patient Improve-It study presented at the American Heart Association meeting in Chicago. The finding could reinvigorate Merck’s $4 billion a year cholesterol franchise of Zetia and Vytorin, which combines Zetia with its now-generic statin Zocor (simvastatin), over their last two years of U.S. patent protection. In the study, Zetia taken with simvastatin cut heart attacks by 14 percent and strokes caused by diminished blood flow by 21 percent, compared with simvastatin alone. There was no difference in deaths between the two groups. “In absolute terms, there are two heart attacks or strokes prevented for every 100 patients treated,” Cannon said. Statins, such as Pfizer’s Lipitor, have long been known to reduce heart attacks, strokes and deaths. There had been no such assurances for Zetia, which lowers cholesterol in a different way. Other types of cholesterol drugs have failed to show additional benefit when added to statins in previous studies, making Zetia the first to do so, researchers said. Patients in the study had had a heart attack or a dangerous type of chest pain called unstable angina before joining the study. All had their LDL reduced to a target level of about 70 before half began also taking Zetia, which reduced LDL by another 20 percent. Sales of Zetia and Vytorin have fallen since 2008 over concerns about safety and effectiveness raised in smaller studies. The Improve-it study may allay any lingering safety fears as there was no difference in cancer, muscle-related problems or liver or gall bladder side effects seen. “An important factor is this is really long term safety,” Cannon said, noting some patients received treatment for nearly nine years.

Earnings reports, merger & acquisition news and appetite for more volatile stocks all provided support for the market. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares edged up 0.1 percent to 1,346.64 points. Pharmaceutical firm Merck rose 3.8 percent, the index’s top riser, after agreeing a deal with Pfizer for sharing rights to develop its experimental immunotherapy drug with the U.S. drugmaker. Shares in Hennes & Mauritz, the world’s second-biggest fashion retailer, also rose strongly, up 2.4 percent after it posted a 14 percent rise in October sales from a year ago, beating forecasts. Andrew Milligan, head of Global Strategy at Standard Life Investments, said that an encouraging earnings season in Europe pointed to strong economic fundamentals which should help a recovery in European equities before year-end. “A major political shock could stop a recovery in its tracks. But the economic fundamentals are generally positive,” Milligan said, giving geopolitical tension with Russia over unrest in Ukraine as one example. “Nobody says that Europe and Japan are going to grow strongly into 2015, but it doesn’t look like they’re on the verge of an extended slow down - rather they’ve been hit by temporary factors like Ukraine and the sales tax increase.” Japan’s economy shrank an annualised 1.6 percent in July-September, following a 7.3 percent drop in the second quarter that was hurt by a sales tax hike hitting consumer spending.

679,MRK,Britain begins review to speed access to new drugs,"* Innovative Medicines and MedTech Review to report in 2015 * Follows criticism that Britain is too slow to adopt new drugs * Britain eager to promote itself as life-science hub * Merck, Becton Dickinson plan 63 mln stg investment LONDON, Nov 20 (Reuters) - The British government has launched a review to speed the path to market for new drugs and medical devices in an attempt to improve patient care and make the country a more attractive place for investment in life sciences. British manufacturing relies heavily on the pharmaceuticals sector, including domestic giants GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca, but companies complain that the state-run National Health Service (NHS) is too slow to adopt new treatments. The review, announced at a meeting between industry leaders and ministers at Prime Minister David Cameron’s Downing Street office on Thursday, aims to tackle the issue by studying innovative models for drug development. This will include an examination of the scope for more collaborative work between companies and regulators to ensure that new medicines and devices are assessed more quickly, with greater input from patient groups and charities such as Cancer Research UK. An independent organisation will be appointed to carry out the Innovative Medicines and MedTech Review, starting work early next year and reporting later in 2015. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry said the initiative is “a big step in the right direction” but that it needs to dovetail with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which assesses whether treatments are sufficiently cost-effective for the NHS. NICE has frequently clashed with industry over its rejection of some expensive new medicines, notably cancer treatments. Cameron first announced a drive to make Britain a leading hub for life sciences in 2011, welcomed at the time by industry. In the latest boost to the sector, United States-based Merck & Co plans to invest at least 42 million pounds ($66 million) in Britain over the next three years, while Becton Dickinson is investing 21 million pounds, the government said. Merck plans a new licensing hub in London and will expand drug research facilities, while Becton Dickinson is to build a plant in southwest England to produce blood separation tubes.

680,MRK,Merck buys rights to NewLink's experimental Ebola vaccine,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) on Monday said it would buy worldwide commercial rights to NewLink Genetics Corp’s (NLNK.O) experimental vaccine against the Ebola virus. NewLink, whose subsidiary licensed commercial rights to the rVSV-EBOV vaccine in 2010, said it would receive $50 million plus royalties from Merck. Large late-stage trials of the product could begin early next year, said Merck, the No. 2 U.S. drugmaker and one of the world’s biggest makers of vaccines. Merck, which will be able to speed up and significantly boost production, will take over development of the vaccine and any follow-on products. The Public Health Agency of Canada, which originally developed the vaccine, will retain non-commercial rights to it.  The deal between Merck and NewLink, a tiny biotechnology company based in Ames, Iowa, comes as other drugmakers are also racing to test and scale up production of treatments and preventive vaccines for Ebola, which has killed more than 5,400 people this year.  It is the worst Ebola outbreak on record. Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia account for all but 15 of the deaths. The Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health, are conducting early-stage trials of the NewLink vaccine. The trials involve healthy volunteers and are testing whether the vaccine is safe and provokes a protective immune response.

683,MRK,"Germany's Merck aims to grow, not sell $1 bln consumer health arm","* Merck KGaA committed to growing over-the-counter division * Dismisses suggestion business might be sold * Unit head says may consider small bolt-on acquisitions By Ben Hirschler LONDON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Merck KGaA aims to keep hold of its consumer healthcare unit, it said on Friday, pledging to develop a business that is expected to generate 2014 sales of $1 billion for the German drugs and chemicals company. The non-prescription market has seen a wave of consolidation this year and a $17 billion deal for Merck to buy laboratory  supplies business Sigma-Aldrich has prompted some bankers to speculate it might consider selling the consumer unit. But the family-controlled company insists it has no intention of quitting. “We really want to stick to that business,” Uta Kemmerich-Keil, chief executive of Merck Consumer Health, said during a media briefing in London highlighting the unit’s strengths. “Our strategy is a pure growth strategy and by the end of this year we will hopefully hit the $1 billion sales mark.” Consumer health is smaller than Merck’s other businesses selling prescription drugs, high-tech chemicals and laboratory  equipment but has strong brands like Seven Seas vitamins and Bion probiotics. It also received a boost in January from the transfer of Neurobion and Floratil, for muscle soreness and diarrhoea, from the prescription drug unit Merck Serono. Kemmerich-Keil said she aimed to have at least three leading brands with a minimum 3 percent market share in key target countries, which include a number of emerging markets, like Brazil, where demand for self-medication is growing strongly. While securing strong positions in local markets could involve small bolt-on acquisitions or licensing deals, she sees no need for large-scale acquisitions, despite recent moves by leading players Bayer and GlaxoSmithKline to boost their OTC footprints. “OTC is a local play, so you need to make sure in the markets you are in that you are strong,” she said. “It’s not important how big the overall business is.” This year’s deal-making has seen Bayer acquire the OTC business of Merck’s U.S. namesake Merck & Co, following a fiercely contested auction also involving Reckitt Benckiser . GSK has also clinched a complex deal for a stake in Novartis’s consumer products, while Perrigo  has agreed to buy Belgian OTC firm Omega Pharma. Following the deals, Germany’s Merck now has a No. 11 position in consumer health.

684,MRK,No serious side effects in Merck/Newlink Ebola vaccine test,"LONDON (Reuters) - The first people vaccinated with an experimental Ebola shot being developed by Merck and NewLink have had no serious side effects so far, but a few experienced mild fever, Swiss researchers said on Tuesday. The shot, one of several being fast-tracked through clinical trials in the hope they can be approved for use in the Ebola epidemic raging in West Africa, is undergoing initial human safety tests at the University Hospitals of Geneva. “After his or her injection, each volunteer was kept under observation for 1.5 hours at the clinical trials unit,” scientists at the Swiss hospital said in a statement.  “To date, no major side effects have been observed after the injections, which triggered the expected inflammatory responses. They (the inflammatory responses) have been weak to moderate, with limited cases of mild fever,” it added. Since 10 November, 34 volunteers have been vaccinated with the shot, known as VSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine, at the request of the World Health Organization (WHO).  Trials have also begun in the United States, Canada, Germany and Gabon, and similar trials should start soon in Kenya. This is the first data from human testing of the Merck/Newlink shot. It follows positive news last week about a GlaxoSmithKline candidate Ebola vaccine, which caused no serious side effects and produced an immune response in 20 volunteers in early-stage trials. A version of GSK’s vaccine targeting only the Zaire strain of Ebola which is causing the current outbreak is undergoing safety trials in Britain, Mali and Switzerland. A trial of an Ebola vaccine from Johnson & Johnson is scheduled to start in January. The Ebola epidemic is the largest ever recorded and has so far infected around 16,000 people, killing almost 6,000 of them, according to latest WHO figures. The vast majority of cases and deaths have been in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Some Ebola experts say it is unlikely the epidemic can be brought under control without the use of a vaccine, which if successful could protect healthy people from being infected with the contagious and deadly virus. Merck announced last month that it would buy the rights to NewLink’s vaccine for $50 million.

Trials have also begun in the United States, Canada, Germany and Gabon, and similar trials should start soon in Kenya. This is the first data from human testing of the Merck/Newlink shot. It follows positive news last week about a GlaxoSmithKline candidate Ebola vaccine, which caused no serious side effects and produced an immune response in 20 volunteers in early-stage trials. A version of GSK’s vaccine targeting only the Zaire strain of Ebola which is causing the current outbreak is undergoing safety trials in Britain, Mali and Switzerland. A trial of an Ebola vaccine from Johnson & Johnson  is scheduled to start in January. The Ebola epidemic is the largest ever recorded and has so far infected around 16,000 people, killing almost 6,000 of them, according to latest WHO figures. The vast majority of cases and deaths have been in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Some Ebola experts say it is unlikely the epidemic can be brought under control without the use of a vaccine, which if successful could protect healthy people from being infected with the contagious and deadly virus. Merck announced last month that it would buy the rights to NewLink’s vaccine for $50 million.

The shot, one of several being rushed through human testing in the hope they can be approved for use in the Ebola epidemic currently raging in West Africa, is going through initial human safety tests at the University Hospitals of Geneva. “After his or her injection, each volunteer was kept under observation for 1.5 hours at the clinical trials unit,” the hospital said in a statement. “To date, no major side effects have been observed after the injections, which triggered the expected inflammatory responses.

687,MRK,Merck immunotherapy drug shows promise against lymphoma: study,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc’s drug that harnesses the immune system to fight cancer showed promise in Hodgkin lymphoma patients whose disease had progressed following prior therapies, according to data from a small, early stage trial being presented at a medical meeting. In the ongoing study of 29 patients, 66 percent had a meaningful response to the drug, Keytruda, after 24 weeks of treatment, including six patients (21 percent) who achieved complete remission. Six other patients in the Keynote-013 study unveiled on Saturday had stable disease at the time data was analyzed, while the lymphoma progressed in four patients. “The drug is outstanding,” said Dr. Craig Moskowitz, the study’s principal investigator from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. “It may be a small patient population, but it is really remarkable,” he said. “And it’s really well tolerated.” There are about 9,000 new cases of Hodgkin lymphoma in the United States in 2014, according to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. About a quarter are likely to relapse after initially successful treatment, highlighting the need for new options.   Keytruda (pembrolizumab) belongs to a new class of drugs called PD-1 inhibitors that have generated great enthusiasm in the medical community. They work by blocking a mechanism tumors use to camouflage themselves from the immune system, allowing it to recognize and attack the cancer. Patients in the study had either had a stem cell transplant or were ineligible for one, and all had been previously treated with the Seattle Genetics Inc drug Adcetris. The average time to response with Keytruda was 12 weeks, according to data being presented at the American Society of Hematology meeting in San Francisco. The median duration of response had not yet been reached. Patients will stay on the drug until their cancer progresses. Keytruda this year was approved to treat advanced melanoma - the deadliest form of skin cancer - making it the first drug from the PD-1 class to reach the U.S. market. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co is developing a rival medicine.    This marks the first Keytruda data reported against a type of blood cancer. It is also being tested in lung, breast, bladder, gastric, and head and neck cancers. The most common side effect was shortness of breath, Moskowitz said.

689,MRK,Merck in talks to acquire Cubist Pharmaceuticals for more than $7 billion: NYT,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc is in talks to acquire Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc for more than $7 billion in a deal that could be announced as early as next week, the New York Times reported on Friday, citing people briefed on the matter. Merck will likely pay roughly $100 a share for Cubist, valuing the company that makes drugs to fight superbugs, in the range of $7.5 billion, the people said. (nyti.ms/1IbKXcJ) Merck could pay a 33 percent premium for Cubist, the sources told the newspaper, but it was not clear if it would pay for Cubist shares with cash, stock or a combination of the two. Lexington, Massachusetts-based Cubist is valued at about $5.7 billion as of its Friday close of $74.36. The antibiotic maker’s shares rose about 22.7 percent to $91.25 on the Nasdaq in extended trade. Up to Friday’s close, the stock had nearly doubled over the last three years. Merck’s shares were flat.   Both companies were unavailable for comment outside of regular business hours. Cubist reported a 16 percent jump in third-quarter sales in October, driven by strong sales of its antibiotic Cubicin, which generated global sales of more than $1 billion last year. The company received U.S. regulatory approval for its antibiotic Sivextro in June. It awaits an FDA decision on another antibiotic, ceftolozane/tazobactam, on Dec. 21. In June, Merck acquired Idenix Pharmaceuticals for $3.85 billion, to boost its hepatitis C drug portfolio.

The deal is the latest sign that large pharmaceutical companies are turning their attention back to antibiotics after decades of low investment. The spread of superbugs that evade even the most powerful antibiotics threatens modern medicine, the World Health Organization said in April, warning of “a post-antibiotic era” in which common infections were killers once again. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated last year that more than 2 million people in the United States are sickened every year by superbug infections, with at least 23,000 dying as a result. (1.usa.gov/1w5Hhml) Merck said on Monday that the deal, which will give it access to Cubist’s antibiotic Cubicin, is expected to add more than $1 billion to revenue in 2015 after closing in the first quarter, but will be neutral to non-GAAP earnings per share until 2016. Cubist’s third-quarter sales rose 16 percent, driven by strong sales of Cubicin. Cubist may lose patent protection for Cubicin earlier than expected, after a Friday federal court ruling that invalidated four of its patents. If the ruling stands, it will allow Hospira Inc to launch a generic version of the drug in 2016. Merck could not immediately be reached for comment on the ruling. Cubist’s lead drug in development, Ceftolozane/Tazobactam, is widely expected to win marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration later this month as a treatment for complicated urinary tract infections. Merck will pay $102 per share for Cubist, a premium of 37 percent to the Lexington, Massachussetts-based company’s closing share price of $74.36 on Friday. The deal includes assumption of $1.1 billion in debt. “Cubist is a global leader in antibiotics and has built a strong portfolio of both marketed and late-stage pipeline medicines,” Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier said in a statement. “Combining this expertise with Merck’s strong capabilities and global reach will enable us to create a stronger position in hospital acute care while addressing critical areas of unmet medical need, such as antibiotic resistance.” Merck has said it is focusing on acute care within hospitals - considered a hotbed for superbug infections such as bacterial pneumonia - as a top priority. Many drugmakers have cut investment in the past because antibiotics are typically low-priced and used for only short periods, generating poor returns. That has fueled demands for a rethink of the antibiotic market model. It has also left Cubist as a leading investor in the field, with an annual research budget for antibiotics of $400 million. More recently, however, there have been signs of a revival, with Roche Holding AG, GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Sanofi SA all investing in new approaches to fight superbugs. Cubist shares were trading at $101.04 premarket. Merck shares were unchanged from Friday’s close at $61.50. The New York Times, citing people briefed on the matter, first reported the deal on Friday.

693,MRK,Breakingviews: Merck bets $8.4 bln on more profitable antibiotics,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Superbugs may have beneficial side effects - for giant pharmaceutical companies. In agreeing to buy Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Merck  is betting $8.4 billion that the antibiotics used to fight them will become more profitable. In the 1990s and 2000s, big pharma lost interest in new antibiotics. Existing drugs worked very well and were cheap, so there seemed little reason to spend heavily to develop new ones. Regulators demanded more stringent trials after one approved drug turned out to have life-threatening side effects. That raised costs further. And a perverse financial logic ruled: antibiotics usually cure patients rapidly, limiting revenue. The pursuit by the likes of Cubist of new ways to treat bacterial diseases looked increasingly lonely. The mood has, however, been changing as bacteria have developed resistance to existing antibiotics. The World Health Organization warned earlier this year that gonorrhea could soon become untreatable. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that the extra cost of treating antibiotic-resistant infections runs up to $35 billion a year. That could rocket higher as infections become harder to contain. In response Uncle Sam is spending more on research and development and U.S. regulators are giving new drugs that combat life-threatening infections an extra five years of market exclusivity. They are also promising to approve new antibiotics quickly. The drive by governments worldwide to tie drug prices to efficacy will help further. New cancer treatments can cost $100,000 but may only add a few months of life. Antibiotics that permanently cure fatal diseases for $3,000 look cheap in comparison. That could mean a renaissance for antibiotics, with profit opportunities to match. But the pace of drug development is still glacial, which makes big drug groups eager to buy companies that already have compounds in clinical trials. Despite the above-average outlook for new antibiotics and the fact that Cubist has one potential blockbuster that just hit the market and another awaiting approval, Merck is paying only about 4.3 times Cubist’s estimated revenue for next year. That’s about the same multiple as investors give Merck’s own business, making it look like a relative bargain. More alarm about superbugs will only make the deal look better. - Merck said on Dec. 8 that it would acquire Cubist Pharmaceuticals for $8.4 billion, or $102 per share. The drug company will also take on the antibiotic maker’s debt. Merck is paying a 37 percent premium based on Cubist’s closing price on Dec. 5, the last day of trading before the deal was announced. - In June, Merck paid $3.9 billion for Idenix, a biotech company developing treatments for hepatitis C. - Company statement: bit.ly/1vEyzg6 - Reuters: Merck to take on superbugs with Cubist Pharma buy - For previous columns by the author, Reuters customers can click on    (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

694,MRK,Cubist options unusually active before Merck deal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc options had one of their most active weeks this year last week ahead of Monday’s announcement that Merck & Co will buy Cubist for a hefty premium. One series of trades on Thursday appears to have generated at least a 10-fold windfall profit on paper. Merck said it will pay $102 a share for Cubist, 37 percent above the Lexington, Massachussetts, company’s closing share price of $74.36 on Friday. Cubist shares were up 35 percent at $100.70 on Monday. Open interest in Cubist call options, which convey the right to buy the stock at a fixed price in the future, jumped by 25 percent between Dec. 1 and Dec. 5 to 13,864 contracts, according to Trade Alert data. That ranks among the largest increases in open interest over a five-day period this year for Cubist calls. On average, Cubist options are not very actively traded, but trading volume was unusually heavy on Thursday, said Fred Ruffy, options strategist at WhatsTrading.com.  Ruffy also noted an increase in Cubist’s implied volatility, a gauge of the risk of large moves in a stock and a key component to options pricing. Implied volatility jumped to 51.49 percent on Thursday from 43.15 percent on Wednesday, according to Livevol Inc data. One call strike in particular saw a big increase in activity on Thursday. Around 1,000 Cubist calls at the $85 strike and set to expire on Jan. 17 were bought for between $1.25 to $1.50, according to Livevol Inc data. Ahead of those trades on Thursday afternoon, the January 85 calls had fewer than 300 contracts of open interest, according to Reuters data. By the end of the day that had risen to more than 1,300. Since going on the board in October 2013, the average volume of January 85 calls had been about 14 contracts a day, and their largest daily total before Thursday had been 175 contracts. Thursday’s volume was more than 45 standard deviations above the norm. “To expect the stock to move past $85 and be willing to pay over a $1 for it with about a month and a half to go suggests that they were expecting some kind of major catalyst,” said optionMonster.com lead analyst David Russell. Until Monday, the high for Cubist shares was $82.12, set in February this year. With the stock soaring to a record above $100 on the merger news, the January 85 calls are now quoted at about $16, making for a huge profit on the trades, Russell said. One other possible catalyst for the shares involves a possible resolution of a lawsuit surrounding a generic challenge to Cubist’s lead drug, Cubicin, by Hospira Inc. A settlement or verdict in the case has been seen coming in December or January and analysts tracking the stock had expected that to have big implications for Cubist shares.

People are looking at is as temporary, and somewhere down the line as those economies get stronger, everybody will be in pretty good shape.” Biotech shares rallied after Merck & Co Inc said it would buy Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc for $8.4 billion plus the assumption of debt. Merck shares were off 1 cent at$61.48 while Cubist shares surged 35.5 percent to $100.75. The Nasdaq biotech index advanced 2.1 percent. Energy was easily the worst performing S&P; sector, down 2.7 percent, as Brent crude fell to a five-year low on predictions oversupply would keep building until next year. The index is down more than 10 percent for the year, making it the only one of the 10 major S&P; sectors in negative territory for the year.

700,MRK,Cubist sales force seen as potential boon for Merck intestinal drug,"(Reuters) - In its planned purchase of antibiotics maker Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc, Merck & Co will gain a sales force well placed to propel its own experimental drug for an intestinal bug, C. difficile, that is a scourge among hospital patients. Merck announced on Monday an agreement to buy Cubist for $8.4 billion, with a focus on Cubist’s drugs that address the growing threat of bacteria that are resistant to conventional antibiotics. [ID:nL3N0TS3VA]  As many as 14,000 Americans die each year from C. difficile infections, which are spread by spores in hospitals. They take root in patients who have been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics that kill off “friendly” bacteria in the gut, allowing C. difficile bacteria to multiply.  C. difficile can cause colitis, including attacks of diarrhea and fever that can recur and are not well controlled by current treatments. Merck’s experimental drug, called MK-3415A, combines two antibodies that chew up deadly toxins produced by C. difficile. New data on its effectiveness is expected from two late-stage clinical trials in 2015.  If the data is favorable, Merck could seek approval of the drug - the first antibody treatment for bacterial toxins - by early 2016. “This is a blockbuster market opportunity for Merck,” said Kevin Kedra, an analyst for Gabelli & Co. Cubist’s expertise in turning its biggest product, the antibiotic Cubicin, into a $1 billion-a-year franchise could bode well for Merck. “Cubist is a company that built itself into an antibiotic power when bigger companies were getting out the business,” Kedra said. Adam Schechter, head of global human health at Merck, said Cubist’s sales force would strengthen Merck’s relationships with insurers, gastroentrologists, infectious disease doctors, hospitals and outpatient centers. Cubist has the best-selling treatment for the condition, Dificid, but up to 15 percent of patients have relapses, sending many of them back to the hospital for retreatment. It also faces competition from far cheaper generics, including vancomycin. If Merck’s treatment is approved, it is more likely to face competition down the road from products containing human fecal matter. The “fecal transplants,” which reintroduce healthy bacteria into the gastrointestinal tract, have proven extremely effective. But it could take years for a commercial version to be approved. “Merck couldn’t have a better infrastructure than Cubist to launch its drug,” said Ori Hershkowitz, a Tel Aviv-based partner for Sphera Funds. “They know how to negotiate the healthcare system.” ",12092014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-merck-antibiotics/cubist-sales-force-seen-as-potential-boon-for-merck-intestinal-drug-idUSKBN0JN2NY20141209

705,MRK,Breakingviews: Merck gives in to M&A; frenzy risk assessment,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - The M&A; frenzy appears to have influenced Merck’s risk assessment. Just hours after unveiling its $8.4 billion acquisition of Cubist Pharmaceuticals on Monday, a judge invalidated patents owned by the antibiotics maker. Potential lost sales are reflected in the billions erased from Merck’s market value. Cubist’s biggest drug is Cubicin, which currently accounts for nearly all the company’s estimated $1.2 billion in annual sales. The ruling by a Delaware court means Cubist could face generic competition in the United States as soon as the middle of 2016, instead of waiting until 2020. The healthy 37 percent premium Merck paid for Cubist, and the limited wiggle room it left itself to pull out of the deal, suggests it was undeterred by the outstanding legal danger. There are other known unknowns, too. For one, Cubist will soon go before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to seek approval of a new antibiotic, which could be a blockbuster. Waiting for confirmation might have increased the takeover tab or left the door open for an interloping suitor. Assuming regulators sign off, though, Merck’s experienced presence might smooth the launch. Even so, there is probably a higher cost for its aggression. Cubist is worth less today than it was yesterday. Merck argues the deal still creates value. Investors took a less charitable view, wiping more than $8 billion, or almost the entire purchase price, from Merck’s market capitalization. It is probably an overreaction. Absent a successful appeal of the legal ruling, based on existing sales, the foregone Cubicin revenue should add up to no more than $3 billion in a worst-case scenario. Other buyers may want to pay heed to Merck’s misstep. There already have been more than $3 trillion of deals announced globally this year, an increase of some 50 percent from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters. Healthcare has been a leading sector, with more than twice as much activity this year than last. That makes it that much easier for buyers to get caught up in the excitement and look at potential merger liabilities though a rose-colored prism. -  A Delaware judge on Dec. 8 invalidated several patents protecting Cubist Pharmaceuticals’ Cubicin, allowing rival Hospira to sell the drug as soon as 2016. The patents would have provided market exclusivity until 2020. - Earlier the same day, Merck said it would buy Cubist for $8.4 billion. Following the patent ruling, Merck said it would stand by its agreement. Cubist said it would appeal the court’s decision. - Merck shares fell 4.4 percent in morning trading on Dec. 9 and Cubist’s were down 3.7 percent.

707,MRK,UPDATE 2-Ebola vaccine trial halted temporarily after joint pains -Geneva hospital,"* Merck-NewLink trial in Geneva halted after joint pains * Lausanne says safety data “satisfactory” in GSK vaccine trial   (Adds statement on GSK Ebola vaccine, new paras 4-7) By Stephanie Nebehay GENEVA, Dec 11 (Reuters) - A clinical trial of an Ebola vaccine developed by Merck and NewLink has been halted temporarily as a precautionary measure after four patients complained of joint pains, the University of Geneva Hospital said on Thursday. “They are all fine and being monitored regularly by the medical team leading the study,” it said in a statement. The trials will resume on Jan. 5, on up to 15 volunteers, after checks to ensure that the joint pain symptoms in hands and feet were “benign and temporary”, the hospital said. Fifty nine volunteers have been vaccinated so far in the human safety trials in Geneva, which began on Nov. 10. Scientists are racing to develop Ebola vaccines after the world’s worst outbreak of the virus has killed more than 6,000 people in West Africa so far this year. Separately, safety data from a trial of a GlaxoSmithKline  Ebola vaccine on 120 volunteers is “satisfactory”, the University of Lausanne Hospital said on Thursday. The first results of the Lausanne hospital’s trial of the GSK vaccine and whether it provides immunity against the virus are expected by the end of December, the university said in a statement. “The safety data looked satisfactory so far,” said Professor Blaise Genton, who is leading the GSK trial in Lausanne. “General symptoms such as fever might be slightly more frequent, though no serious adverse event has been observed so far.” Scientists reported on Nov. 26 in the New England Journal of Medicine that another version of the experimental GSK vaccine caused no serious side effects and produced an immune response in all 20 healthy volunteers who received it in an early-stage trial. The Geneva researchers reported on Dec. 2 that the first people vaccinated with the Merck-NewLink shot had seen no serious side effects, but a few had mild fever. On Thursday, the team said that four patients had reported joint pains in the second week that had lasted a few days. Before it was suspended, this first phase of the trial had been due to continue for another week. “The Geneva team has decided to allow time to understand what is happening. This precaution of momentarily suspending the trial is usual and classic in all clinical trials,” the team said. It was in close contact with researchers in the United States, Germany, Canada and Gabon who are carrying out the same trial on the Merck-NewLink vaccine, it said. “These centres have not observed symptoms of inflammation in their volunteers to date.” Marie-Paule Kieny, vaccine expert at the World Health Organisation, said that the delay to the Merck-NewLink trial would allow time to see how widespread the problems are, but the trial should then be able to continue as originally planned. “It’s not a setback, not at all,” Kieny told a briefing. GAVI, the global vaccines alliance, pledged $300 million on Thursday to buy Ebola vaccines.

Scientists are racing to develop Ebola vaccines in record time but many questions remain unanswered, as evidenced by a decision to pause Swiss tests of the experimental vaccine from NewLink and Merck. GAVI, which is funded by governments and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, said it was ready to begin procurement as soon as the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended a vaccine for use. The world’s worst Ebola outbreak has killed more than 6,000 people in West Africa and experts believe millions of doses of vaccine may be needed both to help end the current epidemic and to contain future outbreaks. Officials involved in the Swiss study said the volunteers who had received the NewLink shot were all fine and the WHO played down the problem, pointing out that temporary suspensions were not uncommon in clinical trials. Researchers hope safe and effective vaccines will get a green light as soon as next year, although there is still uncertainty over how well they will work and how many doses are needed. Paying for vaccines is a challenge because the worst affected countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea are some of the world’s poorest, providing little commercial incentive for manufacturers. The money now earmarked by Geneva-based GAVI will help bridge the gap and is expected to be enough to procure up to 12 million courses of vaccine. WHO vaccine expert Marie-Paule Kieny said the commitment was “fantastic”. In addition to helping in the current epidemic, the money could also be used to create stockpiles of Ebola vaccines, similar to those that exist for yellow fever, meningitis and cholera. A further amount of up to $90 million will be made available from GAVI’s coffers to help affected countries introduce the vaccines and to rebuild their health systems. GAVI, which was set up in 2000 with private and government donor backing, has a track record of bulk-buying vaccine supplies from manufacturers at a low price for the developing world. Since 2000, around 440 million children have been immunised against a range of diseases through its programmes. GAVI said its board had decided to prepare for procuring Ebola vaccines while still awaiting a green light for the first product, “in light of the seriousness of the situation and the risks associated with delays in making a vaccine available”. Two vaccines, one from NewLink and Merck and a rival shot from GlaxoSmithKline, are already undergoing human trials and third one, made by Johnson & Johnson, is about to enter clinical testing. “We’ve had individual discussions with all of the manufacturers and continue to work closely with them,” GAVI’s chief executive, Seth Berkley, told Reuters. GAVI said it would meet the funding needs of the Ebola vaccine programme using a combination of existing and new financing. It also plans to join forces with other initiatives that have already pledged funding to address the Ebola crisis.

709,MRK,One shot or two? Many questions unresolved in Ebola vaccine race,"* Debate over “prime-boost” vaccination as epidemic evolves * Two shots offer more protection but cumbersome to deliver * Disease slowdown may weaken clinical trial results * GSK, J&J;/Bavarian and Merck/NewLink vaccines studied By Ben Hirschler and Kate Kelland LONDON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Scientists racing to develop vaccines against Ebola are trying to determine whether they can best fight the disease with a single injection or with two, a calculation that could determine how quickly and effectively a programme can be rolled out. Administering two vaccines, one after the other, would almost certainly give far greater protection than a single shot against a deadly virus that has killed more than 6,000 people in West Africa this year. But it would also make mass immunisations far more complicated in the worst-affected countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where weak health systems have all but collapsed under the weight of the epidemic. With the epidemic growing exponentially through much of 2014, the initial focus was on developing a single shot that could be tested and deployed as fast as possible. Now, however, with disease transmission rates tailing off markedly in Liberia, there is more debate about a double vaccine programme that would provide greater protection, even if it might take longer and be harder to implement. “There is now more and more talk about what can we do to prolong vaccine protection,” said Ripley Ballou, head of Ebola research at GlaxoSmithKline, which has one of the leading vaccine candidates. He still hopes a single-dose vaccine will be of use in the current outbreak, but also sees a need to evaluate the “prime-boost” approach of giving a first shot to stimulate the immune system, followed by a second booster a few weeks later. Health officials in London and Washington, as well as non-profit groups like the Wellcome Trust that are also helping fund clinical trials, are liaising closely on the best way forward. “We’re trying to decide where it is best to put the money,” said one senior government adviser. A big Liberia trial, involving up to 30,000 participants, will test single shots of GSK’s vaccine, a rival one from NewLink and Merck, and a placebo. Although the Ebola slowdown in Liberia is clearly good news, it means the trial may not see enough new cases of disease to demonstrate the benefit of vaccination. Other studies are starting to analyse the prime-boost approach. Johnson & Johnson expects to start testing its experimental shot with a booster developed by Denmark’s Bavarian Nordic “very soon” and its chief scientific officer, Paul Stoffels, is convinced this is the right strategy. “It is cumbersome, because you need two vaccines, but it is clear that you will get the best protection, both short and long term, from a prime-boost,” he said. A prime-boost vaccine will be more difficult to make in large quantities, since the booster component from Bavarian needs to be grown in chicken eggs, limiting supply. But past experience suggests it should pack more punch. Tests of similar two-pronged vaccines in other diseases suggest the booster component can increase immune responses around 30-fold for the production of antibodies and up to 10-fold for the body’s own disease-fighting T-cells - two of the key elements of the ability to fight off infection - said Adrian Hill, a vaccine expert at Oxford University’s Jenner Institute. That extra protection may be needed in West Africa, where infection with malaria could also depress people’s immune systems, limiting the effectiveness of immunisation. In the end, the wide programme of vaccine trials scheduled for the first half of 2015 may yield a variety of options, with some experts suggesting prime-boost may be particularly suited for healthcare workers facing regular high exposure and single shots the preferred choice for rapid containment of local cases. So far, the only human data on how well Ebola vaccines might work comes from the United States and Europe, with GSK’s shot proving safe and showing some efficacy, although not comprehensive protection. NewLink’s experimental shot had no serious side effects but caused some mild fever. With the epidemic still raging, tests are likely to try out combinations of vaccines in an opportunistic way. While their impact may not become clear until later next year, the lessons learned will still be valuable in responding to the next, inevitable, Ebola outbreak. “This disease is going to be endemic in West Africa,” said GSK’s Ballou. “It’s important for those countries either to have routine vaccination or a stockpile option.”   (Editing by Peter Graff)",12112014,http://www.reuters.com/article/health-ebola-vaccine/one-shot-or-two-many-questions-unresolved-in-ebola-vaccine-race-idUSL6N0TU2OE20141211

Tetraphase shares rose 17.5 percent in after-hours trading. The drug, eravacycline, treats infections caused by gram-negative bacteria, a class of antibiotic-resistant pathogens commonly called superbugs.

715,MRK,UPDATE 1-New GSK shingles vaccine may challenge Merck after strong test data,"* GSK vaccine cuts risk of shingles by 97.2 pct in over 50s * Potentially strong competitor for Merck’s Zostavax * Shares in GSK partner Agenus jump 10 percent   (Adds sales figures for Merck vaccine, forecast for GSK product) By Ben Hirschler LONDON, Dec 18 (Reuters) - An experimental shingles vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline has produced impressive results in a late-stage study, giving the group’s expanding vaccine unit a potential $1 billion boost. The data suggests the British company’s new shot could be a strong competitor for Merck & Co’s established vaccine Zostavax, which is currently the only product on the market. GSK’s vaccine, known as HZ/su, reduced the risk of shingles by 97.2 percent in adults aged 50 years and older compared to placebo in the Phase III clinical trial involving more than 16,000 individuals, the drugmaker said on Thursday. That result looks compelling compared to Zostavax, which has showed 69.8 percent efficacy in patients aged 50 to 59 years, and lower efficacy in older people. However, the design of different clinical trials means direct comparisons are tricky. The two vaccines work in different ways. Zostavax is a so-called live attenuated virus vaccine while HZ/su combines a protein found on the virus that causes shingles with an adjuvant, or booster, which is intended to enhance the immunological response. The adjuvant includes a component from U.S. biotech firm Agenus, which is entitled to royalties on any future sales. Shares in Agenus jumped 10 percent in early U.S. trading on news of the good results. GSK has not said when HZ/su might reach the market and a company spokeswoman said more data would be collected on the experimental shot next year. Additional trials to evaluate the ability of HZ/su to prevent shingles are also underway in people aged 70 and older and in immunocompromised patients. The full set of safety data from the Phase III trial is currently being analysed and will be disclosed in the coming months, the company added. Merck’s Zostavax, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2006, generated sales of $758 million last year and is still growing strongly, since only a minority of elderly people have so far been vaccinated. Its sales are expected to reach $1.1 billion by 2019, according to consensus forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters Cortellis. With potential superior efficacy, UBS said in a research note that sales of GSK’s vaccine might exceed $1 billion a year. Shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox. After an attack of chickenpox, the virus lies dormant in certain nerve tissue but in older people in can reappear in the form of shingles.

716,MRK,CORRECTED-Connections between drug makers and educators abound,"(Corrects second paragraph to say “scholarships funded by Merck, Zoetis, Cargill and others this year.”) By Duff Wilson and Mimi Dwyer Dec 23 (Reuters) - The pharmaceutical industry has strong ties to veterinary education across the United States, providing financial support to professors, researchers and students. Zoetis, the world’s leading animal drug maker, has given $3.6 million in scholarships over the past five years to more than 1,100 U.S. veterinary students. The American Association of Bovine Practitioners, a beef veterinary group, provided $300,000 in grants and scholarships funded by Merck, Zoetis, Cargill and others this year. A four-year veterinary education costs well over $200,000, and students often leave school with significant debt. But five pharmaceutical companies have donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to help veterinary students pay back loans. One condition: that the students practice food-animal medicine for four years. Some students also are paid to serve as representatives of pharmaceutical companies on their campuses. “I don’t think they’re pushing anything that’s going to affect how we practice as veterinarians, but it certainly could be viewed that way,” said Alexander Thomson, the Zoetis student representative at Cornell veterinary college. He declined to say how much he is paid. Leading veterinary professors are also accepting money from the pharmaceutical industry for everything from research to company-scripted promotional speaking. Such speaking arrangements are banned by many university medical faculties, according to Eric Campbell, a Harvard University professor who studies conflicts of interest between medical doctors and drug companies. “The fact that they’re being supported by the companies they’re supposed to be overseeing raises issues about the impact of those payments,” he said. Pamela Ruegg, a professor of dairy science at the University of Wisconsin, was paid to speak by Zoetis, among others. Then, she said, Zoetis stopped inviting her to forums when she voiced concerns that antibiotics were being overused on farms. “They wouldn’t sponsor me as a speaker because they’re mad at me,” Ruegg said. “My message is we have to reduce the amount of antimicrobial use and use it properly.” Last week, however, Ruegg said a Zoetis representative called her to ask if the company could distribute a YouTube video she made and a paper she wrote advocating more “watchful waiting” and less antibiotic usage on dairy farms. “It’s a favorable development,” she said. Zoetis declined to comment. Mark Papich, a professor of clinical pharmacology at North Carolina State’s veterinary college, has received speaking and consulting fees, honoraria, research grants or gifts from nearly every pharmaceutical company, a fact he talks about openly. “It’s a matter of survival for us to try and get support from the pharmaceutical companies,” he said.

717,MRK,Merck-NewLink Ebola vaccine trial resumes at lower dose: Geneva hospital,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The clinical trial of an Ebola vaccine developed by Merck and NewLink resumed on Monday at a lower dose after a pause to assess complaints of joint pains in some volunteers, the University of Geneva hospital said.  An Ebola outbreak, the worst on record of the highly infectious hemorrhagic fever, has killed over 7,900 people over the past year, with more than 20,000 cases recorded mostly in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The virus is still spreading in West Africa, especially in Sierra Leone.  The Geneva hospital announced on Dec. 11 that its vaccine trial had been suspended as a precautionary measure after four patients complained of joint pains. On Monday, the hospital said 10 of 59 volunteers who received the vaccine had felt pains in their joints “similar to rheumatism” after some two weeks, but these symptoms had disappeared rapidly without any treatment. Swissmedic, the Swiss regulatory agency, and ethics and safety committees have approved the resumption of the trial at a lower dose, the hospital said in a statement.  “The second part of this clinical trial will now test a dose of 300,000 vaccine particles, which should be better tolerated by volunteers and will hopefully trigger the production of enough antibodies,” it said, noting that the initial phase had 10 million to 50 million vaccine particles. “Fortunately”, it said, the Merck-NewLink candidate vaccine “seems able to induce the production of antibodies at lower doses than those previously used” in the Geneva trial.  Vaccinations have now resumed for the last 56 volunteers, who will receive either a low dose of the vaccine or a placebo, by groups of 15 each week through January, it said.  Geneva researchers are constantly exchanging information with teams carrying out similar studies in Canada, Gabon, Germany and the United States, the hospital said. Final results are expected in March 2015. A separate trial of a GlaxoSmithKline Ebola vaccine on 120 volunteers has proved “satisfactory”, the University of Lausanne Hospital said on Dec. 11.

718,MRK,UPDATE 2-Cempra's lead oral antibiotic meets main goal in late-stage trial,"(Adds market value figure in paragraph 3) By Natalie Grover and Vidya L Nathan Jan 5 (Reuters) - Cempra Inc moved a step closer to approval for its lead antibiotic, solithromycin, after an oral version of the potential blockbuster met the main goal in a late-stage trial. Investment by Big Pharma in antibiotic research has revived as bacteria grow increasingly resistant to existing drugs, leading Merck & Co to bid for Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc  and casting other antibiotic drug developers as potential targets. Shares of Cempra, among a clutch of smaller companies developing treatments to fight super-bugs, rose as much as 18 percent to $27.10 in early trading on Monday. Up to Friday’s close, the company’s shares had gained 43 percent since Merck’s announcement on Dec .8. At Monday’s high, Cempra was valued at about $970 million. Cempra Chief Executive Prabha Fernandes, speaking on a call with analysts, reiterated that the company was not looking for partners. The drug is a next-generation version of a class of oft-prescribed antibiotics called macrolides, which are used to fight pathogens that cause community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CAPB). CAPB is the leading cause of death from infection and is characterized by shortness of breath, cough and fever. About 5-10 million cases are recorded in the United States annually. An oral formulation of solithromycin was as effective as Bayer AG’s moxifloxacin 72 hours after dosing, Cempra said on Sunday. WBB Securities’ Steve Brozak raised his price target on the stock to $40 from $25, estimating that solithromycin was worth about $1.4 billion to Cempra. On the call, a company executive said there were no signs of any serious adverse reactions in the solithromycin study. Prior-generation macrolides have triggered safety concerns. Sanofi SA’s telithromycin, for example, was associated with liver toxicity, while Pfizer Inc’s  azithromycin was linked to heart risk. The unparalleled rate at which the oral version of solithromycin is absorbed in the blood, or its oral bioavailability, differentiates it from standard treatments, Fernandes told Reuters in an interview in November. North Carolina-based Cempra is also evaluating an intravenous formulation of solithromycin for CAPB. Cempra expects to update investors on the study in April 2015, Fernandes said. The drug is also the first pediatric antibiotic-in-development in nearly three decades, she said. Solithromycin is commercially licensed to Fujifilm Holdings Corp in Japan.

720,MRK,"Merck, Bristol heat up immunotherapy race in lung cancer","(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck & Co broke further away from rival drugmakers in the race to treat lung cancer with a new generation of immune system therapies, adding pressure on the likes of Roche and AstraZeneca to play catch-up. Merck said it would file an application with U.S. regulators in the middle of this year seeking expanded use of its new Keytruda treatment for non-small cell lung cancer, the most common form of the deadly disease.  That followed a late Sunday announcement by Bristol-Myers that independent monitors halted a trial of its Opdivo treatment for lung cancer when it became clear the drug extended survival compared with standard chemotherapy.   While the magnitude of the benefit was not yet known, it marked the first time the new class of immunotherapy demonstrated an overall survival benefit in lung cancer.        Some industry analysts expect this class, known as PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors, to generate more than $30 billion in worldwide annual sales by 2025, with lung cancer seen as the most lucrative use. Keytruda and Opdivo are already approved to treat advanced melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer. They work by blocking a mechanism used by tumors to hide from disease fighting immune system cells. Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson sees Merck closing a perceived gap with Bristol-Myers in using their drugs for lung cancer. “The review time for Merck’s application could be on the order of a few months,” implying approval in the second half of 2015, nearly a year earlier than Wall Street had expected, Anderson said in a note. As a result, “Merck may only be about six months behind Bristol-Myers in bringing its product to market.” Bristol has not said when it expects an approval decision for Opdivo as a treatment for lung cancer. Leerink Partners analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a research note that Merck’s rapid advancement may pose a setback to similar programs from Roche and AstraZeneca.  Roche’s timeline for seeking regulatory approval remains unclear, Fernandez noted. AstraZeneca, meanwhile, may not be able to secure an accelerated review in lung cancer if the Bristol-Myers or Merck drug is already on the market, potentially adding several months to a decision on its contender. Roche said it expects pivotal data for its PD-L1 drug in lung and bladder cancer in the first half of this year, with potential filings seeking approval in the second half if the trials are successful.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths globally, killing more than 1.5 million people each year, according the World Health Organization.

722,MRK,"Merck speeds up drug-submission plans for Hep C, lung cancer","(Reuters) - Merck & Co said it would fast track its plans to submit new drugs for hepatitis C and lung cancer for regulatory approval. The drugmaker is trying to close the gap with competitors in the two lucrative segments.  Gilead Sciences Inc’s hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi — priced at $84,000 per course — notched up sales of $2.8 billion in the company’s latest quarter. Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved AbbVie Inc’s all-oral hepatitis C treatment, priced lower than Gilead’s drugs. Merck said it planned to file an application with the FDA in the first half of the year for marketing approval for grazoprevir/elbasvir, a new two-drug, single-pill combination to treat hepatitis C. The company had said in November that it planned to submit the new drug application sometime in 2015.  Merck also said it would file an application midyear for expanding the use of its new cancer immunotherapy Keytruda to include the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer, the most common form of the deadly disease.  Merck’s plan to speed up the drug submissions was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Keytruda belongs to a new class of drugs, called PD-1 inhibitors, that have generated great enthusiasm in the medical community.  They work by blocking a mechanism tumors use to camouflage themselves from the immune system, allowing it to recognize and attack the cancer. The FDA approved Keytruda last year to treat advanced melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, making it the first drug from the PD-1 class to reach the U.S. market. Rival drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said on Sunday an independent data monitoring committee concluded that a late-stage study evaluating its skin-cancer drug Opdivo in previously treated patients with advanced, squamous cell non-small-cell lung cancer met its main goal.

727,MRK,Exclusive: Merck funds tests of lower Zilmax doses as seen seeking way to resume sales,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc is funding the testing of lower dosages of its controversial cattle growth drug Zilmax, in a move that livestock experts say is crucial if the company is to resume sales of the product to the U.S. beef industry. Nearly 18 months after Merck pulled the drug from the U.S. and Canadian markets after videos and photographs surfaced showing Zilmax-fed cattle turning up in a distressed state, either lame or with hooves missing at slaughterhouses, scientists at Texas Tech University are testing beef carcasses taken from cattle fed different concentrations of Zilmax. The Merck-funded field study and lab work, which have not previously been reported, are designed to test Zilmax at its currently approved dosage of 6.8 grams per ton of feed for a 20-day period prior to slaughter, as well as dosages at about 60 percent and nearly 80 percent of that level, according to the title of the study. At the time Merck pulled Zilmax off the market, it had only one dosage level approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Merck awarded $1.85 million to the Texas Tech team in October to conduct the research, the university mentioned at the time in a newsletter that got little attention outside of the school. The research is ongoing and the specific time frame of the study was not clear.  “This study is an example of the company’s ongoing research efforts to provide additional data on the use of Zilmax,” the company said in a statement to Reuters. Merck, which says it still sells Zilmax in Mexico and South Africa, declined to comment on why it was testing these particular levels or whether it was collecting data to submit to the FDA. Merck also declined to say how many cattle are being fed Zilmax as part of the tests, or where the animals are being raised or slaughtered. It declined to give any further details. An FDA spokeswoman declined to comment on the study, citing confidentiality regarding drug applications.  Texas Tech did not respond to requests for comment.  In November, federal regulators approved changes proposed by the company in the way the drug is administered. The company has also been working with cattle feed lot operators on how best to administer the drug. “It looks to me like they’re doing studies to determine if the lower dosages are efficacious in improving feed efficiency, growth rate and carcass leanness,” said David Anderson, former head of swine research at Elanco Animal Health, a unit of Merck rival Eli Lily & Co, when Reuters told him about the study. A similar product called Optaflexx, made by Elanco “has captured the market,” said Arizona cattle rancher Harvey Dietrich, co-founder of advocacy group Beef Additive Alert, which is critical of growth-promotants such as Zilmax. “Merck wants their market share back,” he added. At the time the videos of the distressed cattle surfaced in 2013, some veterinarians argued that a key problem was that the drug, at its approved dosage, was too potent for some animals.   The drug company does not need federal approval to return Zilmax to the market. But all four of the nation’s largest beef packers and many meat producers have told Reuters they won’t accept Zilmax until Merck can scientifically prove the drug doesn’t cause the animal welfare issues seen in the past. One option, say industry experts, would be for Merck to show the FDA that Zilmax is effective and safe at helping cattle gain weight at lower dosages, and petition the agency to alter the product’s usage label. The multi-site study that Merck is funding could provide the data needed to make such a petition, according to industry experts. Current labeling covers both dosage and details about its effectiveness on cattle.     Major meat packers like Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] and Tyson Foods Inc say they are not processing any meat from Merck’s study or slaughtering cattle fed with Zilmax. Spokesmen for Cargill, Tyson, National Beef Packing Co [NBEEF.UL] and JBS USA [JBS.UL] said their companies were not participating in the study.

728,MRK,Johnson & Johnson's forex warning a sign for rival drugmakers,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) surprised investors by detailing the degree to which a strong dollar will hurt sales abroad this year, and industry watchers say Wall Street is underestimating the likely hit to other U.S.-based rivals such as Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Merck & Co (MRK.N). J&J;, the first large U.S. drugmaker to report fourth-quarter results, on Tuesday said sales fell 0.6 percent to $18.25 billion, but would have risen 3.9 percent if not for the stronger dollar. The 4.5 percent foreign exchange hit compared with an average 0.9 percent headwind in the first three quarters of the year.  The diversified healthcare company now expects a foreign currency hit to earnings in 2015 of as much as 42 cents per share, versus the 15 cents to 20 cents it forecast in October. “Foreign exchange will be a focal point for the whole drug group” in the fourth quarter and 2015, said John Boris, an analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey. He predicted the stronger dollar will take a bigger bite out of other drugmakers’ earnings than many expect, and said Pfizer and Merck are among the most vulnerable because they both derive more than 60 percent of their sales outside the United States. A spokeswoman for Pfizer declined to comment, saying the company will discuss the impact of foreign exchange when it reports quarterly results on Jan 27. Merck officials could not immediately be reached for comment. J&J; shares fell 2.6 percent on Tuesday, while the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index .DRG of U.S. and European drugmakers was little changed.  “The market today is very much focused on J&J;, but companies like J&J; with a big global footprint are also at risk,” said Atlantic Equities analyst Richard Purkiss, who cited Pfizer as among the most vulnerable. Indianapolis drugmaker Eli Lilly (LLY.N) said earlier this month it expects foreign exchange “headwinds” in 2015, but would not give details until it reports quarterly earnings on Jan. 30. Almost 55 percent of its sales are from outside the United States. The dollar .DXY gained nearly 13 percent against a basket of major currencies in 2014, its strongest performance since 1997. For U.S.-based companies, the stronger dollar hurts the value of sales in overseas markets.  Boris said sales of innovative new drugs from J&J; and rival drugmakers - such as treatments for cancer, diabetes and hepatitis C - could still mitigate the foreign currency impact and help them deliver double-digit industry earnings growth over the next five years.

731,MRK,"RPT-INSIGHT-US companies face billions in Venezuela currency losses, Reuters analysis shows","(Repeating to additional subscribers) By Tim McLaughlin Feb 2 (Reuters) - At least 40 major U.S. companies have substantial exposure to Venezuela’s deepening economic crisis, and could collectively be forced to take billions of dollars of write downs, a Reuters analysis shows. The companies, all members of the S&P; 500, and including some of the biggest names in Corporate America such as autos giant General Motors and drug maker Merck & Co Inc , together carry at least $11 billion of monetary assets in the Venezuelan currency, the bolivar, on their books. The official rate is at 6.3 bolivars to the dollar and there are two other rates in the government system - known as SICAD 1 and SICAD 2 - at about 12 and 50. The black market rate, though, was at about 190 bolivars to the dollar on Sunday, according to the website dolartoday.com. The problem is that the dollar value of the assets as disclosed in many of the companies’ accounts is based on either the rates at 6.3 or 12 and only a limited number of transactions are allowed at those rates. The assets would be worth a lot fewer dollars at the 50 rate in the government system and the dollar value would almost be wiped out at the black market rate. The currency system is also about to be shaken up following an announcement by Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro on Jan. 21, leading to fears of a further devaluation. American companies will also have additional exposure to the bolivar that isn’t disclosed because they don’t see the size of that exposure as material to their results. The Reuters analysis also doesn’t look at the thousands of publicly traded and private American companies that aren’t in the S&P; 500 and will in some cases have bolivar assets. Some leading American companies have already decided that the stronger exchange rates - the official rate at 6.3 and the SICAD 1 exchange market at 12 - are not reflective of the currency conditions they face in the South American country. Diaper and tissue maker Kimberly-Clark Corp recently announced a charge of $462 million for its Venezuelan business, leading to a fourth-quarter loss for the company, after it concluded that the appropriate exchange rate was the SICAD 2 exchange rate at 50 rather than the 6.3 it had previously used. Using the stronger exchange rates is unrealistic because of how hard it is to repatriate profits earned in Venezuela back to the United States at any rate, let alone those rates, securities analysts say. Citigroup Inc says it has not been able to buy U.S. dollars from the Venezuelan government since 2008. Companies can seek dollars at the official rate if they are using those dollars to import raw materials for production of priority goods such as food and medicine, and some can buy dollars at the SICAD 1 rate at around 12 bolivars to the dollar through auctions that are typically held several times per month but are only targeted at specific sectors. As tumbling oil prices have left Venezuela with fewer dollars, its currency board has steadily reduced approval for repatriation of dividends at the official rate - leaving companies with growing quantities of bolivars trapped by currency controls. “It’s a huge deal and companies will get hit big,” said Ali Dibadji, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co Inc. “Take a look at what Kimberly-Clark did last week and what Clorox did a few months ago by getting out of Venezuela.” Cleaning and household products maker Clorox last year decided to exit Venezuela altogether. Its CEO Don Knauss said at the time: “We saw no hope that we could create a sustaining business in that country.” The currency issues are hurting many U.S. companies much more than their sales might suggest. Many of the companies in the analysis have been getting between 1-3 percent of their global revenue from Venezuela. Ford Motor Co and oil services company Schlumberger NV   took big-ticket hits to their quarterly profits because of their Venezuelan operations. Ford took a fourth-quarter charge of $800 million and Schlumberger $472 million. A Ford spokeswoman said that it still values its Venezuela assets at about 12 bolivars per US dollar. But for Ford, the currency system and other conditions are so tough in the South American country that it has made an accounting change that will allow it to ring fence its Venezuela business so that it doesn’t have a direct impact on the company’s operating results. Schlumberger, which previously used the 6.3 rate, said it is now using the SICAD 2 rate of 50 as it “best represents the economics of Schlumberger’s business activity in Venezuela.” Another S&P; 500 company to switch to the 50 rate from 6.3 in recent weeks was industrial gases producer Praxair Inc, which took a fourth-quarter charge of $131 million as a result. It also said the switch will hurt its revenue and earnings in 2015. Those changes don’t reflect the prospect of another currency devaluation in Venezuela, as recently telegraphed by Maduro, who is struggling to keep a lid on consumer prices amid a 64 percent inflation rate and a plunge in oil revenue. The official rate was last devalued by 32 percent to the current 6.3 from 4.3 in February 2013, at that time the fifth devaluation in a decade. Maduro said in the Jan 21 announcement he would merge the two existing SICAD rates (the ones at 12 and 50 per U.S. dollar). He also would introduce another new rate to offer dollars via private brokers to vie with the black market rate. There has yet to be a further announcement providing details of the new system and the rates. Currency uncertainties aside, foreign companies face a myriad of other problems in Venezuela, from weak demand to shortages of many goods, difficulty in importing parts and products, and relying on the government to approve price increases to keep pace with hyperinflation. Most of the S&P; 500 bolivar exposure is concentrated among 10 companies that have disclosed about $7.3 billion in assets linked to the country’s currency system, according to the Reuters analysis of their latest quarterly financial statements. But if those companies used Venezuela’s SICAD 2 currency rate, the one at about 50 bolivars to the dollar, their assets would decline by as much as $5.8 billion. All of these companies currently either use the rates at 6.3 and 12. It would be far worse if they used Venezuela’s black market rate of about 190 for the currency. The companies’ bolivar assets would be worth only a tiny fraction of their current estimated value if they used that rate. GM, which ranked No. 1 out of the group analyzed, with $1.5 billion in Venezuela exposure, said it is closely monitoring conditions there. “We have nothing to announce at this time,” spokesman Tom Henderson said. Some U.S. companies, such as Merck, justify valuing their Venezuela assets at the most preferential rate because they are providing essential services and goods, like medicine, to the country. They report some success in translating bolivars into dollars at the 6.3 rate. Merck did not respond to a message seeking comment. Still, some of these same companies have prepared their investors for a currency hit in their latest round of quarterly disclosures. PepsiCo Inc said it would take an after-tax charge of up to $440 million if it revalued its Venezuela assets at the 50 rate. As of early September, the company disclosed $505 million in bolivar-denominated net monetary assets. “I do think that more companies may consider exiting Venezuela if the inability to remove cash or take prices to offset devaluations persist,” said Dibadji, the Sanford Bernstein analyst.

Still, some of these same companies have prepared their investors for a currency hit in their latest round of quarterly disclosures. PepsiCo Inc said it would take an after-tax charge of up to $440 million if it revalued its Venezuela assets at the 50 rate. As of early September, the company disclosed $505 million in bolivar-denominated net monetary assets. “I do think that more companies may consider exiting Venezuela if the inability to remove cash or take prices to offset devaluations persist,” said Dibadji, the Sanford Bernstein analyst.

The benchmark index added to losses late in the session after the European Central Bank abruptly cancelled its acceptance of Greek bonds in return for funding. The move means the Greek central bank will have to provide its banks with tens of billions of euros of additional emergency liquidity in coming weeks. “It’s kind of reconfirming what we’ve thought for a while, which is that there is going to be a liquidity crunch if they don’t resolve this Greek situation,” said Larry Peruzzi, senior equity trader at Cabrera Capital Markets Inc in Boston. “They make a little bit of progress and then they kind of fall back.” Shares of the Global X FTSE Greece 20 exchange-traded fund  dropped 10.4 percent, with volume spiking late in the session. The euro also fell on the news, while the S&P; financial index turned lower and ended down 0.3 percent. The Dow ended in positive territory, lifted by shares of Walt Disney, up 8 percent to $101.64 after quarterly profit topped analysts’ expectations. The S&P; 500 energy index was off 1.6 percent as oil prices declined after a four-day surge of nearly 20 percent. U.S. crude sank 8.7 percent to settle at $48.45 following a new build in U.S. crude stockpiles. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 6.62 points, or 0.04 percent, to 17,673.02, the S&P; 500 lost 8.52 points, or 0.42 percent, to 2,041.51 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 11.04 points, or 0.23 percent, to 4,716.70. The day’s dip followed a two-day gain of 2.8 percent for the S&P; 500, driven largely by the rebound in energy shares. Big biotechnology names declined. Leading them lower was Gilead Sciences, whose stock dropped 8.2 percent to $98.43, a day after the drugmaker said it is offering steeper-than-expected discounts on its hepatitis C drugs. The news fueled concerns the sector would face increasing price pressure. The Nasdaq Biotech Index was down 1.8 percent. Gilead was also the biggest drag on the S&P; 500 and Nasdaq. About 7.8 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 8.1 billion average for the last five sessions, according to BATS Global Markets.

735,MRK,"Merck says hepatitis C treatment to lose ""breakthrough"" status","(Reuters) - Merck & Co on Wednesday said U.S. regulators intend to rescind the “breakthrough therapy” designation for its  combination treatment for hepatitis C because other new drugs are available, a decision that could delay approval of the Merck product by several months. The Food and Drug Administration gives the designation to medicines it deems likely to demonstrate “substantial improvement” over existing drugs. The designation has hastened approval of some drugs by two to three months.  Analysts said Merck’s two-drug treatment would likely now require a standard 10-month review. Merck, in its fourth-quarter earnings report, said it plans to discuss the matter with the FDA and still expects to seek U.S. approval in the first half of 2015. The treatment consists of a protease inhibitor called MK-5172 and a so-called NS5A inhibitor called MK-8742 that together had received the FDA’s “breakthrough therapy” designation.  In a recent mid-stage trial, Merck’s combo cured 98 percent of previously untreated patients with genotype 1, the most common and hardest to treat variant of hepatitis C. Merck said late-stage trials are now complete, and will support approval. “Based upon data today, we believe we will be able to compete in the marketplace,” Adam Schechter, head of global human health for Merck, said in an interview.The setback for Merck follows recent approvals of costly oral treatments for the liver disease from Gilead Sciences Inc and AbbVie Inc that have wiped out all signs of the virus in well over 90 percent of patients after eight or 12 weeks. “The breakthrough therapy designation is meant for drugs that address an unmet medical need, but we now have two virtual cures for hepatitis C on the market” from Gilead and AbbVie, said Edward Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans. Evans said Merck’s combination treatment will likely undergo a standard FDA review. She predicted, however, that Merck’s array of experimental hepatitis C drugs will eventually claim a 15 to 20 percent global market share, with annual sales in the billions of dollars. Shares of the second-biggest U.S. drugmaker fell 3.5 percent on Wednesday, also hurt by a weaker-than-expected profit forecast for 2015 which the company blamed on the stronger dollar.  In the face of such potent rival hepatitis C medicines, Merck in June announced it would ramp up its involvement in the lucrative field by buying Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc for $3.85 billion and combining the two companies’ most promising drugs to produce a faster, more effective cure.           Idenix had three hepatitis C drugs in development, most notably a pill in early-stage trials called IDX21437, which Merck has renamed MK-3682. Like Gilead’s Sovaldi, it is a nucleotide inhibitor, or “nuc,” that blocks a protein needed by the hepatitis C virus to replicate. Merck is conducting a mid-stage trial to study combinations of MK-3682 and MK-5172 (grazoprevir) with either MK-8742 (elbasvir) or another drug called MK-8408. It hopes to begin larger late-stage trials of the triplet therapies this year. Gilead introduced Sovaldi in late 2013 at a cost of $1,000 a pill, and reported fourth-quarter sales of $1.73 billion for the drug. Gilead later introduced Harvoni, a pill combining Sovaldi with another treatment, and it captured sales of $2.11 billion in the quarter. AbbVie launched its Viekira Pak treatment late last year. Since then, it has battled Gilead for market share by offering discounts to insurers and other group payers. Late on Tuesday, Gilead disclosed that its discounts will average 46 percent this year, up sharply from analyst expectations of 25 to 30 percent. Shares of Gilead and AbbVie both tumbled after the news. As many as 3.2 million people in the United States are estimated to be infected with the hepatitis C virus, which can lead to severe liver disease. Merck on Wednesday reported slightly disappointing fourth-quarter sales and predicted 2015 earnings below analyst forecasts. It cited the negative impact of the stronger dollar, as most of its U.S. rivals have done in their own cautious forecasts.

742,MRK,"Merck issues cautious 2015 forecast, citing dollar","Feb 4 (Reuters) - Merck & Co on Wednesday reported slightly disappointing fourth quarter sales and predicted 2015 earnings below analyst forecasts, citing the negative impact of the stronger dollar, as most of its U.S. rivals have done in making their own cautious forecasts. Merck said it expects full-year 2015 earnings of $3.32 to $3.47 per share, excluding special items, with foreign exchange factors crimping earnings by 27 cents per share. Wall Street had predicted $3.49 per share. The second-biggest U.S. drugmaker on Wednesday said it earned $7.32 billion, or $2.54 per share, in the fourth quarter. That compared with $781 million, or 26 cents per share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding special items, the company earned 87 cents per share. Analysts, on average, expected 85 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Company revenue of $10.48 billion trailed Wall Street expectations of $10.5 billion, held back by lower sales of its Remicade arthritis drug, now facing competition from cheaper generics.

746,MRK,Biosimilar copies of blockbuster drug launch in major EU markets,"* Biosimilars launched by Celltrion, Hospira and Mundipharma * New products are copies of J&J; and Merck’s Remicade * Biosimilars expected to disrupt market for biotech medicines By Ben Hirschler LONDON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Cheap versions of a top-selling drug for rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease are being launched across major European markets in an important advance for a new type of medicines known as biosimilars. The products from South Korean firm Celltrion  and its partners Hospira and Mundipharma will compete with Remicade, the original branded drug from Johnson & Johnson  and Merck & Co. The potential of biosimilars to grab substantial business from original brands was a key factor behind Pfizer’s  decision this month to buy Hospira for about $15 billion. Unlisted Mundipharma said on Wednesday that it is launching its biosimilar Remsima in Germany, Italy, Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, following expiry of  relevant Remicade patents. Hospira is to sell its product Inflectra in markets including Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden. Copies of Remicade have been on sale for several months in some smaller European markets, such as Norway, but the move into major economies is a big step forward for products that could disrupt the multibillion-dollar biotechnology industry. Because biotech drugs are made from living cells it is impossible to manufacture exact copies, as happens with simple chemical medicines, so regulators have come up with the notion of approving products that are similar enough to do the job. Remicade, which has annual European sales of about 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion), and the two biosimilar copies all contain an antibody known as infliximab. There has been a fierce debate for many years on how rapidly biosimilars will be adopted by doctors and the take-up of Remsima and Inflectra in the likes of Germany, France and Britain will be an important test. Many more biosimilar copies of drugs for diseases ranging from cancer to eye disorders are now in development, posing a threat to leading biotech drugmakers such as Roche and AbbVie. Citigroup analyst Andrew Baum predicted this month that biosimilars would result in at least $110 billion of value being transferred from innovator companies to copycat producers between 2015 and 2025. The upside for society is that they could generate an estimated $50 billion in savings for healthcare systems, Citi says. Jorgen Jahnsen, professor of medicine and gastroenterology at the University of Oslo, said that in Norway the use of biosimilar infliximab had already enabled the healthcare system to make considerable savings. Another test for biosimilars is looming in the United States, where a Food and Drug Administration advisory committee will decide on March 17 whether to recommend Celltrion’s biosimilar version of Remicade.

747,MRK,Guinea to start final trials of Ebola vaccines this week,"LONDON/GENEVA (Reuters) - Final stage trials of an Ebola vaccine being developed by Merck and NewLink Genetics will begin in Guinea on March 7, the World Health Organization said on Thursday. Signaling global health authorities’ determination to see through trials despite a sharp drop in cases in the West Africa epidemic, the WHO said a second shot, developed by GlaxoSmithKline will be tested “in a sequential study, as supply becomes available”. More than 23,900 confirmed and suspected cases of Ebola have been reported since the outbreak began in December 2013, including some 9,800 deaths. Nearly 500 health workers have been among the dead in what is the worst ever Ebola epidemic. All three worst-hit countries - Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone - aim to conduct final-stage trials of vaccines, and Liberia is already testing the GlaxoSmithKline and Merck-NewLink shots, while Sierra Leone is expected to announce plans soon. But recent steep declines in new Ebola cases will make it far harder to prove whether experimental vaccines work, as the vaccine’s effect will be difficult to establish. The WHO, however, said it was committed to pushing ahead. “The Ebola epidemic shows signs of receding but we cannot let down our guard until we reach zero cases,” said Marie-Paule Kieny, head of the WHO’s Ebola research and development effort. “An effective vaccine to control current flare-ups could be the game-changer to finally end this epidemic and an insurance policy for any future ones.” The trial in the Basse Guinée region, which has Guinea’s most cases, will use a “ring vaccination” strategy similar to that used to eradicate smallpox in the 1970s. This involves vaccinating everyone who has been in contact with a newly diagnosed person or “index” case.  “Testing investigational medicines during an epidemic is incredibly challenging, but this approach gives us the best possible chance of finding a safe and effective vaccine in time to save lives,” said Jeremy Farrar, director of Wellcome Trust, the medical charity that has led the push for Ebola vaccines. In Liberia, where no new cases have been reported for 13 days, the government says the trial is a “resounding success”.  But local media has reported that some residents are refusing measles and polio vaccinations amid rumors of a deliberate plot to infect them with Ebola.

756,MRK,Fitch Downgrades Merck's L-T IDR to 'A'; Outlook Revised to Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 13 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has downgraded Merck & Co.'s (Merck)  long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) by one notch to 'A' and revised the Rating  Outlook to Stable from Negative. In addition, the company's short-term IDR has  been affirmed at 'F1'. Merck had $21.7 billion in outstanding debt at Dec. 31, 2014. A full list of  Fitch's ratings actions follows at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS --Fitch expects MRK's leverage (total debt/EBITDA) to remain above 1.7x for the  next several years, a level consistent with an 'A' rating given the company's  scale and strong industry position.    --Fitch believes Merck will pursue targeted acquisitions as opposed to large  transformative ones. An improving pipeline and narrowing strategic focus reduces  the need to do big deals, as evidenced by the recent acquisition of Cubicin  Pharmaceuticals (Cubist).  --Fitch expects Merck will continue to favor share repurchases over  deleveraging, with the possibility of further debt-funded stock buybacks being  an overhang on the credit profile. The company has roughly $11.7 billion  remaining on its existing repurchase authorizations as of March 24, 2015. --Sales at risk to patent expiries through 2017 are roughly 23% of 2014  revenues. About one-quarter of those sales are generated by biologics, which  tend have significantly less market share erosion upon patent expiration than do  traditional small-molecule drugs. --Merck continues to make progress in building its late-stage pipeline, with  approximately 17 new molecular entities (NMEs) in phase 3 development or  registration. --Januvia/Janumet, Merck's largest prescription drug franchise, continued to  post low single-digit growth during 2014, despite ongoing competitive headwinds  in the diabetes treatment market.  --Fitch forecasts that Merck will generate $3.7 billion-$3.8 billion in free  cash flow (FCF)/(cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures minus  dividends) during 2015 as improving margins offset soft revenue. Aggressive Capital Deployment Drives Downgrade: Fitch believes that Merck's  operating outlook is favorable. This includes an improving drug development  pipeline, recently good results in securing FDA approvals for new therapeutic  products, and a manageable percentage of sales at risk to near-term patent  expiration.  Higher leverage (total debt-to-EBITDA of 1.8x pro forma for the Cubist  acquisition versus 1x in 2011) is partly the result of the effects of the U.S.  branded-drug patent cliff on the company's top line and EBITDA in 2012-2013.  However, the company has not prioritized deleveraging as the business profile  has recovered, instead choosing to be aggressive in returning cash to  shareholders.  Cubist Acquistion Expands Presence in Hospital Setting: Merck's January 2015  $8.4 billion acquisition of Cubist plus roughly $1.1 billion in net debt expands  its presence in the anti-infective market, particularly in the hospital setting.  The transaction also adds two of Cubist's pipeline products, bevenopran  (opioid-induced constipation) and surotomycin (clostridium difficile), to  Merck's drug development efforts. The acquisition was largely funded with $8  billion in new debt, which Merck issued in February 2015.  The Cubist acquisition is an example of the types of targeted acquisitions that  Fitch believes Merck will continue to pursue. A large, transformational type of  transaction is relatively less likely given the company's favorable operating  outlook.  Diabetes Franchise Growth Continues: Combined sales of Januvia and Janumet  continued to grow during 2014 by roughly 3% year-over-year. Favorable clinical  data, a growing number of diabetic patients, and investment in the franchise has  helped to support the underlying growth in sales. The positive trend has  occurred despite increasing competition from other recently introduced branded  pharmaceuticals within the diabetes market.  Patent Exposure Manageable: The company faces a significant number of patent  expiries during the next two years, but Fitch views the risk as manageable as  roughly only 23% of total firm sales are at risk. In addition, Remicade, which  accounts for about 5.6% of total firm sales, is a biologic that will probably  experience less rapid sales losses to generic competition compared to  traditional small-molecule pharmaceuticals. Expanding Late-Stage Pipeline: Fitch expects Merck to continue to build its  late-stage pipeline with NMEs to treat cancers, bacterial and viral infections,  diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, central nervous afflictions, osteoporosis  and allergies.  While most of these projects are internally developed, Merck has partnered with  other innovator firms to take advantage of technological advancements that were  discovered and cultivated externally. The landscape for drug development is  expanding, particularly as more is learned about how genetics influence the  development, prevention and treatment of disease. As such, Fitch believes that  it is a responsibility, and strategically advantageous, for firms to look  externally as well as internally regarding new drug development. Share Repurchases to Continue: Fitch forecasts continued shareholder-friendly  actions during the near term, some of which may be funded by debt. Merck has  occasionally funded its share repurchases with debt. During 2014, the company  purchased a net $6.1 billion of its common stock, compared to $5.3 billion  during the prior LTM period.  On March 24, 2015, Merck announced its board authorized an additional $10  billion share repurchase program and stated that it had $1.7 billion remaining  on a May 2013 program. Positive FCF Expected: Fitch forecasts that Merck will continue to generate $3.7  billion-$3.8 billion in FCF (cash flow from operations of $10.3 billion minus  capital expenditures of $1.2 billion minus dividends of $5.4 billion) during  2015. Improving margins driven by sales mix and strong cost control efforts  should more than offset expected soft top-line growth.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Merck include: -- Declining revenue, driven by weak utilization in developed markets, the  divestiture of the consumer business and foreign exchange headwinds. Somewhat  offsetting the decline are relatively stronger demand in emerging markets, a  moderating patent cliff and incremental revenue from pipeline commercialization.  --Margin improvement driven by a focus on costs and an improving sales mix  benefiting from the divestiture of the lower margin consumer health business. --Annual FCF (cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures minus  dividends) of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion during 2015. --Targeted acquisitions with no strategic, transformative transactions. --Continued significant capital deployment to share repurchases. --Leverage to range between 1.8x-2x during the next two years driven by an  additional $8 billion in debt issued in February 2015 to fund the Cubist  acquisition.  LIQUIDITY Fitch expects Merck to maintain adequate liquidity through strong FCF generation  and ample access to the credit markets. FCF for the LTM ending Dec. 31, 2014 was  $1.3 billion. At the end of the period, Merck had approximately $15.7 billion in  cash/short-term investments (U.S.: 10%-20% of total balances/OUS: 80%-90% of  total balances) and full availability on its $6 billion revolver, maturing in  August 2019.  At Dec. 31, 2014, Merck had roughly $21.7 billion in debt outstanding, although  the company issued an additional $8 billion in debt in February 2015. After the  issuance the company had roughly $30.5 billion in debt outstanding, with $2.7  billion maturing in 2015, $2.4 billion in 2016, $0.3 billion in 2017 and $3  billion in 2018. Fitch expects near- to mid-term maturities will be satisfied  primarily through refinancing in the public debt markets. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include the following: --Improving operations including new product development that support long-term  positive revenue growth and margin stability/increases; --An operational profile that would consitently generate significantly positive  FCF; --Cash deployment strategy that maintains gross debt leverage below 1.7x,  including managing through operational stress such as patent expiries. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include the following: --Material and lasting deterioration in operations and FCF, possibly driven by  patent expiries not being offset by new product development; --Leveraging acquisitions without the prospect of timely debt/leverage  reduction; --Persistent leverage above 2.2x. RATING ACTIONS Fitch has downgraded Merck's ratings as follows:   --Long-term IDR to 'A' from 'A+';  --Senior unsecured debt rating to 'A' from 'A+'; --Bank loan rating to 'A' from 'A+'.

759,MRK,"Merck's Keytruda shrinks lung cancer tumors, FDA approval sought","(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc’s Keytruda, approved for treating melanoma, was shown in a trial to shrink tumors in nearly half of advanced lung cancer patients with high levels of a protein used by tumors to evade the body’s own disease-fighting cells. The company said it has filed for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of the drug as a treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease has worsened despite previous treatment. Keytruda, also known as pembrolizumab, belongs to a new class of drugs designed to help the immune system fend off cancer by blocking a protein known as Programmed Death receptor (PD-1), or a related target known as PD-L1. On Friday, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said a trial of its PD-1 inhibitor, Opdivo, was stopped early after the drug proved to work better than chemotherapy in previously treated patients with non-squamous NSCLC. Opdivo is already approved for treating the less-common squamous NSCLC, as well as metastatic melanoma.  Merck said its FDA lung cancer filing is for patients with both squamous and non-squamous NSCLC. Lung cancer, which kills nearly 160,000 Americans annually, is seen as the biggest opportunity for the PD-1 drugs, which analysts expect to reach billions of dollars in sales. Merck’s Phase 1 study of 495 patients with NSCLC, the most common form of the disease, found that 45 percent of patients with high levels of PD-L1 responded to Keytruda, compared with 16.5 percent of patients with PD-L1 levels of 1 percent to 49 percent. For patients with PD-L1 below 1 percent, the response rate - defined as tumor shrinkage of at least 30 percent - was 10.7 percent. Researchers said about a quarter of trial patients had PD-L1 expression in at least half of their tumor cells. Overall, 19 percent of trial patients responded to the drug.  Side effects of Keytruda included thyroid problems. One patient died from pneumonitis, or lung inflammation, which was seen in 3.6 percent of trial patients. The Merck results were presented at a meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research and published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Researchers also presented results from a trial showing that Keytruda improved the length of time before advanced skin cancer worsened by 42 percent and extended patient survival by 34 percent compared with treatment with ipilimumab, a different immunotherapy sold by Bristol-Myers under the brand name Yervoy.

763,MRK,Merck oral hepatitis C regimen shows 95 pct cure rate,"April 24 (Reuters) - Merck and Co Inc presented trial results on Friday showing that a once-daily combination of two experimental pills cured 95 percent of previously untreated hepatitis C patients after 12 weeks. The trial included patients infected with the most common form of the liver-destroying virus, genotype 1, along with less common genotypes 4 and 6. It also involved patients with and without liver cirrhosis. Cure rates, defined as sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment, were 92 percent for patients with genotype 1a; 99 percent for genotype 1b; 100 percent for genotype 4; and 80 percent for genotype 6. Cures were achieved in 97 percent of cirrhotic patients and 94 percent of non-cirrhotic patients. Gilead Sciences Inc’s Harvoni, currently the only hepatitis C drug that does not need to be taken with antiviral pill ribavirin, is approved only for genotype 1 patients, which account for about 70 percent of U.S. infections. “We have a really high efficacy regimen in a single tablet without ribavirin,” said Eliav Barr, Merck’s vice president, infectious diseases. “Current data that have been out there have really focused on a standard population for HCV.” Merck said it still aims to submit an application for the grazoprevir/elbasvir regimen to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the first half of this year. The agency has granted Merck “breakthrough therapy” designation for the treatment in genotype 1 HCV patients with end stage renal disease who are on hemodialysis and for genotype 4 HCV patients. Results from the 412-patient trial were presented at a meeting of the European Association for the Study of the Liver in Vienna and published in Annals of Internal Medicine. Gilead secured an early lead in the lucrative market for oral hepatitis C drugs - first with Sovaldi, and now Harvoni, which has a list price of $94,500 for 12 weeks. AbbVie Inc  entered the market last year with a multi-pill regimen. Nevertheless, AbbVie secured exclusive contracts with payers such as pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co , forcing Gilead to discount its own contract prices. Hepatitis C infects an estimated 3.2 million Americans. “HCV is a huge population. There is going to be a need for a lot of players here to make sure we eliminate the disease,” Barr said. “We will have a really strong offering for patients, payers, and physicians.” ",4242015,http://www.reuters.com/article/merck-hepatitis-c/merck-oral-hepatitis-c-regimen-shows-95-pct-cure-rate-idUSL1N0XK23A20150424
764,MRK,UPDATE 2-Merck diabetes drug Januvia meets heart safety target,"(Adds analyst comment) By Bill Berkrot April 27 (Reuters) - Merck and Co’s diabetes drug Januvia achieved the main goal of a long-awaited heart safety study, according to preliminary results released by the drugmaker on Monday, likely removing a cloud of uncertainty from its biggest product. Merck shares rose nearly 4 percent in after-hours trading following the announcement. Januvia had sales of about $4 billion in 2014, plus another $1.8 billion for the related combination product Janumet. The Tecos study involved 14,724 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of heart disease. Januvia plus regular care led to no significant difference in a composite of time to the first cardiovascular-related death, non-fatal heart attack, non-fatal stroke, or unstable angina requiring hospitalization compared with usual care alone, Merck said. Significantly, among the secondary goals of the study, there was no increase in hospitalization for heart failure in the Januvia group versus placebo, Merck said. That could give Januvia a leg up on rival drugs that have shown a potential heart failure connection. Full details of the study are expected to be presented at a major diabetes meeting in Boston in June, the company said. Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said uncertainty over the Tecos study had been an overhang on Merck shares. With Monday’s initial results, “a psychological overhang has been removed and the threat of major downside has been eliminated,” Anderson said in a research note. Earlier this month, a panel of expert advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration voted that two similar diabetes drugs, AstraZeneca Plc’s Onglyza and Nesina from Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd, had acceptable cardiovascular risk profiles. However, they recommended that product information labels warn about the risk of heart failure. The two rival medicines and Januvia belong to a class of diabetes treatments known as DPP-4 inhibitors. The Tecos heart safety study was conducted by an independent academic research collaboration between the University of Oxford Diabetes Trials Unit and the Duke University Clinical Research Institute. It was undertaken after heart safety concerns were raised over other diabetes medicines. Merck shares rose as much as 3.8 percent to $59.25 in extended trading from their New York Stock Exchange close at $57.10.

767,MRK,Strong Merck cancer drug sales upstage rival Bristol-Myers,"April 28 (Reuters) - Investors betting that Bristol-Myers Squibb will emerge as the leading player in a hot new class of cancer drugs hit the pause button on Tuesday as a rival therapy from Merck & Co showed much higher sales. Bristol shares fell as much as 2.7 percent and closed off 1 percent after reporting sales of Opdivo, a therapy that helps the immune system fight cancer, totaled $40 million in the first quarter of the year. That was below Wall Street forecasts of $50 million. Merck said its Keytruda treatment had quarterly sales of $83 million, topping Wall Street estimates of about $70 million, helped by early compassionate use patients converting to paying customers following approval. “When investors saw Opdivo’s number was below Keytruda’s, that caused concern,” said John Boris, an analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey. Merck shares closed up 5 percent, though the gains were mostly attributed to positive new safety data on its top-selling Januvia diabetes treatment. Boris and other industry analysts said the early sales data represent only the first skirmish in a long battle for market share between Bristol-Myers and Merck. Some expect both drugs will eventually generate billions of dollars in annual sales, particularly if proven effective against other forms of cancer. In addition, excitement over Bristol-Myers’ cancer treatments have pushed shares to trade at 28.5 times expected 2016 per share earnings, Boris said. That compares with a multiple of 15.1 for Merck and 17.6 for the pharmaceutical sector. “Based on price per fundamentals, we like the value of Merck versus Bristol at the moment,” said Les Funtleyder, healthcare portfolio manager for ESquared Asset Management, which currently holds Merck but not Bristol shares. Ori Hershkovitz, a managing partner at Nexthera Capital in New York, said Bristol-Myers is trading more like a high-flying biotech. “The minute biotech gets pummeled, Bristol bears the brunt,” he said, noting biotech stocks have retreated sharply in recent weeks on fears they were overly inflated. Opdivo was approved in December to treat advanced melanoma. In March, it received clearance to treat a common form of lung cancer, giving Bristol an early-mover advantage in a much larger market. Keytruda has been approved for advanced melanoma since September and awaits regulatory approval in lung cancer. Both drugs work by blocking a protein called PD-1, helping the immune system recognize and destroy cancer cells. Roche Holding AG, AstraZeneca Plc and Pfizer Inc  are also developing similar treatments. Boris forecast Opdivo annual sales reaching $7 billion by 2020 and said Tuesday’s weakness in Bristol shares represents a buying opportunity. Opdivo has been shown to prolong survival in melanoma and lung cancer, according to clinical trial data. Keytruda has not yet demonstrated a survival benefit but is expected to do so in coming trials. Boris predicted it will capture annual sales of $3.7 billion by 2020. Bristol Chief Scientific Officer Francis Cuss told analysts on Tuesday that strong data on Opdivo along with the U.S. approvals in lung cancer and melanoma and expected European approval “really puts us in a very strong competitive position.” The company recently reported strong results from a combination of Opdivo and its older immunotherapy Yervoy in advanced melanoma. It plans to apply for approval of the combination therapy by mid-year. Merck head of global human health, Adam Schechter, told analysts that the market will be big enough to handle several competitors, “so I don’t think it should be looked at as one company versus the other.” Pfizer is racing to catch up with Merck and Bristol-Myers, by beginning late-stage trials this year of its PD-1 inhibitor and conducting trials of four other immuno-oncology drugs. PD-1 treatments “will be the workhorses for the foreseeable future, but they will need to be added to standard therapies or to (other) immuno-oncology treatments,” Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read said in an interview. “That’s where the market will be, and we will be well positioned with those combination agents.”     (Reporting by Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot, editing by Michele Gershberg and Andrew Hay)",4282015,http://www.reuters.com/article/bristolmyers-merck-cancer/strong-merck-cancer-drug-sales-upstage-rival-bristol-myers-idUSL1N0XP34H20150428

Data showing U.S. single-family home prices rose more than expected in February contributed to the afternoon rebound, although the data was released earlier in the session when some weak corporate results depressed U.S. shares. “The market, in between the earnings reports, is still always looking at the macro trends,” said Margaret Patel, senior portfolio manager at Wells Capital Management in Boston. “The housing numbers were very positive for the economy.” In Europe, however, disappointing corporate earnings handed shares their biggest daily decline in over a week, with paper maker UPM-Kymmene slipping after results while a new share issue hit Commerzbank. Oil prices seesawed as traders weighed security scares in the Middle East and support from a weak dollar against expectations that U.S. crude stockpiles have reached record highs. Iranian forces boarded a Marshall Islands-flagged cargo ship in the Gulf on Tuesday, the Pentagon said, an event which spurred a brief rally in oil prices. “Tensions are so high in that region with the impending Iran-U.S. nuclear deal that any event implied to be U.S.-linked has an immediate effect on oil prices,” said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital.

775,MRK,"Merck shares jump on strong earnings, Januvia safety data","(Reuters) - Merck & Co’s (MRK.N) shares jumped almost 5 percent after the U.S. drugmaker reported better-than-expected quarterly results and released favorable data late Monday about the safety of its Januvia diabetes drug. The second-largest U.S. drugmaker on Tuesday said it earned $953 million, or 33 cents per share, in the first quarter. That compared with $1.71 billion, or 57 cents per share, in the year earlier period. Excluding special items, Merck earned 85 cents per share, well above the average analyst estimate of 75 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company incurred significantly higher costs related to acquisitions and divestitures, while having smaller tax benefits than a year ago. Company sales fell 8 percent to $9.43 billion, but would have fallen only 3 percent if not for the stronger dollar. Sales topped Wall Street expectations of $9.07 billion, helped by hedging against foreign currency fluctuations. Despite its strong first-quarter results, Merck only slightly raised its 2015 earnings forecast, to between $3.35 and $3.48 per share, excluding special items. It had forecast earnings of $3.32 to $3.47 per share. Januvia sales rose 3 percent in the quarter to $884 million, while a related drug called Janumet rose 7 percent to $509 million. Late on Monday, Merck said Januvia achieved the main goal of a long-awaited heart safety study according to preliminary results, which likely removed a cloud of uncertainty from its biggest product. The Tecos study involved 14,724 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of heart disease. Januvia plus regular care led to no significant difference in a composite of time to the first cardiovascular-related death, non-fatal heart attack, non-fatal stroke, or unstable angina requiring hospitalization compared with usual care alone.  Significantly, there was no increase in hospitalization for heart failure in the Januvia group versus placebo. Analysts said that could give Januvia a leg up on rival drugs that have shown a potential heart failure connection. Sales of Merck’s animal health products rose 2 percent to $829 million, but would have risen 13 percent if not for the stronger dollar.  “Overall, a solid Q1 with raised guidance,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said of Merck’s report. Among large U.S. drugmakers, he said, only Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) have raised their 2015 forecasts. The two companies are leaders in immuno-oncology, drugs that harness the immune system to fight cancer.

IBM shares ticked up 1 percent to $172.46 and were the second biggest positive influence on the Dow after Merck. IBM hiked its quarterly dividend by 18 percent, its biggest increase in five years. Investors were also awaiting the results of a two-day Federal Reserve meeting that ends on Wednesday for clues on when the central bank will hike interest rates. Earlier in the session, a report said an Iranian “force” seized a U.S. cargo ship after opening fire on it in the Gulf, spurring a brief rally in oil prices. “We are on the lookout for that and that sort of geopolitical issue always drags the markets down and has certainly made people very nervous,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburg.

777,MRK,RPT-Strong Merck cancer drug sales upstage rival Bristol-Myers,"(Repeats Tuesday story with no changes to text.) By Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot April 28 (Reuters) - Investors betting that Bristol-Myers Squibb will emerge as the leading player in a hot new class of cancer drugs hit the pause button on Tuesday as a rival therapy from Merck & Co showed much higher sales. Bristol shares fell as much as 2.7 percent and closed off 1 percent after reporting sales of Opdivo, a therapy that helps the immune system fight cancer, totaled $40 million in the first quarter of the year. That was below Wall Street forecasts of $50 million. Merck said its Keytruda treatment had quarterly sales of $83 million, topping Wall Street estimates of about $70 million, helped by early compassionate use patients converting to paying customers following approval. “When investors saw Opdivo’s number was below Keytruda’s, that caused concern,” said John Boris, an analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey. Merck shares closed up 5 percent, though the gains were mostly attributed to positive new safety data on its top-selling Januvia diabetes treatment. Boris and other industry analysts said the early sales data represent only the first skirmish in a long battle for market share between Bristol-Myers and Merck. Some expect both drugs will eventually generate billions of dollars in annual sales, particularly if proven effective against other forms of cancer. In addition, excitement over Bristol-Myers’ cancer treatments have pushed shares to trade at 28.5 times expected 2016 per share earnings, Boris said. That compares with a multiple of 15.1 for Merck and 17.6 for the pharmaceutical sector. “Based on price per fundamentals, we like the value of Merck versus Bristol at the moment,” said Les Funtleyder, healthcare portfolio manager for ESquared Asset Management, which currently holds Merck but not Bristol shares. Ori Hershkovitz, a managing partner at Nexthera Capital in New York, said Bristol-Myers is trading more like a high-flying biotech. “The minute biotech gets pummeled, Bristol bears the brunt,” he said, noting biotech stocks have retreated sharply in recent weeks on fears they were overly inflated. Opdivo was approved in December to treat advanced melanoma. In March, it received clearance to treat a common form of lung cancer, giving Bristol an early-mover advantage in a much larger market. Keytruda has been approved for advanced melanoma since September and awaits regulatory approval in lung cancer. Both drugs work by blocking a protein called PD-1, helping the immune system recognize and destroy cancer cells. Roche Holding AG, AstraZeneca Plc and Pfizer Inc  are also developing similar treatments. Boris forecast Opdivo annual sales reaching $7 billion by 2020 and said Tuesday’s weakness in Bristol shares represents a buying opportunity. Opdivo has been shown to prolong survival in melanoma and lung cancer, according to clinical trial data. Keytruda has not yet demonstrated a survival benefit but is expected to do so in coming trials. Boris predicted it will capture annual sales of $3.7 billion by 2020. Bristol Chief Scientific Officer Francis Cuss told analysts on Tuesday that strong data on Opdivo along with the U.S. approvals in lung cancer and melanoma and expected European approval “really puts us in a very strong competitive position.” The company recently reported strong results from a combination of Opdivo and its older immunotherapy Yervoy in advanced melanoma. It plans to apply for approval of the combination therapy by mid-year. Merck head of global human health, Adam Schechter, told analysts that the market will be big enough to handle several competitors, “so I don’t think it should be looked at as one company versus the other.” Pfizer is racing to catch up with Merck and Bristol-Myers, by beginning late-stage trials this year of its PD-1 inhibitor and conducting trials of four other immuno-oncology drugs. PD-1 treatments “will be the workhorses for the foreseeable future, but they will need to be added to standard therapies or to (other) immuno-oncology treatments,” Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read said in an interview. “That’s where the market will be, and we will be well positioned with those combination agents.”     (Reporting by Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot, editing by Michele Gershberg and Andrew Hay)",4292015,http://www.reuters.com/article/bristolmyers-merck-cancer/rpt-strong-merck-cancer-drug-sales-upstage-rival-bristol-myers-idUSL1N0XP3O820150429

779,MRK,Indian court bars Glenmark from selling Merck drug copies,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India’s Supreme Court has barred Glenmark Pharmaceuticals from making and selling copies of U.S. drugmaker Merck’s diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet, according to a court document released on Friday. The court has, however, allowed Glenmark to continue to sell existing inventory, according to the document posted on the Supreme Court’s website after a hearing. The decision against Glenmark comes two years after Switzerland’s Novartis AG was denied patent protection for its cancer treatment Glivec in a landmark decision by India’s Supreme Court that was widely seen as boosting the local generic drugs industry. Anti-diabetes drugs are the top-selling therapy area in India, where about 65 million people live with the disease and that number is expected to reach 100 million by 2030. Merck sued Glenmark in 2013 for infringing a patent it has on sitagliptin, the chemical compound in Januvia and Janumet, both of which the company has been selling in India since 2008. A month’s dose of Merck’s drugs costs about 1,300 Indian rupees ($20) and 1,900 Indian rupees ($30), respectively. Merck has licensed the drugs to Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd for sale in India.

782,MRK,UPDATE 1-Indian court bars Glenmark from selling Merck drug copies,"(Adds details from court order) MUMBAI, May 15 (Reuters) - India’s Supreme Court has barred Glenmark Pharmaceuticals from making and selling copies of U.S. drugmaker Merck’s diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet, according to a court document released on Friday. The court has, however, allowed Glenmark to continue to sell existing inventory, according to the document posted on the Supreme Court’s website after a hearing. The decision against Glenmark comes two years after Switzerland’s Novartis AG was denied patent protection for its cancer treatment Glivec in a landmark decision by India’s Supreme Court that was widely seen as boosting the local generic drugs industry. Anti-diabetes drugs are the top-selling therapy area in India, where about 65 million people live with the disease and that number is expected to reach 100 million by 2030. Merck sued Glenmark in 2013 for infringing a patent it has on sitagliptin, the chemical compound in Januvia and Janumet, both of which the company has been selling in India since 2008. A month’s dose of Merck’s drugs costs about 1,300 Indian rupees ($20) and 1,900 Indian rupees ($30), respectively. Merck has licensed the drugs to Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd  for sale in India. Glenmark sells the medicines under the brand names Zita and Zita-met at a nearly 30 percent discount to Merck’s price.

784,MRK,"Brazil's JBS looking for deals in Americas, Australia: CEO","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Brazil’s JBS SA, the world’s largest meatpacker, this year will look at opportunities for acquisitions in North and South America and Australia, Chief Executive Wesley Batista said on Wednesday. Batista, in a wide-ranging interview with Reuters at a BMO investor conference in New York, also predicted that Zilmax, a controversial growth enhancer for cattle, will not return to market. Zilmax’s maker, Merck & Co, could not immediately be reached. Batista’s comments about the search for potential deals come after the company said in recent months that it was focused on organic growth, not on acquisitions. JBS will “for sure” be looking at potential acquisitions in the chicken, pork and branded, packaged food sectors during 2015, Batista said.  “I cannot say that, second half of this year, we are not going to be preparing ourselves, to (maybe) look something for late this year or next year,” he added. JBS in November struck a deal to buy Primo Group, a leading producer of ham, sausage and bacon in Australia and New Zealand, for A$1.45 billion ($1.25 billion) in a bid to increase its access to fast-growing Asian markets. Four months later, JBS’ director of investor relations, Jerry O’Callaghan, told analysts the company’s top priority for 2015 was to focus on organic growth. Last week, Batista said on a conference call that the company was open to deals but still “very focused on our current business.” “I’m more focused on some internal things, but this does not mean we are not going to be looking,” he said on Wednesday. Regarding Zilmax, Batista predicted the product will not return to use in U.S. beef production after Merck suspended sales in 2013. Major beef processors at the time stopped accepting cattle fed Zilmax following reports it may cause lameness. Merck has previously said Zilmax is safe and that it planned to resume sales after doing more tests. “It’s not going to happen,” Batista said about a return of Zilmax. Reuters reported in 2013 that packer Tyson Foods Inc had stopped taking Zilmax-fed livestock after more than two dozen animals that had been fed the drug arrived at one of its slaughterhouses with missing hooves. “The product was not a good fit for cattle production,” Batista said. “Everybody stopped. Some issues came about animal welfare and this kind of thing, and they just decided to stop. I don’t see this changing.” (This story has been corrected to change million to billion in paragraph 6) ",5212015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-jbs-acquistions-ceo/brazils-jbs-looking-for-deals-in-americas-australia-ceo-idUSKBN0O52VW20150521

789,MRK,"New drugs from Bristol, Merck at forefront of cancer meeting","(Reuters) - New data to be released this weekend should help deepen the understanding of how broadly new drugs that unleash the body’s immune system to fight cancer can be used. Results from key clinical trials will be presented starting Friday in Chicago at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. These will include studies aimed at defining ahead of time which patients are likely to benefit from the costly drugs.     At the forefront will be rival drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Merck and Co designed to block a protein known as Programmed Death receptor (PD-1) that is used by tumors to evade the body’s natural defenses. “It’s going to be an important meeting to get some more (details) on the PD-1 and PD-L1 drugs,” said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover.      Bristol’s Opdivo, or nivolumab, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December to treat advanced melanoma. In March, it also received clearance to treat a form of lung cancer, giving Bristol an early advantage in the much larger market. Merck’s Keytruda, or pembrolizumab, has been approved for advanced melanoma since September and is awaiting regulatory approval in lung cancer treatment.     First-quarter sales of both drugs surprised Wall Street, with Keytruda sales reaching $83 million, compared to $40 million for Opdivo, suggesting an early advantage for Merck in what many expect will be a years-long battle for market share.  Other drugmakers working on similar treatments include Roche Holding AG, AstraZeneca Plc and Pfizer Inc.  Many industry experts expect the entire class will eventually generate billions of dollars in annual sales, particularly if proven effective against other forms of cancer.     On Friday, the ASCO conference will feature studies looking at Opdivo’s use against advanced liver cancer and non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common form of lung cancer. Results will also be presented from a trial of Keytruda in head and neck cancer.     “Bristol’s in a really good position,” said Leerink Partners analyst Seamus Fernandez. “My expectation is that they’re going to be and will continue to be the leader in the lung cancer space.” Lung cancer, the most common cancer worldwide, is the largest cause of cancer deaths in the United States.      At the same time, he said, Merck may bolster its argument that Keytruda has proven the broadest possible use to date, with “clear activity in 13 different tumor types.” Other data points that will be closely watched by oncologists and investors include whether the level of PD-1 protein in a tumor can predict how well the new immunotherapies will work. Earlier this month, Roche said that a mid-stage trial of its experimental immunotherapy, MPDL3280A, showed it doubled the likelihood of survival for lung cancer patients with the highest levels PD-L1.     A separate trial of Merck’s Keytruda to be released at ASCO was designed to see whether a higher number of genetic mutations in a tumor can lead to better results in treating colorectal and other cancers. Doctors at the meeting will also hear more on the potential for combining different types of immunotherapies to make them more effective, as well as the high costs associated with multiple treatment regimens. Treatment with Opdivo or Keytruda alone in the United States, for example, costs about $12,500 per month, or $150,000 a year. “Really the name of the game is having overall survival data in your label,” said Suntrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris.

790,MRK,Merck immunotherapy appears effective in head and neck cancer-study,"(Reuters) - A Merck & Co drug that helps the immune system fight cancer was about twice as effective as the current standard therapy for patients with recurrent or advanced head and neck cancers, according to study data released on Friday. A quarter of the 132 patients who received the drug, Keytruda (pembrolizumab), saw their tumors shrink by at least 30 percent. Fifty-six percent of patients experienced at least some tumor shrinkage in the ongoing single drug Phase I study dubbed Keynote-012, researchers reported. “This is remarkable because we don’t usually see this level of activity with new agents. We have a track record of failure,” said Dr. Tanguy Seiwert, lead investigator of the study from the University of Chicago. Advanced head and neck cancer is currently treated with Eli Lilly’s Erbitux, known chemically as cetuximab, which typically has a response rate of 10 percent to 13 percent. “The only thing that works is cetuximab and this looks at least twice as good,” said Seiwert, who was presenting the Keytruda data at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago. Merck shares rose more than 1 percent to $60.43 on the New York Stock Exchange. Keytruda and Opdivo from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co are at the forefront of a promising new class of drugs called PD-1 inhibitors that block a mechanism tumors use to evade the immune system. Keytruda is approved to treat advanced melanoma and awaits a decision for use in lung cancer. It is being tested against 30 types of cancer alone and in various combinations. While overall survival data was not yet available, Keytruda and Opdivo have extended survival for some patients in other cancers. “Response rate doesn’t do this justice,” Seiwert said. “A fraction of those patients will probably have long term survival. It can really make a difference for some patients who have incurable metastatic disease.” The drug appeared to work as well for patients whose cancer tested positive for human papillomavirus as those who were HPV negative. Some older treatments may be less effective in HPV positive patients, researchers said.  Keytruda was well tolerated with few side effects, Seiwert said. Serious immune-related side effects, such as inflammation of the lungs or colon, were reported in a very small number of patients in the study.

793,MRK,Merck accused of stonewalling in mumps vaccine antitrust lawsuit,"(Reuters) - Two former Merck & Co Inc scientists accusing the drugmaker of falsifying tests of its exclusive mumps vaccine said in a court filing on Monday that Merck is refusing to respond to questions about the efficacy of the vaccine. Attorneys at Constantine Cannon, who represent the scientists, asked U.S. Magistrate Judge Lynne Sitarski of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to compel Merck to respond to their discovery request, which asks the company to give the efficacy of the vaccine as a percentage. Instead of answering the question, the letter said, Merck has been consistently evasive, using “cut-and-paste” answers saying it cannot run a new clinical trial to determine the current efficacy, and providing only data from 50 years ago. “Merck should not be permitted to raise as one of its principal defenses that its vaccine has a high efficacy, which is accurately represented on the product’s label, but then refuse to answer what it claims that efficacy actually is,” the letter said. A representative of Merck could not immediately be reached for comment. The two scientists, Stephen Krahling and Joan Wlochowski, filed their whistleblower lawsuit in 2010 claiming Merck, the only company licensed by the Food and Drug Administration to sell a mumps vaccine in the United States, skewed tests of the vaccine by adding animal antibodies to blood samples. As a result, they said, Merck was able to produce test results showing that the vaccine was 95 percent effective, even though more accurate tests would have shown a lower success rate. The plaintiffs said these false results kept competitors from trying to produce their own mumps vaccines, since they were unable to match the effectiveness Merck claimed. In 2012, Alabama-based Chatom Primary Care and two individual doctors, all purchasers of the vaccine, filed a proposed antitrust class action based on the allegations in the whistleblower suit. The two suits are now being coordinated before U.S. District Judge C. Darnell Jones and Magistrate Judge Sitarski. The case is United States ex rel Krahling et al v.

Merck submitted concessions on May 22, according to a filing on the EU executive’s website. “The decision is conditional on the divestment of certain Sigma-Aldrich assets, including manufacturing assets in Germany, the rights to certain brands and a sales force,” the Commission said in a statement. “The Commission had concerns that the merged entity would have faced insufficient competitive pressure from the remaining players in the markets for certain laboratory chemicals, with a risk of price rises. The commitments offered by the companies address these concerns.”    (Reporting by Robin Emmott, editing by David Evans)",6152015,http://www.reuters.com/article/sigma-aldrich-merck-ma-eu/european-commission-approves-mercks-17-bln-sigma-aldrich-buy-idUSL5N0Z14D820150615

799,MRK,"Merck Manuals health guides go digital, and free, in global push","June 16 (Reuters) - Merck Manuals, the widely used health guides provided by drugmaker Merck & Co, are moving to a digital-only format in 10 different languages as part of an effort to educate the global community on medical issues. The new version of Merck Manuals debuted in the U.S. in April, offering free online access to both professional and consumer audiences. The professional manuals have been distributed in print since 1899 and most recently carried a price tag of nearly $80. New websites will launch in other English-speaking countries in July, while sites translated into nine other languages are expected in the next 12 to 18 months. An English-language mobile app is set to launch by at least early 2016, with translated apps to follow, the company said. Outside of the U.S. and Canada, the sites and apps will be known as MSD Manuals. By offering both professional and consumer-oriented content free of charge, users can find what they are looking for in as much detail as they need, said Merck Manuals editor-in-chief Robert Porter. The information is compiled by hundreds of medical experts across the world. “We would like to show information as a universal right, not a commodity,” Porter said in an interview. Over 100 videos for performing medical procedures will be included in the professional mobile app, “so if you’re up the Amazon and haven’t delivered a baby in a while, we’ll have that available” for healthcare providers, Porter said. The switch to digital is also an effort to help readers quickly access authoritative health content among the hundreds of results that can pop up in an Internet search. In a survey of over 2,000 people conducted for Merck Manuals by Harris Poll, 28 percent of Americans say that overwhelming amounts of information online is their biggest barrier to increasing medical knowledge, while 79 percent believe that having access to the same information as their doctor would improve how they understand their health. The new U.S. websites have had about 4 million unique visitors since their April launch, and Merck Manuals will continue to invest millions of dollars each year to maintain the digital publication.

800,MRK,Merck to pay $5.9 million for misleading marketing of pink eye drug: U.S,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc has agreed to pay $5.9 million to resolve claims that a former unit fraudulently promoted a drug used to treat pink eye for unapproved purposes, U.S. authorities announced on Wednesday. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said Inspire Pharmaceuticals, which Merck acquired in 2011 and later sold, promoted its drug AzaSite to healthcare providers for uses the Food and Drug Administration had not approved as safe and effective. While the FDA had approved AzaSite for treating bacterial conjunctivitis, or pink eye, Inspire sought more revenue by marketing the drug for the non-approved treatment of another eye condition, blepharitis, according to a lawsuit. The lawsuit said that Inspire from 2008 through May 2011 misleadingly marketed to doctors purported anti-inflammatory properties of AzaSite that were not supported by substantial evidence or clinical experience. The marketing caused doctors to prescribe AzaSite for uses not covered by federal healthcare programs, which paid millions of dollars in false claims, the lawsuit said. As part of the settlement, which will go to the United States and various state governments, Inspire made several admissions related to its conduct, Bharara’s office said. Lainie Keller, a Merck spokeswoman, said the company was “glad to put this behind us,” adding that the conduct at issue occurred prior to Merck acquiring Inspire, which it later sold to Akorn Inc in 2013. The case was initiated in 2010 by a purported whistleblower, Jill DeGuzman, under the False Claims Act, and the United States subsequently intervened in it.

The FDA said it had identified 33 cases of severe joint pain in patients taking a class of drugs known as DPP-4 inhibitors between Oct. 16, 2006, when the first one was approved, through Dec. 31, 2013. The most frequent number of cases, 28, occurred with Januvia, known generically as sitagliptin. Five cases were reported with AstraZeneca Plc’s Onglyza (saxagliptin), two with Boehringer Ingelheim’s Tradjenta (linagliptin), and one with Takeda Pharmaceutical’s Nesina (alogliptin). A spokesman for Merck, Steven Cragle, said the reason the number of cases was higher with Januvia is that it was the first to market and is the most widely prescribed, accounting for about 80 percent of DPP-4 prescriptions in the United States. “Merck takes all safety information seriously and we worked closely with the FDA on this request,” Cragle said. “We are confident in the safety profile of sitagliptin.” Boehringer Ingelheim spokeswoman Emily Geary said clinical trials of Tradjenta “do not show an imbalance between linagliptin and placebo in musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders or, more specifically, in joint disorders.” A spokesman for AstraZeneca, Andrew Davis, said the company “works with health authorities and scientific experts to help ensure patients and physicians have a clear understanding of the risk benefit profile of our medications.” A spokesman for Takeda did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The FDA said that in 20 of the cases the DPP-4 inhibitor was suspected as a cause of the pain and was discontinued within a month after the onset of symptoms. In eight of the remaining 13 cases, a period of 44 days to a year elapsed between the onset of symptoms and discontinuation of the drug.

The late-stage study compared 25 mg of the drug, omarigliptin, to 100 mg of Januvia. Both treatments belong to a family of drugs called DPP-4 inhibitors that help lower blood sugar levels. Fifty-one percent of patients taking omarigliptin reached required sugar levels at week 24, compared with 49 percent of those who took Januvia. Merck, which has already applied for marketing approval for the drug in Japan, said it would submit its application in the United States by the end of 2015. Januvia, among Merck’s best-selling drugs, raked in sales of about $4 billion in 2014, plus another $1.8 billion for the related combination product Janumet.

820,MRK,UPDATE 3-Lilly diabetes drug slashes deaths in patients with heart risk,"(Adds American Diabetes Association comment) By Ransdell Pierson Sept 17 (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co’s new Jardiance pill slashed deaths by 32 percent in patients with type 2 diabetes at risk of heart attack and stroke, a finding that could make it a mainstay diabetes treatment and triple its use, according to researchers and analysts. Lilly shares jumped as much as 9 percent after data from the trial was released Thursday at a medical meeting in Stockholm. “This is the first diabetes therapy to show robust effect in reducing cardiovascular death. It really is big news,” said Dr. Bernard Zinman, director of the Diabetes Centre at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, who led the three-year study of 7,000 people. Because about one-half of the deaths in people with type 2 diabetes are caused by cardiovascular disease, reducing cardiovascular risk is considered essential to diabetes care. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the disease and is linked to obesity. Jardiance, a once-a-day pill which won U.S. approval last year, belongs to a new family of treatments called SGLT2 inhibitors that include Johnson & Johnson’s Invokana and AstraZeneca Plc’s Farxiga. They lower blood sugar by inhibiting reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys. Jardiance was developed jointly with Germany’s privately held Boehringer Ingelheim. Zinman, in an interview, predicted the new study would prompt medical societies to recommend that Jardiance be used by type 2 diabetics who have a history of heart disease or who are at risk of cardiovascular events. About 26 million Americans have type 2 diabetes, according to federal data for 2014. The vast majority of those patients could be candidates for Jardiance, which costs over $4,000 per year, Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said. “The big news here is that the drug reduced cardiovascular stuff. That has not been the case with all things in diabetes,” said David Marrero, president of health care and education at the American Diabetes Association. “It is probably going to be a more popular drug because of that.” Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson more than tripled his annual sales forecast for Jardiance and combination drugs containing it to $2.7 billion by 2020. He cut his 2020 sales forecast for Merck & Co Inc’s Januvia, the leading member of a competing class of oral diabetes drugs called DPP-4 inhibitors, to $6 billion from $7.8 billion. Anderson estimates Jardiance could boost Lilly’s earnings per share by 8 percent on average across 2016 to 2020. In the study, patients taking Jardiance had a 38 percent reduction in cardiovascular death, including from heart attacks and strokes. There was no significant difference in non-fatal heart attacks or non-fatal strokes. Those taking Jardiance had a 32 percent lower risk of dying from any cause, and a 35 percent lower rate of hospitalizations from heart failure. The benefits were especially impressive because they added to protection that patients received from taking cholesterol fighters and other life-saving heart drugs, Zinman said. “This is a wonderful thing,” said Dr. Jerome Tolbert of Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital in New York. He has not prescribed Jardiance and similar drugs as frequently as treatments like Januvia, but expects that may change based on the new data. Zinman noted that Jardiance, like other SGLT2 drugs, causes weight loss and reduced blood pressure, besides lowering both blood sugar levels and body fat, and also reduces swelling, which all help the cardiovascular system. Lilly and Boehringer last month disclosed that Jardiance met its primary study goal, becoming the first diabetes drug to show heart-protective results in a large cardiovascular trial. But they did not unveil detailed data until Thursday at the medical meeting. Shares of Lily closed up 6.5 percent at $89.98 on Thursday, after rising as high as $92.83. In calculating the combined number of cardiac deaths, non-fatal heart attacks and non-fatal strokes, 14 percent fewer events were seen in patients taking Jardiance in combination with standard treatments, compared with patients who took standard treatments alone, meeting the study’s main goal. Standard treatments included statins, which lower cholesterol, and blood pressure drugs.

821,MRK,Advaxis therapy improves survival rates in cervical cancer patients,"(Reuters) - Advaxis Inc said its experimental cancer vaccine was found more effective in improving survival rates of cervical cancer patients than standard therapy, validating the technology behind its pipeline of cancer treatments. About 38.5 percent of the patients in a mid-stage study, whose disease had progressed or returned after prior therapy, survived for a year after being given the Advaxis vaccine, the biotech company said on Thursday. Advaxis shares, which had risen about 19 percent in the past three days, closed up 0.5 percent at $19.71 on Thursday. However, the stock slumped as much as 28 percent just after the data was reported. “The initial reaction was mostly driven by expectations for a higher 12-month survival,” FBR & Co analyst Vernon Bernardino said. “However, that probably was driven by a whisper number which moved the stock up 20 percent in the last five trading sessions.” Bernardino said the 38.5 percent survival rate Advaxis reported on Thursday was higher than the 27 percent rate its reported from earlier studies. Advaxis said there were no serious adverse events but about 15 percent of patients experienced hypotension and cytokine release syndrome, and one patient experienced lung infection and sepsis. Patients with persistent or recurrent metastatic cervical cancer survive for about four to seven months after prior treatments fail, said Dr. Tom Herzog, clinical director at the University of Cincinnati Cancer Institute. Cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths among women globally. About 12,000 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed each year in the United States.

830,MRK,FDA expands approval of Merck's Keytruda to lung cancer,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved Merck & Co Inc’s immunotherapy, Keytruda, for patients with the most common form of lung cancer whose tumors produce a specific biological marker. The FDA approval for Keytruda in advanced non-small cell lung cancer is for patients whose tumors express PD-L1, a protein targeted by the drug, and includes a companion diagnostic, made by a unit of Agilent Technologies Inc, to measure those protein levels. A Merck spokeswoman said clinical trials found that 22 percent of patients with this type of cancer had PD-L1 scores of at least 50 percent. “The restricted label is generally in line with expectations and is likely to broaden over time as data from additional trials support Keytruda’s efficacy in a larger patient population,” JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott said in a research note. The FDA decision “has the potential to transform the way that lung cancer is treated,” Dr. Edward Garon, associate clinical professor at the University of California, Los Angeles and a lead investigator on Keytruda clinical trials, said in a statement. Merck said the price of Keytruda for health insurers and other payers is around $12,500 per month, or $150,000 a year. Keytruda and another similar treatment from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co called Opdivo are antibodies designed to block the interaction between PD-L1 and another protein, PD-1, whose natural function is to put checks on the immune system. By blocking the interaction, the drugs aim to enable the patient’s own immune system to attack the cancer. Wall Street analysts expect cancer immunotherapies to earn combined annual sales of over $20 billion by 2020. Bristol’s Opdivo is approved by the FDA to treat melanoma as well as squamous non-small cell lung cancer, a smaller subset of the disease, but without a requirement for protein testing. Keytruda, now approved for both squamous and non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, is also approved to treat patients with advanced melanoma.

834,MRK,Ex-Merck employees gets 3 years in prison for insider trading,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former Merck & Co Inc  employee was sentenced to more than three years in prison on Tuesday for engaging in an insider trading scheme by tipping a friend at Bank of New York Mellon Corp about potential pharmaceutical mergers. Zachary Zwerko, a former senior finance analyst at Merck who was involved with performing work on potential corporate deals, was also ordered by U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein in Manhattan to pay more than $694,000. The case was the latest in a string of insider trading prosecutions pursued under Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, whose office confirmed Zwerko’s sentence. Bharara’s office since 2009 has secured convictions of 83 people. Zwerko, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, was sentenced to 37 months in prison. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy and securities fraud charges in February. His plea followed that of David Post, a friend from Rutgers Business School and a former BNY Mellon product manager, who pleaded guilty in October 2014. Prosecutors said Zwerko in 2010 proposed passing along information about drug company deals to Post to trade on in exchange for a cut in the profits. After some time passed, Zwerko began funneling information to Post, resulting in him buying shares of Ardea BioSciences Inc, which while not bought by Merck was ultimately acquired by AstraZeneca Plc in 2012, prosecutors said. Post’s trading that time resulted in $105,000 in profits, prosecutors said, and Zwerko subsequently passed along tips on five other transactions. While some of Post’s trades were not profitable, his trading in 2014 ahead of Merck’s acquisition of Idenix Pharmaceuticals resulted in a major windfall of $579,000, which he had planned to split with Zwerko, prosecutors said. In total, the insider trading scheme generated illegal profits of at least $737,000, and Post paid Zwerko $57,000 as part of his expected cut, prosecutors said. The case is U.S. v.

835,MRK,India risks missing boat as biosimilars shake up drug industry,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India, which has dominated the generic drugs industry for decades, is falling behind in the race to make copies of complex biotech drugs, which are expected to generate tens of billions of dollars in sales in the coming years. While Indian firms have launched a few such products on the domestic market, where regulatory barriers are relatively low, they are being overtaken by European, American and South Korean firms in the race to supply lucrative Western markets. Just three Indian groups - Biocon Ltd, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd and Intas Pharamceuticals Ltd - are working with partners on so-called biosimilars aimed at the United States and Europe. Biotech drugs, which require genetic engineering, account for a growing share of new drugs and the future sales of copycat products will also switch to this category of pharmaceuticals from simple small-molecule pills like aspirin. The global biosimilars market is predicted to have sales of $25 billion by 2020, according to a 2014 Thomson Reuters report. “Biosimilars is a big opportunity,” said Sujay Shetty, leader of the life sciences practice at PwC India. “But unlike generics, it is not yet an opportunity (for Indian companies) in the U.S.” Copying chemical-based drugs has long been the bedrock of India’s $15 billion pharmaceuticals industry. Biotech drugs, however, are more difficult to make and cannot be replicated exactly, which is why regulators have come up with the notion of versions that are similar enough to do the job. That also means regulators will be eagle-eyed on quality, posing a challenge to Indian companies, which have been distracted in recent years by manufacturing problems that have led to some drugs being barred from key overseas markets. Many, including the country’s biggest drugmaker Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, are still struggling to fix issues at their generic drug factories. Biosimilars have been available in India since the early 2000s, well before their 2006 arrival in Europe and the recent introduction of a regulatory pathway in the United States, where the first biosimilar was launched only last month. But India’s experience has not been problem-free. Intas, for example, recently received reports of some patients on its biosimilar version of Roche’s eye drug Lucentis developing inflammation barely two months after the drug’s launch. An Intas spokesman said the problem was found to be in the drug’s “cold chain logistics” distribution channel and has restricted supply of the drug. Arun Chandavarkar, the chief executive of Biocon, seen by analysts as the front-runner among Indian firms developing biosimilars, believes the cost and complexity of developing biosimilars will be a deterrent for many Indian players. “At this time, there can’t be too many companies willing to put in that much effort and investment,” he said. The three Indian companies that have stated plans to make biosimilars for the United States and Europe are all partnered with larger Western firms. Biocon has a tie-up with Mylan Inc and is testing four molecules in global Phase III trials, for which it plans to seek approvals in the United States and Europe starting in fiscal 2017, Chandavarkar said. Dr Reddy’s is developing biosimilars such as rituximab and pegfilgrastim for use in cancer treatment under a pact with Germany’s Merck KGaA and said it plans to launch its first biosimilar in the United States by 2018. A spokesman at Intas, which developed pegfilgrastim in partnership with Canada’s Apotex Inc, told Reuters the company was considering partnering with a Swiss drugmaker to launch the product in the United States. It declined to name the firm. Chandru Chawla, head of Cipla Ltd’s new ventures unit, said India’s “fundamental disadvantage” over United States, Europe and South Korea was that biotechnology never evolved in India to the extent that chemistry did. “In terms of having the right knowledge ecosystem and the pools of talent, India is far behind,” he said. Globally, Western pharmaceutical firms such as Novartis AG; Pfizer Inc, in partnership with South Korea’s Celltrion Inc; and Merck & Co with partner Samsung Bioepis, are leading in the race to dominate the Western biosimilars market. “South Korea has made very significant strides in a very short period of time,” said Cartikeya Reddy, Dr Reddy’s executive vice president for biologics. “In this regard they have indeed pulled ahead of Indian companies.” ",10142015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-biosimilars/india-risks-missing-boat-as-biosimilars-shake-up-drug-industry-idUSKCN0S82OQ20151014

That also means regulators will be eagle-eyed on quality, posing a challenge to Indian companies, which have been distracted in recent years by manufacturing problems that have led to some drugs being barred from key overseas markets. Many, including the country’s biggest drugmaker Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, are still struggling to fix issues at their generic drug factories. Biosimilars have been available in India since the early 2000s, well before their 2006 arrival in Europe and the recent introduction of a regulatory pathway in the United States, where the first biosimilar was launched only last month. But India’s experience has not been problem-free. Intas, for example, recently received reports of some patients on its biosimilar version of Roche’s eye drug Lucentis developing inflammation barely two months after the drug’s launch. An Intas spokesman said the problem was found to be in the drug’s “cold chain logistics” distribution channel and has restricted supply of the drug. Arun Chandavarkar, the chief executive of Biocon, seen by analysts as the front-runner among Indian firms developing biosimilars, believes the cost and complexity of developing biosimilars will be a deterrent for many Indian players. “At this time, there can’t be too many companies willing to put in that much effort and investment,” he said. The three Indian companies that have stated plans to make biosimilars for the United States and Europe are all partnered with larger Western firms. Biocon has a tie-up with Mylan Inc and is testing four molecules in global Phase III trials, for which it plans to seek approvals in the United States and Europe starting in fiscal 2017, Chandavarkar said. Dr Reddy’s is developing biosimilars such as rituximab and pegfilgrastim for use in cancer treatment under a pact with Germany’s Merck KGaA and said it plans to launch its first biosimilar in the United States by 2018. A spokesman at Intas, which developed pegfilgrastim in partnership with Canada’s Apotex Inc, told Reuters the company was considering partnering with a Swiss drugmaker to launch the product in the United States. It declined to name the firm. Chandru Chawla, head of Cipla Ltd’s new ventures unit, said India’s “fundamental disadvantage” over United States, Europe and South Korea was that biotechnology never evolved in India to the extent that chemistry did. “In terms of having the right knowledge ecosystem and the pools of talent, India is far behind,” he said. Globally, Western pharmaceutical firms such as Novartis AG  ; Pfizer Inc, in partnership with South Korea’s Celltrion Inc ; and Merck & Co with partner Samsung Bioepis, are leading in the race to dominate the Western biosimilars market. “South Korea has made very significant strides in a very short period of time,” said Cartikeya Reddy, Dr Reddy’s executive vice president for biologics. “In this regard they have indeed pulled ahead of Indian companies.”   (Editing by Ben Hirschler and Rachel Armstrong)",10142015,http://www.reuters.com/article/india-biosimilars/india-risks-missing-boat-as-biosimilars-shake-up-drug-industry-idUSL3N12E1V020151014

839,MRK,Ex-Merck employees gets three years in prison for insider trading,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former Merck & Co Inc employee was sentenced to more than three years in prison on Tuesday for engaging in an insider trading scheme by tipping a friend at Bank of New York Mellon Corp about potential pharmaceutical mergers. Zachary Zwerko, a former senior finance analyst at Merck who was involved with performing work on potential corporate deals, was also ordered by U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein in Manhattan to pay more than $694,000. The case was the latest in a string of insider trading prosecutions pursued under Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, whose office confirmed Zwerko’s sentence. Bharara’s office since 2009 has secured convictions of 83 people. Zwerko, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, was sentenced to 37 months in prison. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy and securities fraud charges in February. His plea followed that of David Post, a friend from Rutgers Business School and a former BNY Mellon product manager, who pleaded guilty in October 2014. Prosecutors said Zwerko in 2010 proposed passing along information about drug company deals to Post to trade on in exchange for a cut in the profits. After some time passed, Zwerko began funneling information to Post, resulting in him buying shares of Ardea BioSciences Inc, which while not bought by Merck was ultimately acquired by AstraZeneca Plc in 2012, prosecutors said. Post’s trading that time resulted in $105,000 in profits, prosecutors said, and Zwerko subsequently passed along tips on five other transactions. While some of Post’s trades were not profitable, his trading in 2014 ahead of Merck’s acquisition of Idenix Pharmaceuticals resulted in a major windfall of $579,000, which he had planned to split with Zwerko, prosecutors said. In total, the insider trading scheme generated illegal profits of at least $737,000, and Post paid Zwerko $57,000 as part of his expected cut, prosecutors said. The case is U.S. v.

844,MRK,Specialty pharmacies in spotlight as Valeant ties questioned,"LOS ANGELES, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Investor concerns over accounting practices at Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc have put a spotlight on the little-known and fast-growing specialty pharmacy industry. Shares of Valeant fell 19 percent on Wednesday after influential short-seller Citron Research accused the company of using specialty pharmacies, through a network led by its partner Philidor Rx Services, to inflate its revenue, an allegation the drugmaker denied. Specialty pharmacies are designed to deliver medications with unique handling, storage and distribution requirements, often for patients with complex conditions such as cancer, multiple sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis. They can provide more detailed guidance for patients on how to take the drugs. Specialty drugs are often expensive, sometimes priced at over $100,000 a year. The industry has been growing quickly as drugmakers shift research and sales efforts to more complex medications. Pembroke Consulting estimated early this year that the number of accredited specialty pharmacies would jump by nearly 100 to a total of 250 in 2015. In the past, drugmakers were directly involved in distribution of their products. Merck & Co, for example, owned a pharmacy service company known as Medco. But it spun off that business in 2003, partly due to concerns over potential conflicts of interest. Medco was later acquired by Express Scripts Holding Co , which is now the largest U.S. pharmacy benefits manager. A New York Times report earlier this week said that Valeant worked with Philidor Rx Services, based in Hatboro, Pennsylvania, to increase sales, and prices, for treatments that don’t meet the specialty criterion, including drugs for acne and toenail fungus, and that regular pharmacies may not prescribe. The same day, Valeant disclosed that a growing percentage of its revenue is coming from products dispensed through specialty pharmacies, and that it had purchased an option to acquire Philidor. Valeant is Philidor’s main customer. “We find specialty pharmacies improve patients’ access to medicines at an affordable price, and help ensure physicians are able to prescribe the medications they believe most appropriate for their patients,” Valeant Chief Executive Michael Pearson told investors on a conference call. He said that for many of the company’s skin products, Philidor and other specialty pharmacies fill a customer’s prescription before reimbursement is worked out with an insurer, and that Valeant only recognizes revenue from the products once the drug reaches a patient. Pearson also described how Valeant’s relationship with another specialty pharmacy, R&O; Pharmacy LLC of Camarillo, California, turned sour. Valeant said it had shipped $69 million worth of medications at wholesale prices to R&O;, and that the pharmacy “is currently improperly holding significant amounts it receives” from insurers. R&O; has sued Valeant in California over its efforts to claim the money, saying it has no contractual relationship with the drugmaker. Representatives of R&O; declined to comment. Citron alleged that R&O; and Philidor may actually be the same company, and that the two were used by Valeant to create phantom accounts to inflate revenue. In a statement, Philidor said R&O; is part of its network of affiliated pharmacies and that it provides services to those partners including call center functions, help with insurance claims, technical support and “certain management services.” “Philidor does not currently have a direct equity ownership in R&O; Pharmacy or the affiliated pharmacies, but does have a contractual right to acquire the pharmacies now or in the future subject to regulatory approval,” the statement said. Scott Knoer, chief pharmacy officer at the Cleveland Clinic, said the web of relationships raises concern. Cleveland Clinic and other hospitals have been hit financially by Valeant price increases on heart drugs Isuprel and Nitropress. “There would be an inherent conflict of interest if a specialty pharmacy is owned by someone making the drug,” Knoer said. “There could be pressure on the pharmacy to start patients on the drug, or continue patients on it, or not stop them” as warranted. While concerns over Valeant’s ties to its specialty pharmacies hit rival stocks on Wednesday, both Allergan Plc  and Endo International Plc were quick to say their businesses did not operate in the same manner. Allergan said about 3 percent of its U.S. sales of branded drugs are distributed through specialty pharmacies, most of which are specialty products that require careful handling. Endo said it uses specialty pharmacies mainly for branded products that need to be administered by doctors, and that drugs distributed through this channel represent about 3 percent of the company’s projected total revenue for 2015. It said any specialty pharmacies that it works with are fully independent of the company.

845,MRK,Merck's Keytruda extends survival in lung cancer study,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co’s approved Keytruda lung cancer treatment provided superior overall survival to chemotherapy in a late-stage study of patients with advanced disease whose tumors produce a protein called PD-L1 associated with increased risk of the disease. The U.S. drugmaker on Monday said patients taking the approved 2 milligram dosage of Keytruda and those taking an experimental 10 milligram dose had longer overall survival compared with those taking docetaxel, a standard treatment for non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common form of lung cancer. Keytruda thereby met its main goal of the study. Patients whose tumors had especially high levels of PD-L1 also went longer without a progression of disease than those taking docetaxel, Merck said. Those whose tumors expressed PD-L1, but not at high levels, did not show such a statistically  significant benefit in progression-free survival. Safety of Keytruda was consistent with what had been seen in previous trials among lung cancer patients, Merck said in a release that included only summary “topline” information from the results. More detailed data from the study will be provided soon, Merck said, adding that it will ask the U.S. Food and Drug Administration later this year to add the new data to the drug’s package insert label.   U.S. regulators in October approved Keytruda on an accelerated basis for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors produce PD-L1. The approval was contingent on the company providing more detailed data in the future on Keytruda’s safety and effectiveness. Keytruda and a similar treatment from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co called Opdivo are antibodies designed to block the interaction between PD-L1 and another protein, PD-1, whose natural function is to put checks on the immune system. By blocking the interaction, the drugs aim to enable the patient’s own immune system to recognize and therefore attack the cancer.

847,MRK,"Merck profit tops estimates on strong diabetes, cancer drug sales","(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) on Tuesday reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year forecast as demand for its diabetes and cancer drugs increased. Combined sales of diabetes drug Januvia and a related pill called Janumet, which have struggled to grow in the past year, jumped 10 percent to $1.58 billion in the third quarter after only a 1 percent rise in the previous period.  Adam Schechter, Merck’s head of global human health, said in a conference call with analysts that the treatments for type 2 diabetes got a $100 million boost from stocking by wholesalers. But he cautioned that the gain would hamper their sales in the fourth quarter and beyond. Schechter said the volume of Januvia sales rose 4 percent in the quarter, which he called an encouraging trend.

He predicted the drug, which blocks a protein called PD-1 that allows tumors to hide from the immune system, would achieve annual sales of about $9 billion by 2023 as a treatment for multiple types of cancer.

852,MRK,FDA panel backs Merck & Co drug to reverse muscle relaxant effect,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co’s drug to reverse the effects of muscle relaxants used in surgery is safe and effective enough to warrant approval, an independent panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said.  The drug, which goes by the chemical name of sugammadex, has repeatedly been rejected by the FDA due to concerns about potentially dangerous allergic reactions, even though it is approved in more than 75 countries. The company acquired the drug when it bought U.S. drugmaker Schering Plough, which developed sugammadex, in 2009.  Merck shares were down 1 percent on Friday, after the company said in a separate statement on Thursday that it had received a civil investigation demand from a U.S. Attorney’s Office in Pennsylvania over the pricing of its asthma medicine, Dulera. Independent advisers to the FDA said in a meeting on Friday that they were satisfied with the potential hypersensitivity and cardiac risk associated with the drug when it was used in a monitored setting.  Panelists underscored the fact that existing agents carried similar risks. A majority of the voters suggested additional studies to evaluate risks in vulnerable populations such as the elderly and obese, pediatric and pregnant patients. Sugammadex, an injectable drug, is sold in over 50 countries. More than 12 million doses of the drug have been sold as of April 22 since it was first approved in 2008 in Europe.  FDA staff had noted on Wednesday that hypersensitivity related to the drug appeared to increase with higher doses, but not with repeated exposure. (1.usa.gov/1kzg2PA) Brokerage Cowen & Co estimates that sugammadex, if approved in the United States, could generate annual sales of $550 million in the country by 2020.  This will make the drug, sold overseas under the brand name Bridion, a moderate-sized product for Merck.  The FDA usually follows the panel’s recommendations, but is not obligated to do so. The agency is expected to make its final decision on the drug by Dec. 19.

854,MRK,UPDATE 2-FDA panel backs Merck & Co drug to reverse muscle relaxant effect,"(Adds details, background; updates shares) By Natalie Grover and Samantha Kareen Nair Nov 6 (Reuters) - Merck & Co’s drug to reverse the effects of muscle relaxants used in surgery is safe and effective enough to warrant approval, an independent panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said. The drug, which goes by the chemical name of sugammadex, has repeatedly been rejected by the FDA due to concerns about potentially dangerous allergic reactions, even though it is approved in more than 75 countries. The company acquired the drug when it bought U.S. drugmaker Schering Plough, which developed sugammadex, in 2009. Merck shares were down 1 percent on Friday, after the company said in a separate statement on Thursday that it had received a civil investigation demand from a U.S. Attorney’s Office in Pennsylvania over the pricing of its asthma medicine, Dulera. Independent advisers to the FDA said in a meeting on Friday that they were satisfied with the potential hypersensitivity and cardiac risk associated with the drug when it was used in a monitored setting. Panelists underscored the fact that existing agents carried similar risks. A majority of the voters suggested additional studies to evaluate risks in vulnerable populations such as the elderly and obese, pediatric and pregnant patients. Sugammadex, an injectable drug, is sold in over 50 countries. More than 12 million doses of the drug have been sold as of April 22 since it was first approved in 2008 in Europe. FDA staff had noted on Wednesday that hypersensitivity related to the drug appeared to increase with higher doses, but not with repeated exposure. (1.usa.gov/1kzg2PA) Brokerage Cowen & Co estimates that sugammadex, if approved in the United States, could generate annual sales of $550 million in the country by 2020. This will make the drug, sold overseas under the brand name Bridion, a moderate-sized product for Merck. The FDA usually follows the panel’s recommendations, but is not obligated to do so. The agency is expected to make its final decision on the drug by Dec. 19.

863,MRK,"Germany, U.S. in hot pursuit of 'messenger' drug molecules","FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - A molecule that carries the recipe for making drugs inside body cells is exciting scientists and investors alike, attracting hundreds of millions of dollars in a scramble for the next promising area of biotechnology. German and U.S. firms are leading the way in synthetic messenger RNA, or mRNA technology, a new approach to tackling a range of hard-to-treat diseases. In theory, the promise of mRNA is enormous, ranging from cancer to infectious diseases to heart and kidney disorders, since it could be used to tackle the 80 percent of proteins that are difficult to affect with existing medicines. Despite a recent sell-off in biotech stocks, sparked by U.S. Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s threat to crack down on drug pricing, enthusiasm for mRNA, is rising. Four-year-old Moderna Therapeutics, based in Massachusetts, which raised a record-breaking $450 million in a private funding round in January, valuing it at $3 billion, has so far hogged the limelight but German companies are flexing their muscles. Privately-held CureVac in the university town of Tuebingen, which already has backing from Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates thanks to its vaccine work, last week raised $110 million from new investors, valuing it at $1.6 billion. And Mainz-based BioNTech clinched a deal possibly worth up to $1.5 billion with Sanofi to use mRNA to fight cancer. BioNTech is owned by the Struengmann family who sold generic drugmaker Hexal to Novartis in 2005.  Driving the point home, the third International mRNA Health Conference is being held in Berlin this week. Moderna, CureVac and BioNTech are all sponsoring the event. Today’s biotech medicines use complex proteins or antibodies to treat disease, while traditional tablets such as aspirin or Viagra are simple chemicals. Harnessing synthetic mRNA is a different model altogether. In effect, mRNA serves as software that can be injected into the body to instruct ribosomes, the “3D-printers” found inside cells, to churn out desired proteins. “This is a radically different approach from conventional approaches, where therapeutic proteins are produced outside the human body and active ingredients need to be isolated, purified and cooled and then be inserted back into the human body at great complexity and cost,” said CureVac co-founder and CEO Ingmar Hoerr. LONG-TERM BET Single-stranded RNA, which helps to relay information encoded in double-helix DNA molecules, for a long time attracted only academic interest because it was seen as too unstable to handle.  But advances in chemistry have increased both stability and potency, paving the way to the creation of potential drugs, although big challenges remain to prove their clinical value. “It’s still a long-term bet,” said Andy Smith, chief investment officer at fund manager Mann Bioinvest. “I don’t think it is ready for prime time just yet.”  Still, ever more big pharmaceutical companies are lining up to do deals with mRNA firms. Some of the most advanced work to date has been in vaccines, where CureVac is a leader with clinical trials in prostate cancer and rabies. Overall, the company has tested its products on more than 300 clinical trial participants and its relatively maturity means it could be the first mRNA player to go public. The company says it is getting ready for a possible initial public offering, but declines to say when. Moderna has yet to start clinical trials, although it has ambitious plans for parallel studies with multiple drug candidates, alongside partners including AstraZeneca, Merck & Co and Alexion. Marcus Schindler, vice president for cardiovascular and metabolic drug discovery at AstraZeneca, is particularly excited about the promise of mRNA in producing a radical new treatment for heart failure, by regenerating cardiac tissue. AstraZeneca plans to start testing mRNA as an agent to improve coronary blood flow in human trials in 2016. This  follows promising data in animals that suggests synthetic mRNA can be delivered accurately and produce the right amount of protein. “The field is moving very rapidly,” Schindler said. “I predict it will have a significant impact.” As a chemically synthesized product, Schindler believes mRNA should be cheaper to make than current costly antibody drugs. But potential obstacles remain in the form of optimizing drug delivery and possible side effects, while the history of biotech advances suggests some unforeseen setbacks are likely as the technology moves into large clinical trials.   Other companies working in the mRNA area include Argos Therapeutics, eTheRNA, Ethris and Factor Bioscience.

Merck said on Friday that the committee reviewed safety and efficacy data from the large study, including a futility analysis. A futility analysis is done to gauge if a study is likely to succeed or fail. Merck is now the only major drugmaker still aggressively developing a CETP inhibitor - drugs aimed at raising HDL, or “good cholesterol” levels in the blood and cutting levels of LDL, or “bad cholesterol”. Lilly stopped testing the drug for cholesterol due to low likelihood of it meeting the main goal of the study.

876,MRK,"Merck, BioLineRX to study drug combo to fight pancreatic cancer","JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli biopharmaceutical company BioLineRX Ltd said on Tuesday it would collaborate with U.S. industry heavyweight Merck to test a combination of drugs for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. The companies will partner in a mid-stage study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of BioLineRx’s BL-8040 and Merck’s Keytruda in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. “Because certain tumors exhibit only a modest response to existing immunotherapies, we are increasingly seeing clinical studies involving combinations of immuno-oncology agents with other classes of drugs,” said Kinneret Savitsky, BioLineRx’s chief executive. BL-8040 acts against CXCR4 receptors that are involved in tumor progression, the company said. It has been shown in several clinical trials to mobilize immune cells and to be effective at inducing direct tumor cell death. Keytruda, an antibody, works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells, said Merck, which is known as MSD outside the United States and Canada. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma accounts for most cases of pancreatic cancer, according to the American Cancer Society.  Specific symptoms often do not develop until the disease has reached an advanced stage, which is reflected in a low five-year survival rate.

878,MRK,Fight over Merck name sees German firm win in British court,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany’s Merck KGaA said it won a British court’s backing in its quest to keep U.S. namesake drugmaker Merck & Co Inc from doing business under the Merck name outside North America, part of an increasingly bitter legal feud. Merck KGaA of Germany, maker of multiple sclerosis drug Rebif and liquid crystals for display screens, and Merck & Co, which is about 2.5 times as big by sales, share historic roots but have been under separate ownership since World War One. The companies struck an agreement in 1955 and amended it in 1970, giving Merck & Co. the rights to the Merck name in the United States and Canada and handing the rights everywhere else in the world to Merck KGaA.  Under the deal, Merck & Co agreed to call itself MSD, or Merck Sharp & Dohme, outside North America, with Merck KGaA  operating as EMD, short for Emanuel Merck, Darmstadt, in North America. “In its judgment the English High Court stated that MSD had breached an agreement with the company by using ‘Merck’ alone in the UK either as a trade mark or a name, online or offline,” the German group said in a statement on Friday. The emergence of the Internet and global electronic media that can be viewed across continents has exposed gaping holes in the decades-old agreement. In the British lawsuit, Germany’s Merck objected to Merck & Co’s use of domaine names such as merckresponsibility.com merckformothers.com in Britain and to Merck & Co’s Britain-based staff using a merck.com email address, among other practices. A Merck & Co spokeswoman said in an emailed statement the company disagreed with the ruling: “This decision reflects one step in a litigation process taking place in a number of countries, and will be appealed.” She said a French court recently ruled that the U.S. group’s use of Merck in employee email addresses and the title Merck Manual did not infringe Merck KGaA’s rights, whereas certain uses of Merck on French websites were found to be an infringement. Merck & Co, in turn, would fight Merck KGaA in a U.S. court “regarding their improper use of the name ‘Merck’ in the United States,” the email continued. In a sign of defiance and growing frustration over what it sees as unfair use of the Merck name outside North America, the family-controlled German group, which traces its roots to a 17th century pharmacy, has started using the claim “Merck – The Original”.

880,MRK,Merck agrees to pay $830 mln to settle Vioxx securities lawsuit,"(Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co on Friday said it would pay $830 million to settle a federal class action lawsuit involving allegations the company failed to adequately inform investors about heart risks from its now-recalled Vioxx pain medication. The drug was approved by U.S. regulators in 1999 as a new type of treatment for pain and quickly became a blockbuster product, ultimately used by an estimated 20 million Americans.  But the company in 2004 recalled Vioxx from the market after a colon-polyp prevention study showed it more than doubled the risk of heart attacks or stroke after 18 months of use. After thousands of former users of Vioxx sued Merck, claiming they had been harmed by the drug, Merck in 2008 settled most remaining product-liability lawsuits for $4.85 billion. But other litigation continued, including a multi-district class action lawsuit pending against Merck in New Jersey federal court, which alleged Merck kept investors in the dark about negative data from earlier company-sponsored trials of the medicine. Merck on Friday said it had agreed to settle that lawsuit by paying $830 million to investors who bought Merck stock between May 21, 1999 and October 29, 2004, plus pay an additional amount for attorneys’ fees. The company’s cash payment for the settlement and fees will be about $680 million, after reimbursement from insurance policies, Merck said, and the company will record a charge for that amount in the fourth quarter of 2015.

883,MRK,Vaccines alliance signs $5 million advance deal for Merck's Ebola shot,"DAVOS/LONDON (Reuters) - The Gavi global alliance for vaccines and immunization group signed a $5 million advance purchase commitment on Wednesday to buy a vaccine being developed by Merck to protect against future outbreaks of the deadly Ebola virus. Gavi said the agreement would help the U.S. drugmaker take the experimental Ebola vaccine through late-stage clinical trials to licensing and then through pre-qualification by the World Health Organization (WHO). If approved, Merck’s so-called VSV-ZEBOV live attenuated Ebola Zaire vaccine would become one of the world’s first licensed Ebola shots and Gavi would be able to start buying it to create a stockpile for future outbreaks, it said in a statement issued at the World Economic Forum in Davos. A vast epidemic of Ebola which swept through three countries in West Africa last year killed more than 11,300 people and infected more than 28,600.  “The suffering caused by the Ebola crisis was a wake-up call to many in the global health community,” said Gavi’s chief executive Seth Berkley. “New threats require smart solutions and our innovative financing agreement with Merck will ensure that we are ahead of the curve for future Ebola outbreaks.” The deal was agreed on the understanding that the vaccine will be submitted for a license by the end of 2017. Speaking to Reuters in Davos, Berkley said the advance commitment should give a positive signal to drugmakers developing products that may not have an immediate market “It’s critical that we give confidence to companies that when they make this type of effort, there is somebody to buy it,” he said. As part of the agreement, Merck will ensure that 300,000 doses of the vaccine are available from May 2016 to be used in expanded use clinical trials as well as for emergency use as needed while development work on the shot continues.  Until the West Africa Ebola epidemic, which swiftly became the largest in history, previous outbreaks of the disease have infected far smaller numbers, usually fewer than 1,000 people. Initial results from a clinical trial in Guinea of the vaccine, which tested it on some 4,000 people who had been in close contact with a confirmed Ebola case, showed complete protection after 10 days. Merck says it has already submitted an application through WHO’s Emergency Use Assessment and Listing (EUAL) procedure which, if approved, would allow for the vaccine to be used if there is another Ebola emergency before it is licensed. Jeremy Farrar, director of Britain’s Wellcome Trust global health charity which co-funded clinical trials of the Merck shot, said the “remarkable results” from those trials, as well as promising progress of other vaccine candidates, were “among the few positive outcomes to emerge from the epidemic”. The WHO announced last week that no new Ebola cases had been reported in the three worst affected countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in the preceding 42 days.  Yet shortly after the WHO announcement - which included a warning that sporadic flare-ups could occur - Sierra Leone reported an Ebola-related death. Farrar said such instances show how an Ebola vaccine could yet be useful in this outbreak, even in its final stages. “As we saw with the new confirmed case just last week, the Ebola epidemic is likely to have a long tail and it’s possible that several more isolated cases will emerge in the coming weeks and months,” he said in a statement. “This vaccine...could still play an important role in containing any additional flare ups of this outbreak, as well as being available to help prevent future epidemics.” ",1202016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-ebola-vaccine/vaccines-alliance-signs-5-million-advance-deal-for-mercks-ebola-shot-idUSKCN0UY0OT

885,MRK,Merck sees deal opportunities as biotech funding gets tighter,"DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co is eager to do deals to bring in promising experimental medicines and believes a recent correction in biotechnology stocks should throw up new opportunities. “Prices have come back somewhat. That is a positive thing,” Chief Executive Kenneth Frazier told Reuters in Davos on Friday. “In particular, some of the early-stage companies are struggling to get the next round of financing as people start to be a little less willing to pay for the promise of growth, so that gives us opportunities.” Frazier said he was looking for small and medium-sized  “bolt-on” deals to bring in new drugs, although such transactions could still be sizeable. “At our size, I would say a $10 billion or $20 billion deal would qualify as a bolt-on,” he said in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum annual meeting. With a strong balance sheet, Merck has plenty of room for maneuver when it comes to capital allocation, leading some analysts to speculate it might also step up share repurchases. Frazier said finding value-creating acquisitions of external science ranked as his “number two” priority, coming behind funding for ongoing research but ahead of returning cash to shareholders. Last year, Merck did a record number of deals, though most were on the small side. Its last major deal was an agreement to buy antibiotics specialist Cubist for more than $8 billion in December 2014. Merck is not alone in chasing promising acquisitions. The wider healthcare sector saw its biggest deal-making streak ever in 2015, with global transactions totaling $673 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. The downturn in biotech stocks has been driven in part by fears among investors of a political backlash against high drug prices. Frazier said much of the anger surrounding the issue had been sparked by “a few bad actors” exploiting market failures to extract excessive profits. But he acknowledged there were also wider concerns about the affordability of medicines. “Right now we are in the middle of a presidential election season and the rhetoric level is pretty high,” he said. “But I do think people in Congress hear from their constituents at home about the challenges they have with paying for their drugs and so I think there will be pressure to do something.”      ",1222016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-merck-co-m-a-ceo/merck-sees-deal-opportunities-as-biotech-funding-gets-tighter-idUSKCN0V0205
886,MRK,U.S. FDA approves Merck's new hepatitis C pill,"Jan 28 (Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Thursday approved a new once-daily treatment for the liver-destroying hepatitis C virus made by Merck & Co Inc. The Food and Drug Administration approved the drug, Zepatier, with or without the older antiviral drug ribavirin, for patients infected with the most common form of hepatitis C, genotype 1, as well as the less common genotype 4. Zepatier will compete with drugs that include Gilead Sciences Inc’s $94,500-per-treatment Harvoni. Merck officials did not immediately respond to a request for the price of the new drug. The Merck drug’s FDA label says liver-related blood tests should be performed prior to starting therapy and at certain times during treatment. Gilead secured an early lead in the lucrative market for oral hepatitis C drugs - first with the $1,000-per-pill Sovaldi, and now Harvoni. AbbVie Inc followed in late 2014 with a multi-pill regimen. Nevertheless, AbbVie secured exclusive contracts with payers such as pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co, forcing Gilead to discount its own contract prices. Hepatitis C infects an estimated 3.2 million Americans. ",1282016,http://www.reuters.com/article/merck-co-hepatitis-fda/u-s-fda-approves-mercks-new-hepatitis-c-pill-idUSL2N15C2EO
887,MRK,"Bristol-Myers set to lead earnings parade in 2016, beyond","(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) on Thursday positioned itself as a potential earnings pacesetter in 2016, with a forecast of up to 19 percent growth that eclipses profit gains expected by most other large drugmakers. Bolstered by blistering sales of its Opdivo immuno-oncology drug and its Eliquis blood clot preventer, Bristol-Myers  expects earnings this year of $2.30 to $2.40 per share. It earned $2.01 per share last year. In contrast, Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) on Thursday predicted relatively flat 2016 earnings following strong gains last year, when sales of new cancer and diabetes drugs offset sharp declines in older medicines. Swiss rivals Roche Holding AG ROG.VX and Novartis AG NOVN.VX have also predicted flat 2016 earnings, while Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) expects growth of 3.6 percent to 6.2 percent, driven by sales of newer medicines. Merck & Co (MRK.N) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) have not yet provided 2016 earnings expectations, but Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S expects them next week to forecast growth of 4.2 percent and 8 percent, respectively. Bristol-Myers, whose $17 billion in annual sales are far below its industry peers, has downsized in recent years by selling off its diabetes drugs and cutting costs. “They’ve made courageous decisions to streamline expenses, and their reduced revenue base will also fuel earnings growth,” said Guggenheim Partners analyst Tony Butler. Ashtyn Evans, an analyst with Edward Jones, said she expects Opdivo eventually to generate annual sales of more than $8 billion. Half of Bristol-Myers’ revenue will likely come from Opdivo and other cancer drugs by 2020, Evans said, allowing the company to generate average annual earnings growth in the 20 percent range for the next three to five years. “Bristol is a lot different than it was just a few years ago,” Evans said, citing its razor focus on potentially lucrative immuno-oncology drugs, while also developing cardiovascular and anti-inflammation medicines. Sales of Eliquis, which Bristol-Myers markets with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), more than doubled to $602 million in the quarter. The pill was approved in 2012 to prevent blood clots among patients with an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation. Growing numbers of doctors are prescribing it as a safer and more-effective alternative to longstanding oral therapy warfarin. Bristol’s better-than-expected quarterly earnings were also due to soaring sales of Opdivo, a new treatment for melanoma, lung cancer and kidney cancer that is also being tested against other cancers. Sales of the injectable medicine, which was approved in late 2014 and works by taking the brakes off the immune system, jumped to $475 million.    The Princeton, New Jersey-based company said on Thursday it had halted a large trial of Opdivo after a monitoring committee concluded that head and neck cancer patients taking the drug survived longer than those taking standard chemotherapy. Analysts said Opdivo could pick up $1 billion in eventual sales for head and neck cancer, if it is approved for that indication.  Earlier on Thursday, Roche spooked investors by forecasting stagnant 2016 earnings. Analysts cited concern that growth could slow for Roche’s three big cancer treatments: Herceptin, Rituxan and Avastin. Novartis on Wednesday also forecast flat 2016 results, amid generic competition for its Gleevec leukemia drug and disappointing sales of new heart failure medicine, Entresto.

888,MRK,Payers see price leverage with entry of Merck hepatitis C drug,"Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. pharmacy benefit managers expect the launch of Merck & Co Inc’s new hepatitis C pill to improve their leverage in price negotiations with drugmakers. The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved Merck’s Zepatier for treatment of patients infected with the most common form of the liver-destroying virus, genotype 1, as well as the less common genotype 4. The list price for the new drug is $54,600 for a 12-week regimen - compared with $94,500 for Gilead Sciences Inc’s  Harvoni. A multi-pill regimen, Viekira Pak, from AbbVie Inc has a list price near $83,000. AbbVie in late 2014 secured an exclusive contract with Express Scripts Holding Co, the largest manager of U.S.  prescription drug plans, which forced Gilead to discount its own contract prices with a range of other payers. Merck said it priced Zepatier in line with net prices for competing drugs. “We look forward to working with Merck,” Express Scripts said in an emailed statement on Friday. “Having multiple, clinically effective options allows us to again leverage competition and make medicine more affordable for our clients while ensuring appropriate patient access.” No changes have been made as yet to Express Scripts’ preferred formulary, but Harvoni will be added to its Medicare formulary on March 1. CVS Health Corp, the No. 2 drug benefit manager, which now gives preferred status to Gilead’s hepatitis C drugs, said in an email that it is “employing a strategic assessment of the therapy landscape and engaging with drugmakers to evaluate options.” Shares of Gilead were down 5 percent at $83.00 in Friday Nasdaq trading - their lowest since June 2014. Merck shares were up 2 percent at $50.35 on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts estimate that Gilead, with $14 billion in hepatitis C drug sales for the first nine months of 2015, controls about 93 percent of the U.S. market, compared with AbbVie’s 7 percent. “Given Merck’s interest in participating in such a large market, we model and fully expect increased price competition and we also view Merck’s list price as a rational way to stay out of the drug pricing spotlight,” Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a research note. UBS has forecast that Merck will get 8 percent of the U.S.  genotype 1 market this year, rising to 15 percent in 2019. Both Zepatier and Viekira Pak require periodic liver function tests.

889,MRK,FDA approves Merck's new hepatitis C pill,"(Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Thursday approved a new once-daily pill for the liver-destroying hepatitis C virus made by Merck & Co Inc, which said it will sell the drug at a lower list price than its competitors. The list price for Zepatier will be $54,600 for a 12-week regimen, which Merck said it expects “to be in the range of net prices” for comparable treatments. Gilead Sciences Inc, which secured an early lead in the lucrative market for oral hepatitis C drugs with the $1,000-per-pill Sovaldi, currently sells an enhanced version of that drug as a single-tablet regimen called Harvoni at a list price of $94,500. AbbVie Inc followed in late 2014 with a multi-pill regimen. Nevertheless, AbbVie secured exclusive contracts with payers such as pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co, forcing Gilead to discount its own contract prices. Gilead has continued to dominate the market with hepatitis C drug sales of more than $14 billion in the first nine months of 2015. The Food and Drug Administration approved Zepatier, with or without the older antiviral drug ribavirin, for patients infected with the most common form of hepatitis C, genotype 1, as well as the less common genotype 4. The new drug’s FDA label says liver-related blood tests should be performed prior to starting therapy and at certain times during treatment. Clinical trials found that 12 or 16 weeks of treatment with Merck’s Zepatier reduced the virus to undetectable levels, which is considered a cure, in more than 94 percent of patients, the FDA said in a statement.

891,MRK,Merck gives cautious 2016 outlook as sales of top medicines lag,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) on Wednesday issued a cautious 2016 outlook and reported disappointing fourth-quarter sales of its Januvia diabetes treatment and its Remicade arthritis drug, sending its shares down nearly 3 percent.     Sales of Januvia and a related drug called Janumet, the company’s biggest franchise, fell 12 percent to $1.45 billion. Merck said wholesalers had stocked up in the prior quarter, and the products face growing competition from other oral diabetes treatments. But Adam Schechter, the company’s head of global human health, said Januvia sales should increase this year, excluding the effects of a stronger dollar, which reduces the value of revenue from overseas.  Januvia sales did not suffer after recent data showed Eli Lilly & Co’s (LLY.N) rival Jardiance drug sharply reduced deaths among diabetics at risk of heart attack, Schechter said. Sales of Remicade, which is facing competition outside the United States from cheaper biosimilars, dropped 29 percent to $396 million. In a conference call with analysts, Schechter said the drug’s market share was shrinking, and the trend would accelerate.   “Our initial read on the earnings and guidance reaffirms our neutral stance on (Merck) as pressure on key products such as Januvia and Remicade will likely limit near-term growth,” Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said. Merck is counting on Keytruda, a recently approved treatment for melanoma and lung cancer, to boost its earnings for years to come. The medicine, which takes the brakes off the immune system, is competing with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s (BMY.N) similar Opdivo treatment, which is picking up sales faster.     Keytruda sales rose to $214 million in the fourth quarter, about half Opdivo’s $475 million in revenue in that period.     Merck, the second-largest U.S. drugmaker behind Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), forecast full-year earnings of $3.60 to $3.75 per share, excluding special items. The analysts’ average estimate was $3.72, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.      Merck said it expected 2016 revenue of $38.7 billion to $40.2 billion. Wall Street had forecast $40.25 billion.     Fourth-quarter revenue fell 3 percent to $10.22 billion, below analysts’ expectations of $10.35 billion. Sales would have risen 4 percent if not for the stronger dollar. Net income fell to $976 million from $7.32 billion.     Excluding costs from last year’s acquisition of Cubist Pharmaceuticals and other special items, earnings of 93 cents per share topped Wall Street’s forecast of 91 cents.

895,MRK,Merck says U.S. FDA reject its claim that Zetia and Vytorin cut heart risk,"Feb 15 (Reuters) - Drugmaker Merck & Co Inc said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration declined to approve its claim that cholesterol-lowering drugs Zetia and Vytorin reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes in patients with coronary heart disease. The company said that after receiving a complete response letter from the FDA, it will review the letter and determine its next steps. Merck noted in a statement that both drugs are indicated to reduce LDL, or “bad,” cholesterol, but “The effect of Zetia on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.” The company said the FDA determined that Vytorin, which is a combination of Zetia and the cholesterol drug simvastatin, has no additional benefit on cardiovascular diseases beyond those already been established for simvastatin. The applications were based on the results of Merck’s Improve-IT study. The FDA’s decision follows a recommendation in December by one of its advisory committees that Merck should not be allowed to claim that Vytorin reduces the risk of heart attacks and strokes in patients with coronary heart disease.

The verdict in federal court in San Jose, California, is a major setback for Gilead, whose drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni brought in $19.2 billion in worldwide sales last year.

That issue will be argued in a separate non-jury trial before U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman starting next week. Gilead spokeswoman Michele Rest said the company does not believe Merck is entitled to any damages. “In the event the judge maintains the jury’s verdict, we will appeal,” she said. In a statement, Merck said, “We are pleased that the jury recognized that patent protections are essential to the development of new medical treatments.” In after-hours trading, Merck shares were down 50 cents to $52.57. Gilead shares gained slightly. Insurers, politicians and patient groups have denounced the list prices of the new drugs. Harvoni, at $1,125 per pill before discounts, costs $94,000 for a 12-week regimen. Gilead obtained the active ingredient in its drugs,   sofosbuvir, by acquiring Pharmasset, Inc in 2011. Merck said Pharmasset developed the chemical from a Merck patent that was filed in 2002. Gilead, meanwhile, said Merck’s patents were derived from Pharmasset’s work. After Merck, based in Kenilworth, New Jersey, demanded royalties in 2013, Gilead and Merck sued each other in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Last month, Freeman ruled that Gilead’s drugs infringe Merck’s patents. In calculating damages, jurors said they sought a middle ground. “We worked to get to something we could all agree so we weren’t hurting one side or the other,” juror Cody Shump, a 20-year-old San Jose resident, told Reuters.

910,MRK,Gilead says Merck 'deceitful' in hepatitis C drug patent fight,"By Andrew Chung Gilead Sciences Inc on Wednesday will attempt to wipe out $200 million in damages for infringing two Merck & Co patents with its blockbuster hepatitis C treatments by claiming that Merck was dishonest in obtaining the patents, an argument that attorneys say could be difficult to prove. A bench trial on Wednesday will pit Gilead’s Fish & Richardson attorneys against Merck’s lawyers from Williams & Connolly, on Gilead’s claim that Merck has “unclean hands” because it used Gilead’s technology in its own patent applications and so should be precluded from enforcing its patents. Merck says the jury has already found that its patents are valid, foreclosing any unclean hands defense.

916,MRK,UPDATE 1-Merck sex discrimination case could be collective action -judge,"(Reuters) - A federal judge has granted preliminary approval for a lawsuit accusing Merck & Co Inc(MRK.N) of underpaying female sales representatives to go forward as a collective action. The lawsuit is seeking at least $250 million in damages. U.S. District Judge Michael Shipp in Trenton, New Jersey, on Wednesday granted conditional certification to a proposed class of current and former representatives under the federal Equal Pay Act, which requires women and men to be paid equally for the same work. The complaint alleges that Merck systematically paid female sales representatives less than their male peers, denied them promotions and subjected them to sexual harassment and an otherwise hostile work environment. Employees who become pregnant or have children were often pressured to leave the company, the complaint says. A collective action under the Equal Pay Act requires potential class members to opt in, unlike a traditional class action in which class members must opt out. Shipp’s order allows notices to be sent to potential members so they can opt in. The class includes women who worked in certain sales representative positions going back to 2009. It would still require final approval later in the case for class members to win damages. However, Shipp ruled that the four former sales representatives who brought the lawsuit had already made a “modest factual showing” of how Merck’s policies affected them and other employees similarly. “We’re glad that women across the country are going to have an opportunity to join this case,” said Russell Kornblith, an attorney for the plaintiffs. “We remain confident that this case lacks merit,” Merck said in a statement emailed by spokeswoman Lainie Keller. “The company will continue to vigorously defend itself, and remains fully committed to providing equal employment opportunities for all employees.” The lawsuit, filed in 2013 in New Jersey U.S. District Court, also includes claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The plaintiffs are seeking to bring those claims as a class action, though no class has yet been certified. The case is Smith et al v.

922,MRK,"RPT-UPDATE 2-Merck sales disappoint as Januvia, Remicade fall short","(Repeats to show photo availability) By Ransdell Pierson May 5 (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc on Thursday reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue, hurt by disappointing sales of its Januvia diabetes treatment and Remicade arthritis drug. But the second-largest U.S. drugmaker beat first-quarter earnings forecasts because of cost controls and a weakening dollar, and it slightly raised its full-year profit outlook. Combined sales of Januvia and a related combination medicine called Janumet edged up 1 percent to $1.41 billion, $30 million shy of Wall Street expectations. Demand for the drugs, Merck’s biggest franchise and former sparkplugs for company growth, has waned due to new competition, including from Eli Lilly & Co’s  Jardiance and other members of a family of medicines called SGLT-2 inhibitors. Remicade sales fell 30 percent to $349 million, $25 million below forecasts. The injectable treatment for rheumatoid arthritis faces escalating competition in Europe from cheaper biosimilars. A bright spot in the earnings report was Keytruda, a new cancer treatment that works by taking the brakes off the immune system. Its sales rose to $249 million from $83 million a year earlier, slightly above expectations. But Keytruda sales are ramping up more slowly than those of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s similar new immuno-oncology product called Opdivo, which also treats melanoma and lung cancer and is being tested for an array of other types of cancer. Its sales jumped to $704 million in the quarter. For Merck, “pressure on important marketed products such as Januvia and Remicade will likely limit near-term growth opportunities” and offset faster-growing products like Keytruda, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said in a research note. Sales of animal health products were flat at $829 million, about $20 million below Wall Street forecasts, but would have risen 9 percent if not for the weakening dollar, which reduces sales outside the United States, Merck said. Total revenue slipped 1 percent to $9.31 billion, below the average estimate of $9.46 billion among analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income rose to $1.12 billion, or 40 cents per share, from $953 million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, Merck earned 89 cents per share,  beating Wall Street expectations by 4 cents. Merck raised its full-year earnings forecast to a range of $3.65 to $3.77 per share from its prior outlook of $3.60 to$3.75. It increased the low end of its sales forecast to $39.0 billion from $38.7 billion while keeping the top end at $40.2 billion.

930,MRK,Gilead escapes liability in hepatitis C patent fight with Merck,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday found a pattern of misconduct by Merck & Co including lying under oath and other unethical practices, freeing Gilead Sciences Inc  from paying any damages for infringing Merck’s patents with its lucrative treatments for hepatitis C, Sovaldi and Harvoni. The dramatic ruling comes after a federal jury in San Jose, California, on March 24 ordered Gilead to pay $200 million in damages, based on findings that Merck’s patents were valid. U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead proved that in the process of applying for its patents, Merck deceptively used confidential information from Pharmasset, Inc, a company Gilead bought in 2011. Freeman also said Merck cannot enforce the patents because Merck’s own lawyer gave inconsistent and untruthful testimony during the trial. “Merck’s acts are even more egregious because the main perpetrator of its misconduct was its attorney,” she said. In a statement, Merck spokeswoman Lainie Keller said Gilead’s allegations against the patents are without merit and the company would appeal. “The judge’s ruling does not reflect the facts of this case.” Gilead feels “vindicated” by the decision, spokeswoman Michele Rest said. Gilead had also been facing a demand from Merck for an ongoing royalty of at least 12 percent of all future sales of the drugs, according to court papers. Gilead made $23 billion on the two pills in the U.S. alone over the last two years. Pharmaceutical firms such as Merck, which recently launched its own hepatitis C drug, Zepatier, are trying to chip away at Gilead’s dominant position in the market for a new generation of drugs, which cure the liver disease in well over 90 percent of patients. Some policy makers and insurers have criticized their costs. Harvoni, for instance, lists at $1,125 per pill before discounts and $94,000 for a 12-week regimen. The case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming ownership of laboratory work underlying sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead’s drugs. After the jury verdict, Freeman separately dealt with Foster City, California-based Gilead’s accusations of Merck’s unethical conduct in obtaining the patents. Merck, based in Kenilworth, New Jersey, countered that it had already known of the technology Gilead claimed was Pharmasset’s. Merck’s partner in the suit and co-owner of the patents, Ionis Pharmaceuticals Inc, stood to receive 20 percent of any damages awarded Merck.

937,MRK,Merck's Keytruda prolongs life in big lung-cancer study,"(Reuters) - Advanced lung cancer patients who took Merck & Co Inc’s Keytruda immuno-oncology medicine in a large trial and were previously untreated went longer without their disease worsening and showed a survival advantage over those given standard chemotherapy, the drugmaker said on Thursday. An independent data monitoring board recommended that the late-stage trial be stopped due to the favorable results, Merck said, thereby allowing patients who were taking chemotherapy to switch over to the company’s treatment. Keytruda, which takes the brakes off the immune system by blocking a protein called PD-1, is already approved for patients who have undergone previous chemotherapy for advanced non-small lung cancer. Patients enrolled in the trial had tumors with high levels of PD-L1, a related protein whose presence may help identify which patients are most likely to respond to Keytruda and similar drugs called checkpoint inhibitors.    Merck hopes the new data will allow its injectable drug, which has a list price of about $150,000 a year, to be used earlier as a treatment for the most common form of lung cancer. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s approved rival Opdivo is also being tested as a so-called first line treatment for NSCLC, with data expected later this year. Opdivo’s studies have enrolled patients regardless of their PD-L1 levels, helping assure its wider use and greater sales than Keytruda. John Boris, an analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, on Thursday forecast that Keytruda will generate annual sales of $7 billion by 2021. But he predicted Keytruda will have only 25 to 30 percent of the first-line NSCLC market, while Opdivo commands a 65 to 70 percent market share. Shares of Merck rose 2.1 percent in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, amid slight gains for the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index of large drugmakers.

964,MRK,"Merck quarterly results beat forecasts, shares rise","(Reuters) - Merck & Co (MRK.N) reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings, fueled by sales of its new Keytruda immuno-oncology drug and Januvia diabetes treatment, sending its shares up 2 percent in premarket trading.        The second-biggest U.S. drugmaker said revenue grew 1 percent in the second quarter to $9.84 billion, above analysts’ average estimate of $9.78 billion.     Keytruda, a recently approved treatment for melanoma and lung cancer that Merck is counting on to boost its earnings for years to come, posted sales of $314 million, about $20 million more than analysts had forecast.      The medicine, which takes the brakes off the immune system, is competing with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s (BMY.N) similar Opdivo treatment. They belong to a new family of medicines called PD-1 inhibitors. Keytruda was approved in October 2015 for patients with advanced lung cancer who had failed to benefit from previous treatments. A recent clinical trial suggested Keytruda is also effective in previously untreated patients, spurring hopes U.S. regulators will soon expand approved use of the drug to that far larger population.         Combined sales of Januvia and a related diabetes drug called Janumet rose 2 percent to $1.63 billion, topping forecasts by about $56 million.  But the medicines, facing growing competition, are no longer big earnings drivers for Merck. Merck’s new Zepatier treatment for hepatitis C, which has been on the U.S. market for about six months, contributed $112 million in sales during the quarter. Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said growing sales of newer drugs like Keytruda and Zepatier will likely be offset by future declines for older products, including Januvia and cholesterol fighters, Vytorin and Zetia.  He has a “neutral” rating on the drugmaker. But J.P.Morgan analyst Chris Schott maintained his “overweight” rating on Merck, citing confidence in prospects for Keytruda, which is also being studied for many other types of cancer.  Merck earned $1.21 billion, or 43 cents per share, in the quarter. That compared with $688 million, or 24 cents per share, in the year-earlier period, when Merck took charges for its acquisition of Cubist Pharmaceuticals.     Excluding special items, the company earned 93 cents per share, ahead of the average analyst estimate of 91 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Nanoco has been hunting for a new licensing deal for the past few months since it switched from exclusive to non-exclusive its deal with Dow Chemical Co for commercial production of quantum dots to be used in digital displays. Under the license, Merck would be able to immediately start marketing Nanoco’s cadmium-free quantum dots and ultimately establish its own production facility, Nanoco said in a statement on Monday. The British firm did not disclose the financial details of the deal, but said it would receive a licence fee and royalties on Merck’s sales of the Nanoco cadmium-free quantum dots manufactured. Quantum dots are semiconductor crystals 10,000 times finer than a human hair. They convert electrical energy into light and can be manipulated to produce precise colours, and are mostly used in television sets.

Shares of Ford (F.N) and General Motors (GM.N) dropped more than 4 percent each after the two major U.S. automakers reported July vehicle sales slightly below expectations. The automakers’ declines pulled the S&P; consumer discretionary sector .SPLRCD down 1.5 percent as the worst- performing of the 10 major S&P; groups.

That could keep the central bank on a cautious path to hiking interest rates.  “People are starting to see that things aren’t quite as rosy as they might have thought in the month of July with that big run up,” said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. The S&P; 500 climbed 3.6 percent in July, its best month since March.

977,MRK,Bristol-Myers' Opdivo fails lung cancer trial; shares plunge,"(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said its blockbuster Opdivo immunotherapy failed to slow progression of symptoms in previously untreated patients with advanced lung cancer, a major setback expected to benefit Merck & Co’s rival medicine. Shares of Bristol-Myers fell almost 16 percent to $63.54 on Friday after the company announced failure of the late-stage trial. Shares of Merck gained 8.7 percent to $62.89.  “This is the worst-case scenario” for Opdivo and Bristol-Myers, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a research note. “There appears to be no silver lining.” Opdivo had been considered the clear leader in a costly new class of medicines called checkpoint inhibitors that work by taking the brakes off the immune system. Its second-quarter sales of $840 million were more than double those of Merck’s Keytruda.  Opdivo won approval in March 2015 for treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who had previously failed to benefit from chemotherapy. Six months later, Keytruda received approval for a similar patient population.  Meanwhile, both companies raced to complete large trials to see if their drugs, which each cost about $150,000 a year, would also benefit patients who had never previously been treated for the most common form of lung cancer. The trials compared the drugs against chemotherapy. “Obviously the results of this trial are disappointing,” Bristol-Myers Chief Executive Giovanni Caforio said in an interview, saying that the data suggests there is no role in the foreseeable future for Opdivo as a standalone medicine for previously untreated lung cancer. Patients in the Opdivo trial had tumors with low levels of PD-L1, a protein whose presence may help identify those most likely to benefit from checkpoint inhibitors. Those in the successful Merck trial, by contrast, were only enrolled if they were shown to have high levels of PD-L1 and represented a smaller percentage of the lung cancer population. Caforio said the best hope now for Opdivo in front-line treatment of lung cancer is combination therapy. The company is conducting a late-stage study with more than 2,000 patients in which Opdivo will be combined with Bristol-Myers’ other approved immunotherapy, Yervoy. The data is expected by early 2018. “That study will provide the definitive answer of the role of combination immunotherapy in the front-line lung cancer setting,” he said. Data in June from a large clinical study showed Keytruda was effective in newly treated patients, not only in delaying progression of lung cancer symptoms but also in prolonging survival. The trial was stopped so that all patients could receive Keytruda. The data spurred hopes that U.S. regulators would soon expand approved use of the Merck drug. Complete data for the study has not yet been released.  Now that Bristol-Myers’ drug has failed in that effort, Merck’s medicine could have a better chance to catch up with Opdivo’s far larger sales.  Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said Opdivo, Keytruda and similar drugs in development had been expected to capture peak annual combined sales of $10 billion to $15 billion from lung cancer, with Bristol-Myers winning the lion’s share. “Today’s news very much helps level the playing field and is a major boost for Merck,” Anderson said in a research note. Opdivo and Keytruda are also approved to treat advanced melanoma and are being studied against a wide range of other types of cancer.

Those in the successful Merck trial, by contrast, were only enrolled if they were shown to have high levels of PD-L1 and represented a smaller percentage of the lung cancer population. Caforio said the best hope now for Opdivo in front-line treatment of lung cancer is combination therapy. The company is conducting a late-stage study with more than 2,000 patients in which Opdivo will be combined with Bristol-Myers’ other approved immunotherapy, Yervoy. The data is expected by early 2018. “That study will provide the definitive answer of the role of combination immunotherapy in the front-line lung cancer setting,” he said. Data in June from a large clinical study showed Keytruda was effective in newly treated patients, not only in delaying progression of lung cancer symptoms but also in prolonging survival. The trial was stopped so that all patients could receive Keytruda. The data spurred hopes that U.S. regulators would soon expand approved use of the Merck drug. Complete data for the study has not yet been released.  Now that Bristol-Myers’ drug has failed in that effort, Merck’s medicine could have a better chance to catch up with Opdivo’s far larger sales.  Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said Opdivo, Keytruda and similar drugs in development had been expected to capture peak annual combined sales of $10 billion to $15 billion from lung cancer, with Bristol-Myers winning the lion’s share. “Today’s news very much helps level the playing field and is a major boost for Merck,” Anderson said in a research note. Opdivo and Keytruda are also approved to treat advanced melanoma and are being studied against a wide range of other types of cancer.

979,MRK,"AstraZeneca hits 2014 Pfizer bid price, helped by Bristol's woes","LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (AZN.L) shares hit a record high on Friday, breaching for the first time the 55 pounds a share level offered by Pfizer (PFE.N) in 2014 during the U.S. group’s abortive $100 billion attempt to buy the drugmaker. The British firm’s stock has been on a roll recently, helped by a falling pound and speculation that Switzerland’s Novartis (NOVN.S) might be next to launch a bid. However, the shares were lifted to a high of 55.05 pounds by the misfortunes of Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N). The failure of Bristol’s immunotherapy drug Opdivo to slow disease progression in previously untreated patients with lung cancer as hoped was seen by investors as good news for rivals Merck & Co (MRK.N) and AstraZeneca. Analysts at Leerink, Jefferies and Deutsche Bank said the negative result with Opdivo increased the potential market opportunity for AstraZeneca’s keenly watched combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab. Crucial clinical trial results with durvalumab, both on its own and in combination with tremelimumab, are due next year. Chief Executive Pascal Soriot believes AstraZeneca can become a major player in cancer drugs that bolster the immune system. And its ability to carve out billions of dollars in potential sales hinges not only on the effectiveness of its own products but on the competitive profile of rivals. Cancer is currently the hottest area of research across the drugs industry and some analysts believe this could make AstraZeneca a takeover target once again, with speculation turning last week to Novartis as a bidder.

996,MRK,UPDATE 1-Bayer raises sales targets for top-selling drugs after Monsanto deal,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German drugmaker Bayer (BAYGn.DE) said its two best-selling drugs had a higher annual peak sales potential than previously targeted, after the agreed $66 billion takeover of Monsanto (MON.N) stirred criticism it might neglect its pharmaceuticals business. Bayer now expects annual peak sales of more than 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) for stroke prevention pill Xarelto, jointly sold with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), where it had previously seen about 3.5 billion. For the eye medicine Eylea, jointly developed with Regeneron (REGN.O), it now sees peak sales potential of more than 2.5 billion euros, up from at least 1.5 billion previously. Also underpinned by cancer drug Xofigo and pulmonary hypertension treatment Adempas, the group’s prescription drugs unit aims to increase earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), adjusted for special items, to 32-34 percent of sales in 2018, up from 30.1 percent last year. The smaller animal health unit could also slightly increase margins, Bayer said. In consumer health, previously boosted by the acquisition of brands from Merck & Co (MRK.N), it now sees sales adjusted for currency swings growing by between 4 and 5 percent by the end of 2018 and an adjusted EBITDA margin of about 25 percent, up from 24 percent in 2015. Bayer has “underestimated the country risk from Emerging Markets volatility”, the company said in presentation slides. It also cited “stronger business disruption than anticipated during the integration of Merck Consumer Care and Dihon in China”, referring to a Chinese non-prescription drugs unit it acquired in 2014. “2018 EBITDA guidance for Pharma and Animal Health may ... offer some upside against consensus, though the consumer margin guidance may disappoint slightly,” Jefferies analysts said in a note to investors.

999,MRK,"'New day' in lung cancer as Merck drug shines, works with chemo","COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Merck & Co scored a double hit on Sunday with new clinical data showing its Keytruda immunotherapy offered big benefits in previously untreated lung cancer patients, either when given on its own or with chemotherapy. As a monotherapy, Keytruda halved the risk of disease progression and cut overall deaths by 40 percent compared to chemotherapy alone in pre-selected patients whose tumors had been tested using a biomarker. And when given with two older chemotherapy drugs in non-selected patients, it was almost twice as likely to shrink tumors as chemotherapy alone. Another similar drug from Roche also demonstrated broad efficacy as a so-called second-line option in patients who had received prior treatment. “Remember this day. It’s a new day for lung cancer treatment,” Stefan Zimmermann of Lausanne’s University Hospital told reporters at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress as the results were presented. An editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, where the Merck monotherapy results were published, said Keytruda could become “a new standard of care”.    The various findings suggest that treating lung cancer - the biggest cancer killer globally - with powerful new immune system-boosting medicines is going to involve more permutations than some experts originally expected. Rival drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb had tried a catch-all approach with its Opdivo drug but it failed to help previously untreated patients when given on its own in a trial that included people with low levels of a protein called PD-L1. Keytruda, as a sole agent, was targeted only at patients with high PD-L1, making them more receptive to immunotherapy. Lead researcher Martin Reck of Germany’s Lung Clinic Grosshansdorf predicted that testing for the PD-L1 biomarker would now become standard “from today”. U.S. regulators are expected to decide whether to approve Keytruda for first-line non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type, by Dec. 24.  Merck had already said in June that Keytruda worked in the trial but the scale of the benefit was only disclosed at ESMO. The second trial, mixing Keytruda with chemotherapy, was much smaller but was notable because it was the first time that a combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy has been shown to work in a randomized Phase II study. Many experts have been skeptical about this approach and investors’ expectations, up until now, have been quite low. In the event, researchers reported that Merck’s combination cut the risk of disease progression or death by 47 percent compared to chemotherapy alone after 10.6 months, while 55 percent of patients saw their tumors shrink versus 29 percent. Patients in this trial were not selected by PD-L1 expression but the study did find that those with higher PD-L1 had a higher response. Roger Perlmutter, Merck’s head of research, said both trials suggested Keytruda could offer a broad array of patients meaningful improvement over standard platinum-based chemotherapy, which is now more than two decades old. Drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo work by taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body’s natural killer cells to home in on tumors. They are expected to sell tens of billions of dollars in the years ahead, with lung cancer the largest market. Up until now, Bristol has dominated the field but investors have started to shift their bets, with forecasts for Opdivo declining while those for Keytruda have risen. The current consensus forecast among analysts is for Keytruda sales to reach $8 billion in 2021, with Opdivo selling $10.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Results of Bristol’s failed Opdivo trial, which included patients with tumors testing only 5 percent or higher for PD-L1 against the 50 percent cut-off used by Merck, were also presented at ESMO. These showed progression-free survival was 4.2 months with Opdivo and 5.9 months with chemotherapy, although the difference was not statistically significant. Overall survival was 14.4 months with Opdivo versus 13.2 months.  The failure of Opdivo to work for “all comers” in lung cancer was first announced in August, without any details. It was a major setback for Bristol, wiping out around a quarter of the company’s market value, and it has caused investors to rethink prospects for immunotherapy treatments. Many now believe that combination therapy is the way ahead, with Bristol and AstraZeneca working primarily on using two immunotherapies together, while Roche and Merck look at adding chemotherapy.

1002,MRK,UPDATE 1-Bristol lung-cancer setback puts rival Merck drug in driver seat,"(Reuters) - New data is likely to prompt doctors to abandon Bristol-Myers Squibb’s immunotherapy Opdivo in favor of Merck & Co’s rival Keytruda in a large segment of the lucrative lung cancer market, analysts said on Monday.    The results of a closely watched clinical trial sent Bristol’s shares plunging 10 percent.    The data, presented at a medical meeting on Sunday, showed that lung cancer patients fared worse on Opdivo than those on chemotherapy. Merck shares rose nearly 2 percent on strong benefits shown by Keytruda in a similar late-stage lung cancer study.  Both trials tested the drugs that help the immune system to recognize and fight cancer as an initial treatment for advanced lung cancer. They are already approved for patients whose disease had progressed following chemotherapy, but approval as a so called first-line therapy could greatly increase the number of patients taking them. Opdivo had been considered the leader among the new class of medicines. It generated $840 million of sales in the second quarter, more than double those of Keytruda. The view of the rival drugs began to change in August, with the surprise announcement by Bristol-Myers that Opdivo had failed to best older chemotherapies in the Phase III trial. Details of the trial unveiled at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Copenhagen only heightened those   concerns. Patients on Opdivo went 4.2 months before their disease worsened versus 5.9 months for those on chemo, although the difference was not deemed statistically significant. “This data represented a worst-case scenario for Opdivo,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note.  The Opdivo trial enrolled patients regardless of their tumor’s level of PD-L1 expression, a protein targeted by the drug whose presence may help identify those most likely to benefit from treatment with the new medicines. Meanwhile, researchers reported that Keytruda halved the risk of disease progression in previously untreated patients, and cut overall deaths by 40 percent compared to chemotherapy. Patients in the Merck trial were only enrolled if they were shown to have high levels of PD-L1, a narrower segment of the lung cancer population than those in the Bristol-Myers study. “Merck will completely ‘own’ the segment of first-line lung cancer patients who have high PD-L1 expression levels, and Bristol Myers will capture nothing really,” Anderson said. Doctors are allowed to prescribe medicines for not yet approved uses, but analysts said they expect current off-label prescribing of Opdivo in first-line lung cancer to dry up now. In addition, competition in second-line lung cancer is soon expected to intensify with the anticipated approval of Roche’s immunotherapy Tecentriq, which is now approved to treat bladder cancer. Both Keytruda and Tecentriq are given every three weeks, while Opdivo is administered every two weeks, which is seen as a convenience disadvantage.   “The nearly inexplicable failure of (Opdivo) at every level of PD-L1 expression ... puts Merck in the driver’s seat in first-line lung cancer for at least the next 12-18 months,” said Leerink Partners analyst Seamus Fernandez. Calling the Keytruda data “stunning,” Fernandez said, “We fully expect Merck to retain a significant place at the table long term.”    Bristol shares, which had already lost one quarter of their value since the initial trial data was disclosed in August, fell 10 percent $49.85, while Merck shares were up 1.7 percent at $63.84 after earlier rising more than 3 percent to a near 15-year high. Opdivo is also approved for advanced melanoma, kidney cancer and a type of Hodgkin lymphoma, while Keytruda is also approved for advanced melanoma, plus head and neck cancer. But lung cancer is considered by far the biggest market for cancer drugs.

1004,MRK,Bristol lung-cancer setback puts rival Merck drug in driver seat,"(Reuters) - New data is likely to prompt doctors to abandon Bristol-Myers Squibb’s immunotherapy Opdivo in favor of Merck & Co’s rival Keytruda in a large segment of the lucrative lung cancer market, analysts said on Monday.    The results of a closely watched clinical trial sent Bristol’s shares plunging 10 percent.    The data, presented at a medical meeting on Sunday, showed that lung cancer patients fared worse on Opdivo than those on chemotherapy. Merck shares rose nearly 2 percent on strong benefits shown by Keytruda in a similar late-stage lung cancer study.  Both trials tested the drugs that help the immune system to recognize and fight cancer as an initial treatment for advanced lung cancer. They are already approved for patients whose disease had progressed following chemotherapy, but approval as a so called first-line therapy could greatly increase the number of patients taking them. Opdivo had been considered the leader among the new class of medicines. It generated $840 million of sales in the second quarter, more than double those of Keytruda. The view of the rival drugs began to change in August, with the surprise announcement by Bristol-Myers that Opdivo had failed to best older chemotherapies in the Phase III trial. Details of the trial unveiled at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Copenhagen only heightened those   concerns. Patients on Opdivo went 4.2 months before their disease worsened versus 5.9 months for those on chemo, although the difference was not deemed statistically significant. “This data represented a worst-case scenario for Opdivo,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note.  The Opdivo trial enrolled patients regardless of their tumor’s level of PD-L1 expression, a protein targeted by the drug whose presence may help identify those most likely to benefit from treatment with the new medicines. Meanwhile, researchers reported that Keytruda halved the risk of disease progression in previously untreated patients, and cut overall deaths by 40 percent compared to chemotherapy. Patients in the Merck trial were only enrolled if they were shown to have high levels of PD-L1, a narrower segment of the lung cancer population than those in the Bristol-Myers study. “Merck will completely ‘own’ the segment of first-line lung cancer patients who have high PD-L1 expression levels, and Bristol Myers will capture nothing really,” Anderson said.

In addition, competition in second-line lung cancer is soon expected to intensify with the anticipated approval of Roche’s immunotherapy Tecentriq, which is now approved to treat bladder cancer.

1011,MRK,UPDATE 2-Roche bets on new cancer drugs to offset patent expiries,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Roche said on Thursday strong sales of new medicines like cancer immunotherapy drug Tecentriq would help to sustain the company’s growth as patents on older drugs start to expire. Chief Executive Severin Schwan is betting he can stay ahead of the sales erosion with new medicines that include five launched in 2016 alone. “That is an unprecedented number of launches of new medicines in a short period of time,” Schwan said on a conference call after Roche reported third-quarter sales figures. “Our product pipeline is developing very well.” The Swiss drugmaker’s three established cancer blockbusters Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin, which account for annual sales of nearly 20 billion Swiss francs ($21 billion), all face biosimilar competition by the end of the decade. But so far this year, Tecentriq has won approval for bladder and lung cancer, Alecensa for lung cancer, Cotellic for skin cancer and Venclaxta for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Roche’s multiple sclerosis drug Ocrevus is slated for U.S. approval before the year is over. Tecentriq has brought in 77 million Swiss francs ($78 million) since its U.S. approval in May for bladder cancer. That revenue is due to accelerate after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration this week gave the a green light for the drug to be used against lung cancer.  Analysts are counting on it, too, as revenue growth from broad-based cancer drug Avastin, Rituxan for blood cancer, and breast cancer therapy Herceptin begins to slow. All three missed analyst expectations in the third quarter, and Avastin in particular, which fell 3 percent in the third quarter, led by a decline in the United States.  Overall, quarterly sales at the world’s biggest maker of cancer drugs rose 3 percent to 12.48 billion francs, missing the average estimate of 12.68 billion in a Reuters poll of analysts. “The momentum seems weakening in the haematology and breast cancer franchises in the U.S. and Japanese territories,” Bruno Bulic, an analyst at Baader Helvea, said. “We see the entry of Tecentriq coming timely.” He has a “buy” recommendation on Roche’s shares. They fell 0.2 percent by 0930 GMT, in line with the decline of the European health care sector index. Schwan still expected Roche’s 2016 sales to grow by a low- to mid-single digit percentage rate at constant exchange rates, with core earnings rising faster than sales. The company also confirmed its full-year outlook. He declined to comment on Novartis’s efforts to sell its $14 billion stake in Roche, saying any disposal was a matter for his cross-town rival to resolve. Novartis Chief Executive Joe Jimenez has said he may sell the stake without demanding a premium.

1012,MRK,Merck's Keytruda succeeds in key bladder cancer trial,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc said its immunotherapy, Keytruda, helped previously treated patients with advanced bladder cancer live longer in a late-stage study, prompting an independent monitoring panel to recommend stopping the trial early. The blockbuster drug’s benefit in patients with urothelial cancer, the most common form of bladder cancer, surpassed that of chemotherapy, meeting the main study goal of overall survival. Bladder cancer occurs when cells in the urinary bladder start to grow uncontrollably. Urothelial carcinoma starts in the cells lining the bladder. Patients enrolled in the trial suffered from an advanced form of the cancer despite undergoing chemotherapy. Keytruda, which belongs to a new class of medicines called PD-1 inhibitors that help the immune system unmask hidden cancer cells, generated second-quarter sales of $314 million. The drug, along with rival Bristol-Myers Squibb & Co’s Opdivo, is already approved to treat a common form of lung cancer. Analysts expect that the treatments will rake in tens of billions of dollars in sales in the years ahead, as they are tested for other types of cancer. A newer entrant to the immunotherapy space is Roche Holding AG, whose drug Tecentriq won U.S. approval in May for bladder cancer, followed by lung cancer this week.

1017,MRK,UPDATE 1-GSK files potential $1 bln shingles vaccine for U.S. approval,"LONDON (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline has filed its shingles vaccine Shingrix for U.S. regulatory approval, the drugmaker said on Monday, bringing the potential $1 billion-a-year seller a step closer to market. Shingrix is viewed by analysts as among the British company’s most promising experimental products, since it has shown greater protection among older recipients than Merck & Co’s rival shot Zostavax. GSK itself highlighted Shingrix as one of its top near-term pipeline hopes last November, during its first research and development day in more than a decade. The company, which will see Emma Walmsley take over as chief executive in 2017, is seeking to revitalise a drug portfolio hit by falling sales of best-selling inhaled lung treatment Advair. In clinical trials, GSK’s vaccine remained 90 percent effective in people over age 70, even four years after injections. Zostavax efficacy, by contrast, varies between 18 and 70 percent, and it declines noticeably in older people. People who are 70 years or older are often most at risk from shingles, a painful, itchy rash that results from the reactivation of latent chickenpox virus. The impressive trial results should put Shingrix in a strong competitive position, analysts believe, even though it requires two doses, against just one for Zostavax, and it is also linked to more injection site reactions. Analysts, on average, predict that worldwide sales of Shingrix will reach 856 million pounds ($1.05 billion) in 2021, according to consensus forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters. Sales of Zostavax, the only shingles vaccine on the market at present, totalled $749 million in 2015. GSK’s vaccine contains a component from U.S. biotech firm Agenus, which is entitled to royalties on future sales.  GSK said it planned to file Shingrix for European and Canadian approval before the end of this year, with Japan following in 2017.

1018,MRK,UPDATE 3-Merck predicts lung cancer dominance for Keytruda immunotherapy,"Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue due to higher sales of its vaccines and cancer drug Keytruda, which won an early U.S. approval on Monday for use in previously untreated lung cancer patients. Shares of Merck, which also raised its full-year profit and revenue forecasts, were up 1.23 percent at $61.50 in premarket trading on Tuesday. The second-largest U.S. drugmaker is betting on Keytruda to boost earnings as expectations for the drug have been building since its success in treating selected untreated patients. The approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration confirms Merck’s leading position in the hot area of medicines that fight tumors by harnessing the body’s immune system.

1019,MRK,"Merck quarterly revenue beats, raises full-year forecast","Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue due to higher sales of its vaccines and cancer drug Keytruda, which won an early U.S. approval on Monday for use in previously untreated lung cancer patients. Shares of Merck, which also raised its full-year profit and revenue forecasts, were up 1.23 percent at $61.50 in premarket trading on Tuesday. The second-largest U.S. drugmaker is betting on Keytruda to boost earnings as expectations for the drug have been building since its success in treating selected untreated patients. The approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration confirms Merck’s leading position in the hot area of medicines that fight tumors by harnessing the body’s immune system.

Under the simplified procedure, the Commission announces the clearance of uncontroversial first-stage mergers without giving any reason for its decision. Cases may be reclassified as non-simplified - that is, ordinary first-stage reviews - until they are approved.

1023,MRK,U.S. FDA approves Merck's lung cancer drug as first-line treatment,"Oct 24 (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc on Monday said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved its immunotherapy Keytruda for use in certain previously untreated lung cancer patients, making it the only approved first-line treatment. The drug has been approved for treating metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with high-levels of a protein known for suppressing the immune system called PD-L1. Keytruda works by taking the brakes off the immune system by blocking the interaction between PD-L1 and another protein, PD-1. The drug has already been approved for patients who have undergone previous chemotherapy for advanced non-small lung cancer. Monday’s announcement gives Merck the only approved first-line treatment for lung cancer, one of the biggest markets for cancer drugs. Rival Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s drug Opdivo failed a late-stage trial for the same indication. The approval was based on data from a late-stage study which showed Keytruda achieved superior progression-free and overall survival compared to chemotherapy in patients whose tumors expressed high levels of the protein, Merck said. Doctors are currently allowed to prescribe medicines for not yet approved uses but FDA’s approval of Keytruda could greatly increase the number of patients taking the drug. Shares of Kenilworth, New Jersey-based drugmaker fell 0.7 percent in aftermarket trade. Up to Monday’s close, the stock had gained more than 15 percent of its value year to date.

1025,MRK,Correction: Fitch Rates Merck's Euro Notes Offering 'A',,10272016,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSFit978493
1026,MRK,Fitch Rates Merck's Euro Notes Offering 'A',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 27 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to Merck &  Co., Inc.'s (MRK/Merck) euro notes offering. A complete list of ratings follows  at the end of this press release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The company's 'A' rating reflects the following: --Recently introduced therapies, an advancing pipeline and manageable patent  expiries should support intermediate- to long-term growth.  --Fitch believes that Merck will pursue targeted acquisitions as opposed to  large transformative ones. An improving pipeline and narrowing strategic focus  reduces the need to do big deals.  --Fitch expects Merck will continue favor share repurchases to deleveraging,  with the possibility of further debt-funded stock buybacks. --Fitch forecasts that Merck will generate solid FCF during the forecast period  supported by improving margins and moderate revenue growth. New Products/ Growth Opportunities: Products approved during the last three  years should help to drive intermediate- to long-term, top-line growth for  Merck. Most importantly, Keytruda (skin and lung cancer) is gaining traction in  the market, supported by an ongoing stream of clinical data, but facing  competition from a Bristol-Myers product and potentially similar drugs that may  receive approval during the next few years. Merck is also evaluating Keytruda's  safety and efficacy in other cancers and in combination with other oncolytics.  Bridion (post-surgical recovery), Belsomra (insomnia), Grastek (allergies) and  Rawitek (allergies) are unique-acting therapies, which should provide these two  drugs competitive positions. Zontivitiy (cardiovascular) and Zepatier (hepatitis  C) have entered increasingly crowded segments but should be able to gain some  share from both newer and older treatments. Expanding Late-Stage Pipeline: Fitch expects Merck to continue to build its  late-stage pipeline with new molecular entities (NMEs) to treat cancers,  bacterial and viral infections, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, central  nervous afflictions, osteoporosis, and other diseases. While the majority of  these projects are internally developed, Merck has partnered with other  innovator firms to take advantage of technological advancements that were  discovered externally. The landscape for drug development is expanding,  particularly as developers learn more about how genetics influence the  development, prevention and treatment of disease. As such, Fitch believes that  it is responsible and strategically advantageous for firms to look externally as  well as internally regarding new drug development. Patent Exposure Manageable: The company has and will continue to face some  significant patent expiries during the next year, but Fitch views the risk as  manageable with roughly 18% of total firm sales are at risk. In addition,  Remicade, which accounts for about 4.2% of total firm sales, is a biologic that  has experienced less rapid sales losses to generic competition compared to  traditional small-molecule pharmaceuticals. Vytorin and Zetia, however, are  small molecules and account for roughly 10% of total revenues. Fitch expects  these two products will lose significant sales shortly after their patents  expire, as is typically the case for small-molecule drugs. Solid Free Cash Flow Expected: Fitch forecasts that Merck will generate $5.7  billion - $5.9 billion in free cash flow (FCF) during 2016. Improving margins  driven by an improving sales mix and strong cost control should more than offset  expected soft near-term, top-line growth. Fitch expects FCF to incrementally  increase during the multi-year forecast period. Targeted Acquisition Most Likely: Fitch looks for Merck to pursue mainly  targeted acquisitions in the intermediate term. The company has improved its  operational and financial prospects through successfully gaining regulatory  approvals on late-stage pipeline projects and has continued to back fill its  pipeline with new and advancing projects. An improved growth and profitability  profile decreases the need for the company to execute large strategic business  combinations. Share Repurchases to Continue: Fitch assumes continued shareholder friendly  actions during the near term, some of which the company may fund with debt.  Merck has occasionally funded its share repurchases with debt. During 2015, the  company purchased a net $3.7 billion of its common stock, compared to $6.1  billion during the prior LTM period. The repurchases were executed under a $15  billion program authorized in May 2013 as well as an additional $10 billion  authorized in March 2015. As of June 30, 2016, the 2013 allotment was fully  utilized, with $6.9 billion remaining on the $10 billion extension. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Merck's 'A' rating include  the following: --Incrementally increasing revenue during the forecast period, driven by newer  products, largely offset in the near term by foreign exchange headwinds and  select product patent expirations.  --EBITDA operating margin improvement driven by a focus on costs and an  improving sales mix.  --Annual FCF (cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures minus  dividends) of roughly $5.9 billion during 2016. --Targeted acquisitions prioritized over strategic, transformative transactions. --Continued significant share repurchases. --Leverage to range between 1.7x - 1.9x during the next two years. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include the following: --Improving operations including new product development that support long-term  positive revenue growth and margin stability/increases; --An operational profile that would consistently generate significantly positive  FCF; --Cash deployment strategy that maintains gross debt leverage below 1.7x,  including managing through operational stress such as patent expiries. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include the following: --Material and lasting deterioration in operations and FCF, possibly driven by  patent expiries not being offset by new product development; --Leveraging acquisitions without the prospect of timely debt/leverage  reduction; --Persistent leverage above 2.2x. LIQUIDITY Adequate Liquidity: Fitch looks for Merck to maintain adequate liquidity through  strong FCF generation and ample access to the credit markets. FCF for the LTM  ending June 30, 2016 was $4.7 billion. At the end of the period, Merck had  approximately $11.8 billion in cash/short-term investments (U.S.: 10% - 20% of  total balances/OUS: 80% - 90% of total balances) and full availability on its $6  billion revolver, maturing in August 2019.  Manageable Debt Maturities: As of June 30, 2016, the company had $24.1 billion  in debt outstanding, with $234 million maturing in 2016, $317 million in 2017,  $3 billion in 2018 and $1.3 billion in 2019. Fitch expects near- to mid-term  maturities will be satisfied primarily through refinancing in the public debt  markets.

1027,MRK,UPDATE 5-Drugmakers under fire for possible U.S. price fixing,"(Reuters) - Two prominent U.S. lawmakers on Thursday called on federal antitrust regulators to probe whether Sanofi SA, Eli Lilly and Co, Merck & Co Inc and Novo Nordisk A/S colluded to set prices for insulin and other diabetes drugs. The request by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Elijah Cummings follows a similar letter they sent last fall calling for an investigation into 14 drug companies over price increases of generic drugs. U.S. prosecutors could file the first charges by the end of the year in their subsequent criminal investigation of generic drugmakers over suspected price collusion, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. (bloom.bg/2e6cZjF) A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. In their latest letter to the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, Sanders, an independent, and Cummings, a Democrat, raised questions about skyrocketing prices for insulin, and included a chart showing that many of the price spikes appeared to occur in tandem. They noted that the original patent on insulin, a hormone used by diabetics to control blood sugar levels, expired 75 years ago. Sanofi spokeswoman Ashleigh Koss said in an emailed statement that “Sanofi sets the prices of our treatments independently.” Novo Nordisk also said it sets prices “independently” and said it stands by its business practices. A spokeswoman for Merck said the company does not make insulin. Merck makes other products to treat diabetes. Eli Lilly, in an email, said it strongly disagrees with the accusations in the letter. “The insulin market in the U.S. is highly competitive,” the pharmaceutical company said. Shares of several generic drugmakers fell on Thursday after the report of pending Justice Department charges. Mylan N.V. closed down 6.9 percent, Allergan Plc fell 4.5 percent and Endo International Plc dropped 19.5 percent. Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc Ltd, which recently acquired Allergan’s generics business, fell 9.5 percent. “We do not think the major generic companies have likely participated in significant pricing collusion,” A/B Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal said in a research note.    Several generic drugmakers, including Mylan, Allergan, Endo and Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, had previously disclosed that they were subpoenaed in connection with the antitrust investigation by the Justice Department. Bloomberg said the probe spans more than a dozen companies and about two dozen drugs, citing people familiar with the matter. Impax Laboratories Inc said earlier this year that the Justice Department had requested information on four drugs: blood pressure pill digoxin, asthma drug terbutaline sulfate, prilocaine/lidocaine cream and calcipotriene solution, which is used to treat psoriasis. A spokesman from Teva said the company “is not aware of any facts that would give rise to an exposure to the company with respect to these subpoenas.” Officials at Endo and Lannett Company Inc did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Aggressive drug pricing has come under intense scrutiny after Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton tweeted her intent to tackle high prices last year. An August report from the Government Accountability Office found that more than 300 of 1,441 generic drugs analyzed had at least one price increase of 100 percent or more between the first quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2015. In February, Sanders and Cummings asked the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ enforcement arm to investigate generic drug price increases. Recent price hikes that have drawn fire included Turing Pharmaceuticals’ decision in 2015 to raise by 5,000 percent the price of a decades-old treatment for a dangerous parasitic infection. Generic drugmakers, possibly reacting to the political headwinds, reined in price hikes this year.  Guggenheim Securities, citing polling of generic drugmakers, last month estimated that overall U.S. generic drug prices would dip by a percentage in the mid-single digits this year. The price erosion has been felt by drug wholesalers like McKesson Corp and Amerisource Bergen Corp, which rely on price fluctuations for part of their profit margins.

1035,MRK,Merck wins UK okay for Keytruda in lung cancer after price cut,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s healthcare cost-effectiveness watchdog NICE has recommended use of Merck’s immunotherapy drug Keytruda in certain lung cancer patients, after the U.S. drugmaker cut the price further for the state-run health service. Keytruda is already approved as a cost-effective treatment in melanoma but the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) had initially blocked its use in lung cancer. “If companies work with us to price drugs reasonably and manage any uncertainties in the evidence base, we can continue to recommend patients have routine access to the treatments they need,” Carole Longson, director of the NICE centre for health technology evaluation, said in a statement on Friday. Keytruda has proved highly effective in fighting non-small cell lung cancer in patients with high levels of a protein called PD-L1, which makes them more receptive to immunotherapy.  The average cost of a course of treatment in Britain is around 29,000 pounds ($36,500) at the full list price but the National Health Service will pay less after getting a confidential discount.

1036,MRK,Merck wins $2.54 billion in hepatitis C drug trial against Gilead,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co on Thursday was awarded $2.54 billion in royalties by a federal jury in a patent lawsuit against Gilead Sciences Inc over Gilead’s blockbuster hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni. The jury in Delaware reached the verdict following a nearly two-week trial, finding that a patent acquired by Merck in 2014 on hepatitis C treatments was valid. “The jury’s verdict upholds patent protections that are essential to the development of new medical treatments,” Merck said in a statement Thursday. Gilead spokeswoman Michele Rest said the company disagreed with the verdict and would appeal it. She said it did not stop Gilead from continuing to sell its drugs. Merck’s stock rose slightly to $63 in late trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Gilead’s shares fell 2 percent to $74.06 on the Nasdaq. Harvoni and Sovaldi have drawn attention for their breakthrough success in curing hepatitis C in more than 90 percent of patients, and for their high cost. Harvoni’s list price is $1,125 per pill and $94,500 for a 12-week regimen. Foster City, California-based Gilead, one of the world’s largest biotechnology companies, made nearly $20 billion on the two drugs in 2015. The jury’s award was based on a 10 percent royalty rate from the sales of both drugs through August.  The patent upheld by the jury was originally issued to Idenix Pharmaceuticals, a company Merck bought in 2014. Idenix brought the patent lawsuit against Gilead in 2013 in an effort to block the launch of Sovaldi, which was approved by federal regulators in December of that year. Harvoni, which combines Sovaldi’s active ingredient, sofosbuvir, with another drug, was approved in October 2014. Merck, which sells its own hepatitis C drug, Zepatier, previously won a $200 million jury verdict in March in a separate patent infringement case against Gilead over hepatitis C drugs. But in June, a federal judge in San Jose, California overturned the verdict after finding that Merck engaged in a pattern of unethical conduct, including lying under oath. Merck is currently appealing that ruling. ",12152016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-gilead-sciences-merck-co-verdict/merck-wins-2-54-billion-in-hepatitis-c-drug-trial-against-gilead-idUSKBN1442U9

1038,MRK,FDA accepts Merck application for lung cancer combo therapy,"Jan 10 (Reuters) - Merck & Co on Tuesday said the FDA agreed to a speedy review of its application to combine its immunotherapy drug Keytruda with chemotherapy as an initial treatment for advanced lung cancer, potentially giving it a major leg up in the competition for the largest cancer market. Merck said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would decide by May 10 whether to approve the Keytruda combination therapy, sending the drugmaker’s shares more than 3 percent higher. “This comes as an important surprise because if FDA approves the application, Merck would suddenly be catapulted ahead of all other (immunotherapy) competitors who are also pursuing competing combination regimens of their own,” Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note, mentioning Roche, Bristol-Myers Squibb and AstraZeneca. Merck had not previously indicated that it was close to filing for the combination therapy. Industry analysts had been looking for this news toward the end of the year. Keytruda alone is already approved as an initial, or first-line, treatment for advanced lung cancer in patients whose tumors have a high level of PD-L1 expression, the protein that the drug targets to help the immune system fight cancer. This first application for Keytruda in combination with another medicine would include patients with metastatic or advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) regardless of PD-L1 expression level, opening up a much larger market for the medicine. Patients with high PD-L1 expression account for only about a quarter of all lung cancer patients. Evercore ISI estimated the market for first-line lung cancer for all patients could be as high as $14 billion. “While Merck is unlikely to durably penetrate this entire population, especially with multiple competing regimens on the horizon, an approval in May would give them a significant first-mover advantage,” Evercore analyst John Scotti wrote. Keytruda is already also approved to treat advanced melanoma, the deadliest of skin cancers, and head and neck cancers.

1041,MRK,"US STOCKS-Wall Street ends choppy session higher, health lags on Trump comments","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended higher after a choppy day on Wednesday as energy and technology gains countered a drop in healthcare stocks after President-elect Donald Trump said pharmaceutical companies were “getting away with murder” by charging high prices. The Nasdaq ended the day with another record closing high after falling as much as 0.5 percent after Trump’s first formal news conference since the Nov. 8 election. The S&P; 500 healthcare index .SPXHC ended the session down 1 percent after falling as much as 1.9 percent earlier in the day and the Nasdaq biotechnology index .NBI sank 2.96 percent, ending a six-day winning streak for both indexes. “When somebody that high profile says something that negative, people do not want to invest in it. They view the sector as uninvestible, and withdraw their money,” Brad Loncar, manager of the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF (CNCR.O). However, the sector’s pain eased as the session wore on as money managers noted that Trump gave no new specific details on his healthcare proposals, according to Michael Scanlon, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management in Boston.  He cited the beginning of fourth-quarter earnings season on Friday and Trump’s inauguration as President on Jan. 20 as reasons for investor caution. “Portfolio managers have every reason in the world to sit on their hands,” said Scanlon. “You put those two factors together and I don’t think you’re going to see much movement in the market until maybe we get some fireworks on Friday with earnings.”  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI closed up 98.75 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,954.28, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 6.42 points, or 0.28 percent, to 2,275.32 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 11.83 points, or 0.21 percent, to 5,563.65.Eight of the 11 major S&P; sectors ended the day higher. Energy stocks .SPNY, ended 1.2 percent higher as crude oil CLc1 LCOc1 prices rose.  The S&P;’s technology index .SPLRCT ended up 0.7 percent, boosted most by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O).  The biggest drag on the S&P;’s healthcare sector was Bristol-Meyers Squibb’s (BMY.N) with a 5.3 percent decline, after news that Merck & Co. leapfrogged its rivals in the race to combine immunotherapy with other drugs as a treatment for lung cancer. The next-biggest weights on the sector included Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), with a 1.2 percent drop and Abbvie (ABBV.N) with a 3.6 percent decline. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.20-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.22-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P; 500 posted 20 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 99 new highs and 18 new lows. About 7.2 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Wednesday compared with the 6.57 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

1048,MRK,"Bristol-Myers lung cancer delay slams shares, keeps Merck in lead","New YORK (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) shares fell 11 percent on Friday following Thursday’s announcement that it would not seek accelerated approval of its immunotherapy drug combination in first-line lung cancer, further solidifying Merck & Co Inc’s (MRK.N) leading position in the burgeoning immuno-oncolgy field. Lung cancer is by far the biggest oncology market and a handful of companies have been battling to become dominant in initial, or first-line, treatment, and to provide much-needed combination therapies. Merck shares rose 3.6 percent to $62.53, while Bristol fell to $49.23. Bristol-Myers earlier this month suggested it would seek a path to swift approval of an Opdivo/Yervoy combination in first-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) only to reverse course after reviewing available data. The company did not say whether the data was disappointing or merely insufficient to seek accelerated approval. Cowen and Co analyst Steve Scala downgraded his rating on Bristol shares to “market perform” from “outperform” and lowered his price target on the stock to $65 from $85. The quickly changing lung cancer market dynamics could hurt Bristol’s earnings per share, Scala said. The news followed Merck’s surprise announcement last week that it had filed for a speedy U.S. approval of its Opdivo rival, Keytruda, in combination with chemotherapy in first-line lung cancer, and had received a May 10 regulatory decision date. The Opdivo/Yervoy news “certainly kills any potential for commercial sales in front-line lung cancer for 2017” and could leave Bristol-Myers as the third or fourth entry instead of being first or a close second, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said. But it is by no means a death knell for Opdivo or the combination if the data is ultimately positive. “This is lung cancer,” Divan said. “If the combo ends up showing clearly superior efficacy in terms of overall survival, then doctors will switch to that.” Opdivo is approved for lung cancer in previously treated patients, as well as advanced melanoma, kidney and head and neck cancers and Hodgkin lymphoma. Suntrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris lowered his estimates for Opdivo sales in 2021 to $8.5 billion from $9.7 billion. Merck will not only likely be first with a first-line lung combination, but said it will be less expensive due to the lower cost of chemotherapy versus rivals’ pairings of newer immuno-oncology drugs. Bristol, which was first to market with potentially game-changing drugs that spur the immune system to fight cancer, was long perceived as the industry leader in immuno-oncology, with Merck hot on its heels and AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) and Roche Holding AG (ROG.S) playing catch-up. That changed in August, when Bristol’s Opdivo failed as a monotherapy against first-line lung cancer, where Merck’s Keytruda succeeded, resetting the immuno-oncology pecking order.  Some analysts said the latest Opdivo setback was good news for AstraZeneca and Roche, allowing them to close the gap on Bristol-Myers. However, Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson noted that Astra’s combination includes a CTLA4 drug similar to Bristol’s Yervoy. “This could have negative implications for AstraZeneca, who similarly has CTLA4 combination at the heart of its IO platform,” he wrote.

In his speech, Trump said U.S. policy will be to buy American and hire American, reiterating what he had said many times during this campaign for the White House. Some investors said the comments reinforced concerns about potential protectionist trade policies. Indexes pared gains during his speech and ended off the highest levels of the day. The rally in stocks since the Nov. 8 election had stalled in recent weeks as investors awaited clarity on his plans to boost the economy. “If you want to take the inaugural speech as a signal of anything, it’s that trade remains at the top of the agenda and he’s going to do something about it quickly,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts. Still, the S&P; 500’s 6.2-percent gain since the election is one of the best performances for the American stock market for any presidential transition period of the modern era. Former President Barack Obama’s transition period, which came amid the throes of the 2008 financial crisis, overlapped a 15.5 percent fall for the S&P; 500 from his election to the day of his 2009 inauguration. Yet he presided over the second-best run for the stock market under any president since Republican Dwight Eisenhower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 94.85 points, or 0.48 percent, to 19,827.25, the S&P; 500 gained 7.62 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,271.31 and the Nasdaq Composite added 15.25 points, or 0.28 percent, to 5,555.33. The Dow snapped a five-session losing streak, but all three major indexes ended with losses for the week. The S&P; 500 has fallen by a median 2.7 percent in the month after each new president has taken the keys to the White House since Herbert Hoover in January 1929, according to a Reuters analysis. Among the day’s gainers, Merck rose 3.6 percent to $62.53 after Bristol-Myers said it would not seek accelerated U.S. approval for a combination of its two immunotherapy drugs as an initial treatment for lung cancer, giving Merck an advantage in the lucrative market. Bristol-Myers’ stock fell 11.3 percent. About 6.6 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, higher than the 6.1 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.76-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.58-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P; 500 posted 19 new 52-week highs and seven new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 85 new highs and 33 new lows.

1054,MRK,Merck reveals seven years of its U.S. drug price increase history,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co (MRK.N) on Friday posted seven years of information showing a high single-digit percentage annual average price hike across its portfolio of medicines in a move that provides new details on its pricing practices for the U.S. market. Politicians, health insurers and most recently President Donald Trump have criticized drug companies over high U.S. prices for prescription drugs and repeated price hikes. Trump said pharmaceutical companies have been “getting away with murder.” Other pharmaceutical companies have also signaled intentions to address rising criticism over prescription drug cost.  In every year after 2010, Merck said its average list price hikes over its entire drug portfolio was more than 9 percent, peaking at 10.5 percent in 2014. The averages are near the 10 percent level that some pharmaceutical executives and lawmakers have targeted recently.  See graphic tmsnrt.rs/2katwVw The pricing information, which can be found on Merck’s website, provides data from 2010 through 2016 on average annual increases to list price, as well as net price after discounts and rebates to payers, including pharmaceutical benefit managers and insurers. It also lists the average discount for each year. Merck’s most important new revenue growth driver, the cancer drug Keytruda, lists for about $150,000 per year of treatment. The class of medicines that are transforming cancer treatment by helping the immune system to attack tumors command high prices but so far help only about 20 percent of patients who receive them. Merck’s chart shows that its annual net price increases ranged from a low of 3.4 percent in 2010 to a high of 6.2 percent in 2012. In 2013, 2015 and 2016, they were 5.5 percent. The average discount from list price climbed from 27.3 percent in 2010 to 40.9 percent in 2016, Merck said. Payers have been demanding increasing discounts and rebates in exchange for covering a drugmakers’ medicines. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) on Tuesday said it was planning to release a “pharmaceutical transparency report” with new disclosures on U.S. pricing, research and development expenses, and programs to supply medicines to those who cannot afford them. Earlier this month, AbbVie (ABBV.N) became the third major drugmaker to pledge to keep U.S. price increases under 10 percent in 2017.

1056,MRK,Roche cancer drug taking bite out of Bristol's Opdivo,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Roche’s cancer drug Tecentriq hit the market months behind immuno-oncology (I/O) medicines from Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co but the Swiss drugmaker’s treatment is making up lost ground. On Thursday, Bristol-Myers managers said Tecentriq is grabbing market share from its I/O drug Opdivo for second-line non-small-cell lung cancer, one factor that forced them to cut their 2017 earnings forecast. “Most of our erosion in second line has been attributable to” Tecentriq, Murdo Gordon, Bristol-Myers’s chief commercial officer, told analysts. “We gave up about 10 points of market share.” Merck’s Keytruda drug is also taking patients away from Opdivo, Bristol-Myers said.  The U.S.-based company’s muted Opdivo outlook underscores why analysts predict Roche, when it announces full-year 2016 results on Feb. 1, will confirm Tecentriq sales have accelerated, particularly since its initial approval for bladder cancer in May was expanded in October to cover lung cancer. “Tecentriq continues to show strong launch trends in the fourth quarter 2016,” wrote Jeffrey Holford, a Jefferies analyst. “We have been surprised on the upside by its launch.”  Life sciences consultancy IMS estimates Tecentriq’s May-September sales for bladder cancer hit nearly $70 million, but that does not include lung cancer figures, the biggest cancer market.  Roche declined to provide sales numbers, saying only “we can confirm that we have seen a good launch of Tecentriq”.  Tecentriq, Opdivo and Keytruda work by helping the immune system recognize tumors that cloak themselves against detection. Roche and Bristol-Myers drugs are approved for use after other lung cancer treatments fail, while Keytruda has the FDA’s blessing as an initial treatment and is now seeking the go-ahead for combination therapy with chemotherapy, which Merck contends puts it in the pole position in the I/O race.

There were 270 shareholder lawsuits in 2016 accusing companies of making false or misleading statements or concealing bad news about their businesses or mergers, a study released on Tuesday by Cornerstone Research and Stanford Law School shows. The number rose from 188 in 2015, and was the highest since the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, designed to curb frivolous lawsuits, took effect in 1995. A separate study last week from NERA Economic Consulting also noted a two-decade high. Cornerstone attributed much of the increase to a surge in federal lawsuits challenging mergers, to 80 from 17. That trend could prove sustainable. It followed a series of Delaware state court decisions culminating in Chancellor Andre Bouchard’s January 2016 rejection of a settlement arising from Zillow Group Inc’s purchase of online real estate rival Trulia Inc. Chancery Court judges decided to no longer reflexively approve “disclosure-only” settlements requiring companies merely to reveal more, often immaterial details about their mergers. Lawyers are not entitled to six- or seven-figure paydays for winning that, the judges said. Roughly half of the Fortune 500 companies are incorporated in Delaware, long seen as having laws favorable to business. Cornerstone said the number of traditional securities class actions, often following revelations of weak financial results or regulatory probes, rose to 189 last year from 170 in 2015. It said the “maximum dollar loss,” or largest sums that shareholders might claim in damages, rose to $823 billion from $371 billion, and topped even the $816 billion level from 2008. Eighty of the 270 lawsuits targeted biotechnology, healthcare and pharmaceutical companies. Thirty-four targeted financial companies. NERA, meanwhile, said settlements also increased, to 113 last year from 109 in 2015. It said the average settlement was $72 million, topped by HSBC Holdings Plc’s $1.575 billion accord over lending practices at Household International Inc, a consumer finance company it bought, and Merck & Co’s $1.06 billion accord over its marketing of the painkiller Vioxx.

1061,MRK,Merck 2017 forecast reassuring; full-speed ahead with Keytruda,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N), faced with patent expirations and increasing development costs for its high-profile Keytruda cancer immunotherapy, reassured investors on Thursday with a 2017 profit forecast roughly in line with Wall Street expectations. Shares of Merck were up nearly 3 percent at $63.90 after the U.S. drugmaker also reported fourth-quarter earnings that matched analysts’ expectations. Despite acknowledging a need to hold down costs, Merck said it was charging ahead with Keytruda development, with about 430 studies ongoing in a wide variety of cancers and combinations with other therapies. Merck forecast 2017 earnings of $3.72 to $3.87 per share, excluding special items. Analysts on average were expecting $3.85 per share. The company gave a revenue outlook of $38.6 billion to $40.1 billion, compared with analysts’ expectations of $40.04 billion. “We are actually implying EPS growth despite the headwinds of loss of exclusivity and (foreign exchange) and the other challenges that we face,” Chief Executive Officer Ken Frazier told analysts on a conference call. Merck expects unfavorable foreign exchange rates to sap 2 percent from 2017 global sales. Frazier said Merck was in the market for deals to augment its early to mid-stage drug development pipeline if the price is right. Such moves are not contingent on tax reform or changes to U.S. healthcare laws being discussed by President Trump and Congress, he added.   In 2017, Merck will face generic competition for cholesterol drugs Zetia and Vytorin, antibiotic Cubicin and its Nasonex nasal spray in the United States and for Remicade, its big-selling arthritis drug, in Europe. But the U.S. drugmaker is confident it can solidify its leading position for Keytruda in lung cancer, by far the largest oncology market, and that it has the potential to become a foundational therapy in other cancers as well. Last summer Merck leapfrogged Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) as the perceived leader in the market for potentially game-changing drugs that spur the immune system to fight cancer, when Keytruda extended survival among previously untreated lung cancer patients. Bristol’s rival drug, Opdivo, failed to do so. Keytruda is now approved as a first-option treatment for non-small cell lung cancer patients whose tumor cells display a high level of the PD-L1 protein the drug targets, as well as for patients whose cancer has progressed after other treatments. Merck said there has been a significant acceleration of PD-L1 testing, a clear indication of heightened interest in use of Keytruda in first-line lung cancer. In May, Merck may also get U.S. approval for Keytruda with chemotherapy in first-line lung cancer, opening it up to many more potential patients. Edward Jones healthcare analyst Ashtyn Evans forecast annual Keytruda sales would reach $7 billion by 2020. She said there was relief that Merck’s 2017 forecast was not lower “because they really need to put a significant amount of investment behind Keytruda.”   Fourth-quarter Keytruda sales more than doubled from a year earlier to $483 million, with 40 percent coming from melanoma, its initial approval, and 30 percent from lung cancer.

1069,MRK,Merck stopping late stage study as another Alzheimer's drug fails,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc said on Tuesday it will halt a late-stage trial of an Alzheimer’s drug after it was determined that it had no chance of working, marking the latest in a long line of crushing disappointments in efforts to find an effective treatment for the mind-wasting disease.  The company was testing its drug, verubecestat, in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease. But an independent data monitoring committee determined that there was “virtually no chance of finding a positive clinical effect” and recommended the trial be stopped for futility. The news sent Merck shares down nearly 2 percent in after hours trading. Verubecestat belongs to a class of experimental Alzheimer’s drugs called BACE1 inhibitors that target an enzyme involved in the formation of the toxic amyloid protein that turns into plaques in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients. Several companies are pinning hopes on Alzheimer’s treatments using the BASE inhibitor mechanism, including Eli Lilly and Co, Biogen and Novartis in collaboration with Amgen Inc. Lilly previously endured multiple failures with its solanezumab, which also targets beta amyloid, but in a different way. In the most recent setback, Lilly said that drug failed to slow declines in mental capacity of patients with even mild symptoms. Researchers are increasingly focusing on attacking the disease earlier as it appears likely that once symptoms have taken hold current approaches fail to work. Merck said another study of its drug in patients with prodromal, or very early, Alzheimer’s disease would continue with results expected by February 2019. Patients with prodromal Alzheimer’s disease have objective memory problems but relatively normal functioning in activities of daily living. Blinded clinical trials use independent monitors to watch for any unexpected safety problems that may crop up. They can also recommend stopping a study early if it becomes clear that a drug is going to fail or if the data looks so compelling that it believes the treatment should be offered to those getting a placebo or other standard treatments.

1075,MRK,Merck drug prevents serious infection after marrow transplant: study,"(Reuters) - An experimental Merck & Co drug succeeded in preventing clinically serious cytomegalovirus (CMV) following bone marrow transplant and was associated with a lower death rate compared with placebo in a late state study, the company said. Merck said it will apply for U.S. and European approval of the antiviral drug letermovir this year. It has been granted orphan status, which comes with several extra years of marketing exclusivity if approved. Analysts on average are forecasting annual sales exceeding $200 million by 2022, according to Thomson Reuters data. CMV, a common virus, is a serious complication associated with bone marrow transplants used to treat acute leukemias and other cancers and diseases of the bone marrow. In the study of 495 patients aged 18 and older who underwent bone marrow transplants, 37.5 percent who received either oral or intravenous letermovir developed clinically significant CMV infections by 24 weeks after the procedure. That compared with 60.6 percent of those who received a placebo, a statistically significant difference. Letermovir was also associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality through week 24, with a death rate of just under 10 percent versus 16 percent in the placebo group, researchers reported. “To me this is huge,” Dr. Francisco Marty, the study’s lead investigator from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said in a telephone interview on Thursday.  The trial shows that a primary prophylaxis strategy works “with a drug that has a side effect profile better than anything we’ve had before and that may confer a survival advantage,” said Marty, who will present the data at a medical meeting in Orlando on Sunday. Data on how patients fared 48 weeks after transplant will  be presented at a later date, Marty said.         While there are treatments against CMV once it occurs, prior attempts to find a safe drug that could prevent serious infection after marrow transplants have failed, most recently Chimerix’s brincidofovir due to toxicity issues. “This has been a quest for almost 30 years and we finally cracked the nut,” Marty said. “Finally we have something that works very nicely and we had lower mortality.” Adverse side effects more common with letermovir than  placebo included vomiting, cough and peripheral edema, researchers reported. The Merck drug did not adversely impact blood count or cause kidney damage seen with other drugs, Marty said. He added that he would like to see Merck test the once-daily medicine in younger patients and possibly with other organ transplants.

Keytruda is already approved as a cost-effective treatment in melanoma and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence also on Dec. 2 approved its use in the treatment of lung cancer patients who had started on chemotherapy, after Merck & Co cut the price further for the NHS. But trial data so far on the survival benefit of Keytruda as an initial lung cancer treatment has not been reliable enough,   according to NICE’s draft guidance, which will be subject to public consultation until 21 March. “The exact size of the overall survival gain for Keytruda compared to the current standard of care was uncertain because of the immaturity of the data,” a NICE spokeswoman said. Keytruda has proved effective in fighting non-small cell lung cancer in patients with high levels of a protein called PD-L1, which makes them more receptive to immunotherapy.

1086,MRK,U.S. appeals court revives Fosamax warning claims against Merck,"(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Wednesday revived hundreds of claims by plaintiffs who accused Merck & Co of failing to adequately warn about the risks of thigh bone fractures associated with its osteoporosis drug Fosamax. The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia said the plaintiffs may proceed to trial and a lower court judge erred in finding their state law claims pre-empted by federal law, based on actions of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Circuit Judge Julio Fuentes said the plaintiffs produced sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that the FDA would have approved “a properly worded warning about the risk of thigh fractures - or at the very least, to conclude that the odds of FDA rejection were less than highly probable.” Merck and its law firm did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to a similar request. The decision overturned a March 2014 ruling by U.S. District Judge Joel Pisano, who has since retired from the bench. Pisano had ruled that all claims by plaintiffs who were injured prior to Sept. 14, 2010, were pre-empted, leaving only about 20 active cases. Fosamax has been prescribed to treat or prevent bone loss in post-menopausal women since 1995. Merck’s sales of the drug totaled $3.05 billion in 2007, the last year before the Kenilworth, New Jersey-based company lost patent exclusivity. Fosamax is now available as a generic. The plaintiffs claimed to suffer thigh fractures stemming from long-term use of Fosamax and said Merck knew about the risk for more than a decade before adding a warning label.

1087,MRK,Merck must face renewed Fosamax warning claims: U.S. appeals court,"(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Wednesday revived claims by several hundred plaintiffs who accused Merck & Co of failing to adequately warn about the risks of thigh bone fractures associated with its osteoporosis drug Fosamax. In a 3-0 decision, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia said the plaintiffs may proceed to trial on their failure-to-warn claims, and a lower court judge erred in finding the claims pre-empted by federal law. Merck said it is reviewing its options, and that a judge, not a jury, should decide the pre-emption question. It also said it remains “confident” in Fosamax’s safety and effectiveness. David Frederick, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Fosamax, whose chemical name is alendronate sodium, has been prescribed to treat or prevent bone loss in post-menopausal women since 1995. But the plaintiffs claimed to suffer atypical femur fractures from long-term use, and said Merck knew about the risk for more than a decade before adding it to the Fosamax warning label in January 2011. The Kenilworth, New Jersey-based company changed the label four months after an outside task force hired by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration published a report associating Fosamax with the fractures. In March 2014, U.S. District Judge Joel Pisano in Trenton, New Jersey, dismissed all claims by plaintiffs injured before Sept. 14, 2010, the date of the task force report, leaving only about 20 active cases. The judge, who retired from the bench in 2015, cited a 2009 U.S. Supreme Court decision that state law-based failure-to-warn claims were pre-empted when there was “clear evidence” that the FDA would not have approved a warning that plaintiffs requested. Writing for the appeals court, however, Circuit Judge Julio Fuentes found enough evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that the FDA would have approved “a properly-worded warning” about Fosamax, “or at the very least, to conclude that the odds of FDA rejection were less than highly probable.” Fuentes said a jury could also find that some doctors would not have prescribed Fosamax had Merck discussed the risk of fractures on a warning label.  Merck’s annual sales of Fosamax regularly topped $3 billion before the company lost patent exclusivity in 2008. Fosamax is now available as a generic. Sales of Fosamax totaled $284 million last year, down from $3.05 billion in 2007. In afternoon trading, Merck shares were down 0.8 percent at $63.43.

1111,MRK,"Fitch: Fresenius Deals Offer Growth, Diversification; No Rating Impact","(The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, April 26 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings says transactions by German healthcare group Fresenius SE & Co KGaA (FSE; BBB-/Stable) - including Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA (FMC; together, Fresenius) - that enable its diversification into US generics through Akorn and biosimilars through Merck, will enhance its business risk profile. The group is well anchored in investment-grade territory, although the transactions will exhaust any financial headroom and flexibility at the current rating. We expect Akorn's enterprise value of EUR4.5 billion (around 12.5x forward-looking EBITDA) to be fully debt funded upon completion by 2018 and the upfront payment of EUR170 million plus subsequent milestone payments to Merck to be paid out of Fresenius' available liquidity, with payments starting in 2017. The transactions will use up headroom available under the current rating, as Fitch estimates consolidated funds from operations (FFO) adjusted net leverage upon completion to peak at 4.4x in 2018, within its negative rating sensitivity of 4.5x. Steady deleveraging will follow thereafter and this should then improve financial headroom for the rating. The 'BBB-' rating also remains supported by adequate financial flexibility, with consolidated FFO fixed-charge cover comfortably above 3.0x over the rating horizon, assuming a debt capital market refinancing of the acquisitions. The transactions - following on from the recent Quironsalud purchase - will widen the divergence of financial risk profiles between holding company FSE and FMC as FFO adjusted net leverage at FSE (including attributable dividends received from FMC) will peak above 5.0x. We consider this incompatible with the current rating if viewed on a de-consolidated basis due to the lack of debt cross-guarantees between FSE and FMC, and if sustained for longer than 18-24 months. Nonetheless, we assume steady and gradual deleveraging after closing, in line with previous transactions by Fresenius such as Rhoen Kliniken in 2014 and APP in 2008. This view is supported by Akorn's satisfactory profitability and cash generation, coupled with strong synergy potential, achievable in a comparatively short time, and limited execution risk. The 'BBB-' rating of the senior unsecured debt issued by FSE assumes that the acquisitions will be refinanced by debt instruments ranking pari passu with existing unsecured issues, decreasing structural subordination in the group's funding structure. In any case, deconsolidated secured net debt/EBITDA at FSE remains below 2.5x, and so does not require a differentiation of the instrument rating from the Issuer Default Rating under Fitch's methodology. We consider both deals to enhance the business risk profile of Fresenius Kabi, which will become larger and more diversified in the US through the addition of Akorn's strong position in injectables and liquid/sterile generics. This will complement Fresenius Kabi's business and add direct sales channels to retail pharmacies and physicians in addition to hospitals and clinics in the US.  We therefore view the acquisition as in line with industry trends, with generic producers bulking up and deepening their product portfolio to gain scale and bargaining power against highly consolidated healthcare payers. The transactions also help diversify the group's revenue stream away from its more mature but still growing dialysis business (52% of group sales by 2019 compared with 57% in 2011). The move into biosimilars, probably strategically less obvious for Fresenius Kabi, can be viewed with a similar logic. We believe it will present Fresenius with a credible long-term strategic option to position Fresenius Kabi in this emerging growth segment. Biosimilars offer significant growth potential as an increasing number of reference biologics come off patent in the near term. However, the market is inherently riskier than small-molecule generics, due to higher development costs, including an often lengthy approval pathway, coupled with complexities around manufacturing and marketing this category of drugs. In addition, there is significant competition building up from larger and established companies, particularly in oncology and autoimmune diseases, targeted by Fresenius Kabi/Merck. We therefore view the strategy of entering the market with contractually agreed access to manufacturing and development expertise with an established pharma company, and in a capital-preserving manner, linking payments to commercial success of these treatments, as a sensible approach.

1113,MRK,Merck eyes key cancer drug growth as others lose patent protection,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc on Tuesday reported better-than-expected profit in the first quarter as surprisingly strong demand for animal health products, vaccines and its hepatitis C treatment offset nearly $700 million in lower sales from drugs that lost patent protection. The U.S. drugmaker said its fast-growing immuno-oncology drug Keytruda is gaining market share and sees future sales opportunities across multiple types of cancer, despite first quarter sales of $584 million falling just shy of analysts’ estimates. The company said Keytruda has become “the most prescribed” product for previously untreated, or first-line, lung cancer and it is looking to expand its use in second-line lung therapy. Merck is awaiting a potential U.S. approval next week for Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy. “The approval could meaningfully boost sales of Keytruda given the size of the lung cancer market,” said Edward Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans of by far the largest oncology market. Research chief Roger Perlmutter called the combination “a major opportunity to establish Keytruda further as a real preferred treatment therapy.” Keytruda use is also growing in head and neck cancers, with 15 percent of U.S. sales for that indication now compared with 40 percent from lung. Merck slightly raised its 2017 adjusted earnings forecast to a range of $3.76 to $3.88 per share from its prior view $3.72 to $3.87, due to a favorable foreign exchange environment. It now expects full-year revenue of $39.1 billion to $40.3 billion, up from $38.6 billion-$40.1 billion. Total revenue rose 1.3 percent to $9.43 billion in the quarter, beating analysts’ average estimate of $9.25 billion, despite the loss of U.S. patent exclusivity on cholesterol drug Zetia, antibiotic Cubicin, Nasonex nasal spray, and new competition for rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade in Europe. Merck’s blockbuster cholesterol drug Vytorin will also face competition from cheap generic rivals going forward. “In addition to Keytruda, we’ve got multiple other launches that are showing good growth and we’ve got a strong portfolio of vaccines” to help offset loss of exclusivities, said Adam Schechter, Merck’s head of global human health. Merck’s hepatitis C treatment Zepatier had sales of $378 million, topping analysts’ estimates of $269 million, while sales of $532 million for Gardasil vaccine against human papillomavirus also sailed past Wall Street forecasts. Animal health sales grew 13 percent to $939 million. The company cautioned that animal health growth would be “more measured in subsequent quarters.” Excluding items, Merck earned 88 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by 5 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

1118,MRK,AstraZeneca immunotherapy wins first approval in bladder cancer,"(Reuters) - U.S. regulators have approved AstraZeneca’s key immunotherapy drug durvalumab as a treatment for bladder cancer, marking the first commercial green light for a product the company hopes will go on to sell billions of dollars. The approval, while expected, marks a milestone for the British company, which expects new cancer drugs to help revive its fortunes following patent losses on older blockbuster products like cholesterol pill Crestor and Nexium for heartburn. Bladder cancer itself is a relatively small initial market, where AstraZeneca is lagging behind rivals Bristol-Myers Squibb and Roche whose immunotherapies are already approved for the condition. Durvalumab’s big commercial opportunity lies in previously untreated lung cancer, where key clinical trial results, including with combination therapy, are due in June or July. Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez sees durvalumab capturing a modest 10 percent of the estimated $2.3 billion global bladder cancer market, while AstraZeneca in 2014 put the drug’s peak sales in all cancers at $6.5 billion, including combination use. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said late on Monday it granted accelerated approval to AstraZeneca’s drug to treat advanced bladder cancer in patients whose disease had progressed despite chemotherapy. The drug, which will have the brand name Imfinzi, works by helping the body’s immune cells kill cancer, offering an alternative to toxic chemotherapy. While not without side effects, such immuno-oncology treatment has the potential of longer-lasting efficacy, although it comes at a high price. AstraZeneca said the average wholesale acquisition cost of durvalumab would be around $15,000 a month. “This first approval for Imfinzi is an important milestone in our return to growth,” said AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot. The drug belongs to a new class of medicines called PD-L1 inhibitors that block a mechanism tumors use to evade detection from the immune system. It was approved by the FDA for use in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, by far the most common form of bladder cancer, regardless of their status for the amount of PD-L1 protein on their cancer cells. Durvalumab won accelerated approval, which enables the use of therapies for serious conditions to fill an unmet medical need based on data the FDA believes is likely to predict a clinical benefit. AstraZeneca is required to conduct trials to confirm actual benefit to patients.  The FDA also approved a complementary diagnostic from Roche that can be used with the drug to assess PD-L1 levels. Studies have shown patients with high PD-L1 are more likely to do well on durvalumab, although such a test is not required for its use. Durvalumab is being tested on its own and also in combination with another immune system-boosting therapy called tremelimumab in various cancers. The medicine is the latest immunotherapy to be approved by the FDA, after nods for treatments developed against various cancers by Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck & Co, Roche, and a collaboration between Germany’s Merck KGaA and Pfizer. AstraZeneca shares were up 0.3 percent in early London trading on Tuesday.

1121,MRK,UPDATE 2-U.S. FDA approves Merck immunotherapy/chemo combo for lung cancer,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co (MRK.N) said on Wednesday U.S. health regulators  approved its Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated advanced lung cancer, solidifying the drugmaker’s lead position in the field of medicines that help the immune system fight cancer. Lung cancer is by far the largest oncology market and the approval significantly expands the number of patients available for Keytruda therapy. Merck shares were up 3.2 percent at $65.99 in extended trading. “This is the key game changer for Keytruda,” said Leerink Partners analyst Seamus Fernandez, adding that he expects physician acceptance to be “pretty robust.” The accelerated approval was based on data from a study of 123 previously untreated patients with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). “It was a small trial but the results were really quite striking,” said Roy Baynes, head of global clinical development for Merck Research Labs. The Food and Drug Administration approved Keytruda in combination with Eli Lilly’s (LLY.N) Alimta, the chemotherapy drug used in the study that led to the agency’s decision. Merck may be asked to conduct another trial to confirm the clinical benefit of the combination. Keytruda alone was already approved as an initial, or first-line, therapy for advanced NSCLC in patients whose cancer cells have a high level of the PD-L1 protein the drug targets. The combination allows for treatment regardless of level of PD-L1. Merck scored a coup last year, when Keytruda extended patient survival in a first-line lung cancer trial, supplanting Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) as the perceived leader in the field. Bristol’s rival drug Opdivo surprisingly failed to show a survival benefit compared with chemotherapy in a similar study. Both drugs and one from Roche (ROG.S) were already approved for lung cancer once a prior treatment fails or stops working. The medicines belong to a new class of cancer drugs, called PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors, that block a mechanism tumors use to evade detection by the immune system. There are now five approved for a variety of cancers, but all companies involved are aiming for a slice of the lung cancer market. Bristol-Myers is testing Opdivo with its other immunotherapy, Yervoy, as a first-line NSCLC treatment, but did not seek accelerated approval. AstraZeneca (AZN.L) is also testing an all immuno-oncology combination with highly anticipated data expected mid-year. The original Keytruda first-line approval allowed for treatment of about 30 percent of NSCLC cases. The combination could be used on all patients with non-squamous NSCLC, which accounts for about 75 percent of lung cancer cases.

1127,MRK,"Merck, Upsher-Smith to pay $60 million in 'pay-for-delay' drug case","(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc and Upsher-Smith Laboratories Inc have agreed to pay $60.2 million to resolve a lawsuit that said they  entered into a deal to unlawfully delay the availability of generic versions of potassium supplement K-Dur. The settlement, disclosed in papers filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey on Monday, came in a class action filed in 2001 arising out of a settlement in patent litigation between Upsher-Smith and Schering-Plough Corp, now owned by Merck. That patent deal, plaintiffs in the antitrust class action said, was an example of a “pay-for-delay” settlement, in which brand-name drug makers pay generic companies to keep their products off the market for a longer period. Both companies continued to deny wrongdoing as part of the settlement, according to court papers. The settlement is subject to court approval. Neither Merck nor Upsher-Smith immediately responded to requests for comment on Tuesday. The lawsuit stemmed from a settlement between the companies in 1998 that resolved patent litigation in which Schering-Plough sought to block Upsher-Smith from marketing a planned generic version of K-Dur until a patent expired in 2006. Under that settlement, Upsher-Smith agreed not to market a generic version before 2001, at which point Schering would grant it a license, and Schering agreed to pay Upsher-Smith at least $60 million, according to court papers. The class action lawsuit, by direct purchasers of K-Dur including drug wholesalers and hospitals, said the companies violated antitrust laws through the unlawful delay of generic K-Dur.

1129,MRK,Merck says test shows Keytruda improves survival for bladder cancer patients,"(Reuters) - Pivotal trial results for Merck & Co Inc’s immunotherapy drug Keytruda show that it lengthened survival by three months, or nearly 40 percent, for patients with advanced bladder cancer who had stopped responding to chemotherapy. The data, to be presented next month at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, follow last week’s announcement that rival drug Tecentriq, from Roche Holding AG, did not improve survival when used as a second-line treatment for bladder cancer in a trial. The Merck drug is awaiting U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, but Tecentriq was approved by the agency last year, contingent on verification of its clinical benefit. Roche, in an emailed statement, said it plans to discuss the data with health authorities but did not disclose the timing for the discussions. According to the FDA approval letter, the company  has until December to submit the full trial data to the agency. Merck filed in February for FDA approval of Keytruda for both initial and secondary treatment of advanced urothelial cancer, the most common type of bladder cancer. Keytruda is already approved for treating melanoma, lung cancer, head and neck cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma. Merck announced in October that the second-line bladder cancer study met its main goal and was stopped early. The company is currently enrolling patients in a phase three trial of Keytruda, combined with chemotherapy, as an initial treatment for bladder cancer. In addition to Tecentriq’s approval for bladder cancer patients whose disease has stopped responding to chemotherapy, the FDA last month approved the Roche drug as an initial treatment for people with a specific type of advanced bladder cancer and in people whose cancer progressed despite at least one prior platinum-containing chemotherapy.  The agency has also granted contingent approval to AstraZeneca Plc’s Imfinzi, Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo and Bavencio, developed by Pfizer Inc and Merck KGaA, as second-line bladder cancer treatments. All five drugs are part of a new class of treatments designed to unleash the body’s immune system to fight cancer by interfering with proteins known as PD-1 or PD-L1 that help malignant cells evade immune attack. Merck said data from an open-label Phase 3 trial of 542 advanced bladder cancer patients showed median survival of 10.3 months for Keytruda patients and 7.4 months for patients given second-line chemotherapy. The study’s median follow-up was 18.5 months. After 18 months, 36 percent of Keytruda patients were alive, compared with 20.5 percent of chemotherapy patients, according to research published by ASCO. The study did not detect a difference in the length of time patients lived without their disease getting worse. Severe side effects were reported in 16.5 percent of the Keytruda patients, compared with nearly half of the chemotherapy group.

1130,MRK,UPDATE 1-Merck says test shows Keytruda improves survival for bladder cancer patients,"(Reuters) - Pivotal trial results for Merck & Co Inc’s immunotherapy drug Keytruda show that it lengthened survival by three months, or nearly 40 percent, for patients with advanced bladder cancer who had stopped responding to chemotherapy. The data, to be presented next month at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, follow last week’s announcement that rival drug Tecentriq, from Roche Holding AG, did not improve survival when used as a second-line treatment for bladder cancer in a trial. The Merck drug is awaiting U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, but Tecentriq was approved by the agency last year, contingent on verification of its clinical benefit. Roche, in an emailed statement, said it plans to discuss the data with health authorities but did not disclose the timing for the discussions. According to the FDA approval letter, the company  has until December to submit the full trial data to the agency. Merck filed in February for FDA approval of Keytruda for both initial and secondary treatment of advanced urothelial cancer, the most common type of bladder cancer. Keytruda is already approved for treating melanoma, lung cancer, head and neck cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma. Merck announced in October that the second-line bladder cancer study met its main goal and was stopped early. The company is currently enrolling patients in a phase three trial of Keytruda, combined with chemotherapy, as an initial treatment for bladder cancer.

1131,MRK,"Merck, Incyte immunotherapy combination effective in lung cancer study","(Reuters) - A combination of the Merck & Co immunotherapy Keytruda and a different type of drug that also helps the immune system fight cancer from Incyte Corp led to a high rate of durable responses in a small, ongoing study of patients with advanced lung cancer, according to data released on Wednesday. Incyte shares rose more than 6 percent to $128 in post-market trading, after the data became public. Fourteen of 40, or 35 percent, of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who received Keytruda and Incyte’s epacadostat experienced tumor shrinkage of at least 30 percent. That is nearly double the overall response rate of about 18-20 percent seen with Keytruda alone in other studies. BMO Capital Markets analyst Ian Somaiya, in a research note prior to release of the data, said a response rate of about 24-29 percent with a good safety profile would be viewed favorably. Patients in the trial had received prior treatments, such as chemotherapy. Twelve of the 14 patients who saw significant tumor shrinkage continued to respond to the therapy, with the longest so far at more than 500 days, indicating potential for long-lasting responses. Epacadostat belongs to a new class of experimental drugs called IDO1 inhibitors which block an enzyme that protects tumors from the immune system. Keytruda is one of five approved drugs known as PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors that block a different mechanism tumors use to evade detection. The companies believe the two can work together without the added toxicity observed with other combinations because PD-1 drugs are systemic, while IDO1 works specifically at the tumor site. Three percent of patients discontinued treatment due to side effects, such as elevated liver enzymes, with one patient dropping out with brain swelling. The data was included in a brief summary of the study that will be presented and likely updated next month at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago. There will also be data on the combination in bladder, kidney and head and neck cancers in addition to NSCLC. The companies are planning much larger Phase 3 studies in all of those cancers. “We have an ambitious program and we believe (IDO1 inhibition) can be a very important piece for the next few years in improving immunotherapy for cancer patients,” Incyte Chief Executive Herve Hoppenot said.

The settlement, disclosed in papers filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey on Monday, came in a class action filed in 2001 arising out of a settlement in patent litigation between Upsher-Smith and Schering-Plough Corp, now owned by Merck. That patent deal, plaintiffs in the antitrust class action said, was an example of a “pay-for-delay” settlement, in which brand-name drug makers pay generic companies to keep their products off the market for a longer period. Both companies continued to deny wrongdoing as part of the settlement, according to court papers. The settlement is subject to court approval. Neither Merck nor Upsher-Smith immediately responded to requests for comment on Tuesday. The lawsuit stemmed from a settlement between the companies in 1998 that resolved patent litigation in which Schering-Plough sought to block Upsher-Smith from marketing a planned generic version of K-Dur until a patent expired in 2006. Under that settlement, Upsher-Smith agreed not to market a generic version before 2001, at which point Schering would grant it a license, and Schering agreed to pay Upsher-Smith at least $60 million, according to court papers. The class action lawsuit, by direct purchasers of K-Dur including drug wholesalers and hospitals, said the companies violated antitrust laws through the unlawful delay of generic K-Dur. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission had also sued Schering-Plough in 2011 over payments to rivals to delay generic versions of K-Dur. The FTC ultimately lost that case.

1142,MRK,"FDA clears Merck's Keytruda based on cancer genetics, not location","(Reuters) - Merck & Co’s immunotherapy Keytruda on Tuesday became the first cancer drug ever approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration based on a patients’ specific genetic traits, regardless of where in the body the disease originated. The approval marks a major step in so-called precision medicine, where genetic biomarkers may determine the course of therapy rather than the type of cancer. The hope is that advanced genetic information will one day be able to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from a specific treatment. “Until now, the FDA has approved cancer treatments based on where in the body the cancer started - for example, lung or breast cancers,” said Richard Pazdur, head of oncology products for the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. Merck shares rose about 1 percent to $64.65. The accelerated approval was for solid tumor cancers not eligible for surgery or that have spread in patients identified as having a biomarker called microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). Tumors with those traits are most common in colorectal, endometrial and gastrointestinal cancers, but may also appear in  cancers of the breast, prostate, bladder, pancreas, thyroid gland and others. Dr. Drew Pardoll, director of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute that designed and led the trial that led to the historic approval, called it “a marriage of cancer genetics and cancer immunology.” Patients whose tumors are laden with the genetic defect have an abundance of abnormal proteins that look more foreign to immune cells, triggering them to search out and destroy the cancer cells. Keytruda belongs to a new class of drugs called PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors that block a mechanism tumors use to evade detection from cancer-fighting cells. There are now five such drugs available for a variety of cancers. “This was one of those eureka trials where it didn’t take a lot of patients to see this was going to be something major,” Pardoll said in an interview. He said about 4 percent of advanced cancers, or 15,000 to 20,000 cases each year in the United States, carry the genetic traits addressed in the approval. Tests for the specific genetic defects are widely available, costing between $300 and $600. The approval covers children and adults whose cancer has progressed despite prior treatment and those who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options, including patients whose colorectal cancer has progressed following chemotherapy. The FDA grants accelerated approvals to drugs for serious conditions with unmet medical needs if the treatment appears to have effects deemed reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit. Merck must still conduct studies to confirm the anticipated benefit. The approval further solidifies Merck’s leading position in the burgeoning field of treatments that help the immune system fight cancer, a mantle it seized last year when Keytruda extended survival as an initial treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).   Keytruda was previously approved to treat advanced melanoma, advanced NSCLC, head and neck cancers and classical Hodgkin lymphoma.

1145,MRK,UK competition watchdog accuses Merck of obstructing biosimilars,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s competition watchdog has accused Merck & Co of operating an unfair discount scheme for its medicine Remicade that it said was designed to restrict competition from so-called biosimilar copies. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Tuesday it had provisionally found the U.S. company’s European unit, Merck Sharp & Dohme, had abused its dominant position through the scheme, opening it up to potential financial penalties. MSD said it did not believe it had broken competition rules. Remicade, known generically as infliximab, is an antibody drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. The drug is proving an important test for the emerging biosimilars industry. It was the first antibody drug for which copycat versions were approved by European regulators, leading to the launch of discounted products from biosimilar drugmakers including South Korea’s Celltrion, which works with Pfizer. One person familiar with the investigation said MSD offered a discount to customers who continued to buy Remicade in the same quantities but not if they started buying biosimilars, which amounted to an incentive not to switch. Remicade has been a big seller for Merck over the years but sales have been falling in the face of biosimilar competition, declining 29 percent last year to $1.27 billion.

1146,MRK,FDA clears Merck's Keytruda for cancer patients with certain biomarkers,"May 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved Merck & Co’s immuno-oncology treatment, Keytruda, for cancer patients who carry a specific genetic feature. The approval marks the first time the U.S. health regulator has approved a cancer drug based on a biomarker - a biological signal that suggests an increased or decreased risk for a disease. “Until now, the FDA has approved cancer treatments based on where in the body the cancer started — for example, lung or breast cancers,” said Richard Pazdur, acting director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. ""We have now approved a drug based on a tumor's biomarker without regard to the tumor's original location."" (bit.ly/2qh8BQd) Keytruda, which is already approved to treat various cancers, belongs to a new class of drugs, called PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors, that block a mechanism tumors use to evade detection by the immune system. On Tuesday, the FDA approved Keytruda for patients with solid tumors that have been identified as having a biomarker called microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient. The approval covers patients whose cancer has progressed despite prior treatment and those who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. It also includes patients with colorectal cancer whose disease has advanced despite chemotherapy.

1148,MRK,UK competition watchdog accuses Merck of obstructing biosimilars,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s competition watchdog has accused Merck & Co of operating an unfair discount scheme for its medicine Remicade that it said was designed to restrict competition from so-called biosimilar copies. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Tuesday it had provisionally found the U.S. company’s European unit, Merck Sharp & Dohme, had abused its dominant position through the scheme, opening it up to potential financial penalties. MSD said it did not believe it had broken competition rules. Remicade, known generically as infliximab, is an antibody drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. The drug is proving an important test for the emerging biosimilars industry. It was the first antibody drug for which copycat versions were approved by European regulators, leading to the launch of discounted products from biosimilar drugmakers including South Korea’s Celltrion, which works with Pfizer. One person familiar with the investigation said MSD offered a discount to customers who continued to buy Remicade in the same quantities but not if they started buying biosimilars, which amounted to an incentive not to switch. Remicade has been a big seller for Merck over the years but sales have been falling in the face of biosimilar competition, declining 29 percent last year to $1.27 billion.

1154,MRK,Britain backs first-line use of Merck's Keytruda under cancer fund,"LONDON, May 31 (Reuters) - Britain’s cost-effectiveness agency NICE has decided that Merck & Co’s immunotherapy drug Keytruda can be used in previously untreated lung cancer patients under special funding arrangements. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said on Wednesday that it could not recommend routine use of the medicine in newly diagnosed patients, given the drug’s high cost and uncertainties about overall survival benefits. But the agency backed Keytruda use within the Cancer Drugs Fund, signalling that it had the potential to satisfy the criteria for routine use on the National Health Service (NHS) for this group of patients but needs more investigation. The decision follows data presented at a medical meeting last year showing that Keytruda could help lung cancer patients whose tumours have a high level of a protein called PD-L1, which makes them more receptive to immunotherapy. Keytruda is already approved as a cost-effective second-line treatment for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have previously taken chemotherapy but no longer respond. MSD, as Merck is known outside North America, has agreed to provide Keytruda to the NHS at an undisclosed discount.

1168,MRK,Merck heart drug surprises with positive result; questions linger,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co said on Tuesday its experimental cholesterol drug from a class with a history of consistent failure lowered deaths and heart attacks in a large trial, but the company has yet to decide whether to seek approval despite the surprise success. The drugmaker reported only that the drug, anacetrapib, met the main goal in the 4-year trial of about 30,000 high-risk heart patients already on cholesterol-lowering statins. It showed a statistically significant reduction in the combined risk of heart attacks, heart-related death and need for repeat artery-clearing procedures. While announcing the positive result few had expected, given the checkered past of similar medicines, Merck said it plans to review the data with external experts and consider whether to file applications seeking approval. “When they make a statement that we haven’t decided whether to file a new drug application it sends a very strong message,” said Dr. Steven Nissen, chief of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic, who has studied other drugs in the class known as CETP inhibitors. “The fact that they’re hedging their bets ... suggests that the treatment effect may have been relatively small.” Full details of the trial will be presented at a major European heart meeting on Aug. 29. Merck shares, which initially rose more than 2 percent in pre-market trading, were up just 3 cents at $65.95 as uncertainty over the medicine’s future weighed on investors. “We believe it is more prudent to wait for the full data release before drawing broad conclusions on the product’s commercial potential,” Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said. A little over a decade ago, CETP inhibitors were hailed as the next big heart drug due to their ability to dramatically raise HDL, the so-called good cholesterol. Pfizer had been banking on its torcetrapib to replace lost revenue when Lipitor, then the world’s top-selling medicine, lost patent protection. Analysts had forecast more than $10 billion in eventual annual sales. But it became the most expensive failure in pharmaceutical history in late 2006, when Pfizer had to pull the plug on its $800 million Phase III program over an imbalance in deaths and other safety issues. CETP inhibitors from Roche and Eli Lilly and Co subsequently failed due to lack of sufficient efficacy, and other drugs that raise HDL by other mechanisms also failed to show benefit. Merck’s anacetrapib does also lower “bad” LDL cholesterol, which has proven to cut heart attacks and deaths.

Merck shares, which initially rose more than 2 percent in pre-market trading, were up just 3 cents at $65.95 as uncertainty over the medicine’s future weighed on investors. “We believe it is more prudent to wait for the full data release before drawing broad conclusions on the product’s commercial potential,” Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said. A little over a decade ago, CETP inhibitors were hailed as the next big heart drug due to their ability to dramatically raise HDL, the so-called good cholesterol. Pfizer had been banking on its torcetrapib to replace lost revenue when Lipitor, then the world’s top-selling medicine, lost patent protection. Analysts had forecast more than $10 billion in eventual annual sales. But it became the most expensive failure in pharmaceutical history in late 2006, when Pfizer had to pull the plug on its $800 million Phase III program over an imbalance in deaths and other safety issues. CETP inhibitors from Roche and Eli Lilly and Co subsequently failed due to lack of sufficient efficacy, and other drugs that raise HDL by other mechanisms also failed to show benefit. Merck’s anacetrapib does also lower “bad” LDL cholesterol, which has proven to cut heart attacks and deaths.

1173,MRK,"Sales hopes for new Novartis, Merck heart drugs under microscope","LONDON (Reuters) - Novartis and Merck have both surprised experts in the past week by finding new ways to tackle heart disease, although the jury remains out as to whether this scientific success will translate into blockbuster sales. Detailed data on both Novartis’s canakinumab and Merck’s anacetrapib will be presented on Aug. 27 and 29 at the annual meeting of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), conference organizers said on Thursday. So far, the rival companies have only said their drugs met the main goals in two large clinical trials, leaving cardiologists and financial analysts anxious to see the scale of the benefit and the nature of any side effects. That will be crucial in determining commercial demand for premium-priced medicines to prevent heart attacks, at a time when healthcare providers have proved reluctant to pay for other pricey new heart treatments. Novartis’ canakinumab, which is already approved as Ilaris for rare autoimmune conditions, targets inflammation that can aggravate the risks posed by clogged arteries, while Merck’s anacetrapib raises HDL, the so-called good cholesterol. In both cases, many doctors and analysts had been expecting the trials to fail, given disappointments with similar experimental drugs in the past. The double dose of success now opens up the possibility of multibillion-dollar sales. That would be a major boost for both companies, since previous annual sales estimates for the two products by 2022 were only around $500 million apiece, according to consensus estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters. The two drugmakers are not out of the woods yet, however. In the case of canakinumab, U.S. heart expert Milton Packer, of the Baylor University Medical Center at Dallas, said the fact that Novartis’ trial ran six years without being stopped early for superior efficacy suggested its effect might be modest. He predicted, in a blog post, that canakinumab would likely show a 15-20 percent reduction in the risk of a major cardiovascular event, such as heart attack or stroke, without decreasing cardiovascular death by itself. bit.ly/2tsudPz Merck, meanwhile, has already indicated caution about the commercial profile of anacetrapib by saying it has not yet decided whether to file the product for regulatory approval.

1175,MRK,UPDATE 1-FDA puts hold on Merck multiple myeloma trials after deaths,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co (MRK.N) said on Wednesday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had placed a clinical hold on three multiple myeloma studies testing its Keytruda in combination with other medicines for the blood cancer after more deaths were reported in patients receiving the Merck immunotherapy. The rare setback for Keytruda sent Merck shares more than 1 percent lower. Merck has been on a roll with the medicine, jumping to the front of the pack of companies with new immuno-oncology drugs, particularly after Keytruda extended survival as an initial treatment for advanced lung cancer, by far the largest oncology market. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) had been the perceived leader in the field until last year, when its Opdivo failed to match Keytruda’s lung cancer success. Merck last month said it had stopped enrolling patients in the trials testing Keytruda in combination with standard multiple myeloma regimens including Celgene Corp (CELG.O) drugs. The decision was taken after independent safety monitors observed more deaths in patients receiving the Keytruda combination than in the control groups in two of the studies. The FDA said based on available data the risks of combining Keytruda with either of the Celgene medicines outweigh any potential benefit for patients with multiple myeloma. The trials were testing Keytruda with either Revlimid or Pomalyst and dexamethasone against the regimens without Keytruda. All patients who were receiving Keytruda in combination with a Celgene drug will no longer take the Merck drug. The clinical hold does not apply to other studies with Keytruda, Merck said. The drug, which helps the immune system fight cancer by blocking a protein tumors use to avoid detection, is currently being tested in hundreds of combination trials in a wide variety of cancers. So far, Keytruda is only approved for one type of blood cancer, classical Hodgkin lymphoma. But Merck has had a string of successes in solid tumor cancers with approvals for advanced melanoma, advanced bladder cancer and a type of head and neck cancer, in addition to lung. In May, Keytruda became the first cancer drug to win U.S.  approval based on a patient’s specific genetic traits, regardless of where in the body the disease originated, known as microsatellite instability-high cancer.

1184,MRK,UPDATE 1-Trump unveils companies' $500 million U.S. drug packaging project,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Thursday announced a $500 million investment that Corning Inc is making with pharmaceutical giants Merck and Pfizer to manufacture a new kind of glass for injectable drug vials. At a White House event, Trump said the effort will create nearly 1,000 jobs at facilities in New York and New Jersey and at a soon-to-be-determined site in the southeastern United States.

The commitments were made as part of Trump’s “Made in America” week, during which he has showcased American-made products and made an impassioned defense of his “America First” policies. Corning said it developed the new type of glass in collaboration with the drugmakers. “This initiative will bring a key industry to our shores that for too long has been dominated by foreign countries. We’re moving more and more companies back into the United States,” Trump said. After the remarks, Trump tested the strength of the new Corning Valor Vial.

1185,MRK,FDA tentatively approves Merck's copycat of Sanofi's Lantus,"(Reuters) - Merck and Co Inc said on Thursday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) tentatively approved its biosimilar version of French drugmaker Sanofi SA’s blockbuster diabetes treatment, Lantus. Merck’s copycat, if launched, would challenge Lantus as a cheaper alternative that could chip away at the drug’s sales, which reached 5.71 billion euros ($6.6 billion) last year and represented over a sixth of Sanofi’s total sales. Though the FDA said Merck’s product was similar enough to Lantus to justify approval, the agency’s final greenlight is subject to the resolution of a patent infringement suit brought by Sanofi against the U.S. drugmaker. The litigation, filed in September, triggered a stay on final FDA approval for up to 30 months, unless a court rules in favor of Merck earlier. Biosimilars are cheaper copies of protein-based biotech drugs such as Lantus, which are no longer protected by patents. They have been shown to have similar efficacy and side effects as the originals. But biosimilars have become involved in many Big Pharma patent tussles in recent years, whose time in court serves less to gain victory than to delay the launch of rival knock-offs. After Lantus’s U.S. patent expired in 2015, Sanofi had hoped to revive diabetes drug revenue that had declined due to pricing pressure and competition, by launching a follow-on product called Toujeo in March that year. Toujeo raked in 649 million euros in sales last year. Eli Lilly & Co’s Lantus biosimilar, Basaglar, won tentative FDA approval in August 2014 but litigation brought by Sanofi delayed final approval to December 2016. Lilly agreed to pay Sanofi royalties as part of the settlement. Basaglar generated $86.1 million in sales last year. U.S. pharmacy benefit manager CVS in August said it would drop Lantus from the list of medicines it reimburses on behalf of health insurers, dealing a blow to the French drugmaker’s diabetes business. Merck’s Lantus biosimilar, called Lusduna Nexvue, is being developed with funding from South Korea’s Samsung Bioepis, and delivers insulin in a pre-filled dosing device. Both Lantus and Lusduna Nexvue, administered via injection, are long-acting, man-made versions of human insulin.

Though the FDA said Merck’s product was similar enough to Lantus to justify approval, the agency’s final greenlight is subject to the resolution of a patent infringement suit brought by Sanofi against the U.S. drugmaker. The litigation, filed in September, triggered a stay on final FDA approval for up to 30 months, unless a court rules in favor of Merck earlier. After Lantus’s U.S. patent expired in 2015, Sanofi had hoped to revive diabetes drug revenue that had declined due to pricing pressure and competition, by launching a follow-on product called Toujeo in March that year. Toujeo raked in 649 million euros in sales last year. Eli Lilly & Co’s Lantus follow-on biologic, Basaglar, won tentative FDA approval in August 2014 but litigation brought by Sanofi delayed final approval to December 2016. Lilly agreed to pay Sanofi royalties as part of the settlement. Basaglar generated $86.1 million in sales last year. U.S. pharmacy benefit manager CVS in August said it would drop Lantus from the list of medicines it reimburses on behalf of health insurers, dealing a blow to the French drugmaker’s diabetes business. Merck’s Lantus follow-on biologic, called Lusduna Nexvue, is being developed with funding from South Korea’s Samsung Bioepis, and delivers insulin in a pre-filled dosing device. Both Lantus and Lusduna Nexvue, administered via injection, are long-acting, man-made versions of human insulin. Shares of Merck were up 0.8 percent at $63.11 in afternoon trading, while Sanofi’s New York-listed stock was up 3 percent.

1194,MRK,"Merck, Samsung Bioepis launch discounted U.S. Remicade alternative","NEW YORK/SEOUL (Reuters) - Merck & Co and South Korea’s Samsung Bioepis Co Ltd said on Monday they have begun selling a less expensive alternative version of Johnson & Johnson’s rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade in the United States, a move that should accelerate price declines for the big-selling medicine. The U.S. and Korean drugmakers said they would sell their version, to be called Renflexis, at 35 percent discount to the list price of J&J;’s top-selling medicine, or about $735 for a 100 milligram dose. J&J; shares were down 1.6 percent at $133.16. Renflexis is the second U.S. biosimilar version of Remicade to be sold after Pfizer Inc launched its Inflectra late last year at a 15 percent discount to J&J;’s list price, later dropped to a 19 percent discount. Remicade had U.S. sales of $4.8 billion last year. They fell 8.2 percent for the first half of 2017 to $2.2 billion with the new competition. As with generic medicines, once multiple biosimilars of a drug become available prices are expected to drop more quickly. Many industry executives and analysts have expressed surprise at how fast prices have fallen in Europe, which led the way with biosimilars. Merck sells the branded version of Remicade outside the United States. In Europe, it is already facing competition from biosimilar Remicade and cheaper versions of other medicines in the class. Many companies are developing a wide range of biosimilar versions of top-selling biologic medicines, including major biotechs like Amgen Inc, which is working on cheaper versions of several of its rivals’ blockbuster drugs. J&J;, in a statement, said it offers a variety of discounts and rebates off the list price of Remicade, giving it an average sales price of $808.87 per 100mg vial. J&J;’s Janssen unit sought a preliminary or permanent U.S. injunction to block the Bioepis version, arguing that it infringed three of its patents. A hearing for the lawsuit has yet to be scheduled. “We are confident we do not infringe on Janssen’s patents,” Samsung Bioepis spokesman Mingi Hyun said. Renflexis, which received U.S. approval in April, is the first medicine available in the United States under a global biosimilars agreement between Merck and Samsung Bioepis, a unit of Samsung BioLogics Co Ltd.

1202,MRK,"Merck says cyber attack halted production, will hurt profits","NEW YORK/LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Drug and vaccine maker Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) said it suffered a worldwide disruption of its operations when it was the victim of an international cyber attack in June, halting production of its drugs, which will hurt its profits for the rest of the year. The company said it does not yet understand the full magnitude of the impact as it is in the process of restoring manufacturing operations. It disclosed the attack last month, but did not disclose the manufacturing shutdown at the time.  Merck said it was confident that it will be able to maintain a continuous supply of its top-selling and life-saving drugs, including cancer drug Keytruda, diabetes drug Januvia and hepatitis C drug Zepatier. But it warned of temporary delays in delivering some other products, which it did not identify.  “Full recovery from the cyber-attack will take some time, but we are making steady progress,” Chief Executive Ken Frazier said on a conference call as the company reported quarterly results. Merck is the latest in a string of corporations to disclose that operations were significantly disrupted by the NotPetya attack, which devastated businesses and government agencies in Ukraine a month ago and has gradually spread around the globe. Security sources said they expect more to come forward in the coming weeks. Package delivery company FedEx Corp (FDX.N), shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), Cadbury chocolate parent Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) and British consumer goods maker Reckitt Benckiser (RB.L) have also said their operations were disrupted by the attack. At least four other major U.S. and European firms have also experienced massive outages due to NotPetya, but have held off on going public as they seek to restore systems, said a person familiar with those efforts. The source declined to identify the victims, saying the firms were not ready to go public.  NotPetya is a destructive virus capable of spreading quickly across computer networks, crippling computers by encrypting hard drives so that machines cannot run. The attacks have caused massive disruptions to industrial networks that rely on computers because businesses must individually replace damaged drives, a labor-intensive process.   The impact on Merck was particularly troubling because it affected the firm’s ability to produce medicines, said Joshua Corman, director of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council.  “This is serious. It affects human lives,” Corman said. “Imagine if the supply of something like H5N1 influenza vaccine was affected when we needed them.” Ukraine officials have blamed Russia for the attack, claims which Moscow has vehemently denied.  Cyber security experts have said they believe the virus was intended to cripple Ukraine, but that it spread to global corporations whose networks were connected to Ukraine. Merck’s quarterly profit blew past analysts’ estimates as demand surged for top selling cancer drug Keytruda and the company reined in expenses. Net income rose to $1.95 billion, or 71 cents per share, in the second quarter, from $1.21 billion, or 43 cents per share, a year earlier. Sales of Keytruda, which works by taking the brakes off the immune system, nearly tripled to $881 million in the second quarter, handily beating consensus estimates of $777 million, according to Barclays. Sales inched up about 1 percent to $9.93 billion. Analysts, on average, had expected $9.75 billion. Excluding items, Merck earned $1.01 per share, above analysts’ average estimate of 87 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Merck reduced its full-year net profit forecast to between $1.60 per share and $1.72 per share due to expenses from a collaboration with AstraZeneca announced Thursday.

1203,MRK,"UPDATE 3-AbbVie to remain cautious on drug pricing, shares fall","(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc’s (ABBV.N) said it would be cautious with drug pricing, especially for Humira, the world’s biggest selling drug, sending its shares down 2 percent, despite the drugmaker’s quarterly profit narrowly beating estimates. Abbvie CEO Richard Gonzalez said on Friday the company would continue to be “careful and conservative” about pricing, even though the drugmaker has already concluded negotiations with insurers for coverage of its Humira drug in 2017 and 2018.  “I’d say even in this last cycle, we have been even a little more conservative than we have been in the past because this (drug pricing) has become such a heated topic in the United States,” Gonzalez said. AbbVie had in January pledged to limit drug price hikes to under 10 percent and once a year, as political and payer scrutiny into drug pricing intensified in United States. Overall sales of Humira, which is used to treat autoimmune disorders and has a list price of $4,441 for a two-pen pack, rose 13.7 percent to $4.72 billion, beating analysts’ average estimate of $4.64 billion, according to Barclays. The drug’s U.S. sales rose 18 percent, driven by pricing as well as low double-digit prescription growth, AbbVie executives said.  However, the blockbuster drug faces looming competition from copycat versions in the United States. AbbVie has been trying to block the launch of Amgen’s (AMGN.O) Humira knock-off.  Earlier this year, the U.S. patent office ruled in favor of Coherus Biosciences’ (CHRS.O) Humira copy, in a move that analysts say could advance its U.S. launch by a year. AbbVie’s cancer drug Imbruvica, which it jointly owns with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), raked in sales of $626 million, above the consensus estimate of $609 million. Sales of its hepatitis C treatment, Viekira Pak, came at $225 million, well below the consensus estimate of $257 million, as rival products from Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) and Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) ate into sales.  AbbVie said regulatory decisions on its next-generation hepatitis C treatment, Maviret, are expected in the coming weeks. If approved, the company expects to see a meaningful impact to sales only in 2018.   Excluding items, the company earned $1.42 per share, beating analysts’ estimates by 2 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. AbbVie’s net revenue rose to $6.94 billion, edging past estimates of $6.93 billion. Shares of the company, which maintained its adjusted profit forecast for 2017, were down at $70.34 in afternoon trading.

1205,MRK,CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Bayer cuts profit forecast after consumer health headache,"(Corrects second and third paragraph in story from July 26 to clarify Aleve was Bayer brand, not legacy Merck & Co brand) * Now sees core earnings growth this year below 10 pct * Coppertone, Claritin, Aleve sales drop * Shares fall as much as 4 percent * Records negative crop science revenue in Latam By Ludwig Burger FRANKFURT, July 27 (Reuters) - Bayer, which is buying U.S. seeds company Monsanto, cut its forecast for operating profit growth this year to below 10 percent after declines in sales of consumer health products in the United States and crop chemicals in Brazil. Sales of sunscreen Coppertone and allergy remedy Claritin, among the main brands it bought from Merck & Co in 2014, each slumped more than 10 percent in the second quarter, hit by fierce competition in the United States. Painkiller Aleve, an established Bayer brand, also suffered declines of more than 10 percent. Bayer shares fell more than 4 percent and were down 2.9 percent at 1105 GMT, underperforming the STOXX Europe 600 Health Care index, which was also being dragged down by a slump in AstraZeneca following a drug study setback. Germany’s biggest drugmaker said it expected 2017 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to rise by a “high-single-digit percentage”, whereas it had previously forecast “low-teens percentage” growth. “We were negatively surprised by the substantial downgrade to consumer health guidance,” Equinet analyst Marietta Miemietz said. Bayer flagged early this year that some consumer brands were in worse shape than it had appeared during the bidding for the $14 billion Merck assets and their performance had been further complicated by consolidation among U.S. drugstore chains. Bayer warned last month that poor sales at crop protection distributors in Brazil and a weaker than expected consumer health business would hit earnings by at least 300 million euros ($342 million). Operating earnings at its Crop Science division, which plans to complete the Monsanto merger this year, fell by more than half, hit by 355 million euros in charges from provisions for product returns and writedowns on inventories and receivables in Brazil. Major rivals in pesticides such as BASF and DuPont have flagged punishing conditions in Brazil. But unlike Bayer they were not caught out by major surplus volumes in distribution channels, which forced the Bayer division to chalk up negative Latin America sales for the quarter after taking back products from distributors’ shelves. Bayer’s adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter came in at 3.06 million euros, slightly higher than last year and the average forecast by analysts, helped by a boost in margins at plastics business Covestro and continued growth in prescriptions for anti-clotting drug Xarelto. Bayer is expected to release long-awaited details on a successful drugs trial that could expand the cardiovascular conditions that Xarelto can treat at the end of August.

Net income attributable to Merck rose to $1.95 billion, or 71 cents per share, for the second quarter, from $1.21 billion, or 43 cents per share, a year earlier.

1213,MRK,UPDATE 8-Merck CEO resigns from Trump council over Charlottesville,"(Adds new Trump tweet on Merck) By Michael Erman Aug 14 (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc Chief Executive Kenneth Frazier resigned from U.S. President Donald Trump’s American Manufacturing Council on Monday, saying he was taking a stand against intolerance and extremism. Trump denounced neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan as criminals and thugs on Monday, bowing to mounting political pressure after initially saying many sides were to blame after a white-nationalist rally turned deadly in Virginia. Frazier, who is African-American, is the only CEO so far to leave one of Trump’s advisory councils because of his reaction to the violence in Virginia, although the AFL-CIO said it was considering pulling its representative on the committee. Prominent Democrats and Republicans criticized Trump’s response to the violence over the weekend. The gathering of hundreds of white nationalists took a deadly turn on Saturday when a car plowed into a group of counter-protesters and killed at least one person. Trump had said “many sides” were involved, drawing fire from across the political spectrum for not specifically denouncing the far right. ""America's leaders must honor our fundamental views by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,"" Frazier said in a statement announcing his resignation. (bit.ly/2fFnITM) “As CEO of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism,” he said. Trump responded shortly after in a tweet, saying that now “Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President’s Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!” Trump doubled down on his attack later in the day, tweeting that Merck “is a leader in higher & higher drug prices while at the same time taking jobs out of the U.S. Bring jobs back & LOWER PRICES!” The son of a janitor, Frazier joined Merck as general counsel of one of the drugmaker’s subsidiaries in 1992, working his way up to CEO of the company in 2011. He made his name as the company’s top lawyer, steering it through daunting litigation over Vioxx, its widely used painkiller that was withdrawn in 2004 after being linked to heart attacks. Many observers thought Merck would eventually have to shell out $10 billion or more to thousands of plaintiffs over the drug’s withdrawal. But Frazier’s legal strategy led to a $4.85 billion settlement in 2007, allowing Merck to refocus on its pipeline of experimental medicines. Merck shares rose 0.5 percent in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, roughly in line with the wider market. Frazier frequently made political contributions during the 2016 election, donating to both Republican and Democratic members of Congress but making no donations to a presidential candidate during the year. The political PAC maintained by Merck and funded through donations from Merck employees made over $1.1 million in candidate contributions during the 2016 campaign - but did not contribute to Trump or his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, according to documents filed with the Federal Elections Commission. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, which represents the pharmaceutical industry and lobbies on its behalf in Congress, declined to offer a statement of support for Frazier or to comment on Trump’s reaction. The industry’s silence comes as Trump is finalizing an executive order on drug prices that would relax industry regulation and contains measures that, some say, would protect existing drug prices or even increase them. Individually, at least one CEO, John Maraganore of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, tweeted his support, saying he was “proud to stand with leaders like Ken Frazier.” Other top business leaders also spoke out in response to the violence in Charlottesville. “I support Ken Frazier’s decision. I’m thankful we have business leaders such as Ken to remind America of its better angels,” said Hewlett Packard Enterprises CEO Meg Whitman, who ran for governor of California as a Republican in 2010. Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein tweeted: “Lincoln: ‘A house divided against itself cannot stand.’ Isolate those who try to separate us. No equivalence w/ those who bring us together.” Richard Trumka, president of the largest federation of U.S. labor unions, the AFL-CIO, questioned the council’s effectiveness and said the group was mulling leaving. “The AFL-CIO has unequivocally denounced the actions of bigoted domestic terrorists in Charlottesville and called on the president to do the same,” Trumka said in a statement. Several executives from top U.S. companies have previously stepped down from a number of presidential advisory councils in protest to Trump policies. Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger left the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum, a business advisory group, in June, after Trump said he would withdraw from the Paris climate accord. Musk also left the manufacturing council. Former Uber Technologies Inc CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council in February amid pressure from activists and employees who opposed the administration’s immigration policies. The White House said Sunday that Trump’s remarks condemning violence at a white nationalist rally were meant to include the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi groups. Democrats and Republicans criticized Trump for waiting too long to address the violence - his first major domestic crisis as president - and for failing when he did speak out to explicitly condemn white-supremacist marchers who ignited the melee. Trump on Saturday initially denounced what he called “this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.” On Sunday, however, the White House added: “The president said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry, and hatred, and of course that includes white supremacists, KKK, neo-Nazi, and all extremist groups. He called for national unity and bringing all Americans together.” ",8142017,http://www.reuters.com/article/virginia-protests-merck/update-8-merck-ceo-resigns-from-trump-council-over-charlottesville-idUSL2N1L00I9

1218,MRK,"Trump yields to pressure, calls neo-Nazis and KKK criminals","CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump denounced neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan as criminals and thugs on Monday, bowing to mounting political pressure to condemn such groups explicitly after a white-nationalist rally turned deadly in Virginia. Trump had been assailed from across the political spectrum for failing to respond more forcefully to Saturday’s violence in Charlottesville. The head Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N), one of the world’s biggest pharmaceutical companies, quit a presidential business panel as a result, saying he was taking a stand against intolerance and extremism. The chief executives of two other prominent companies - sportswear manufacturer Under Armour (UAA.N) and semiconductor chip maker Intel Corp (INTC.O) - followed suit hours later. Critics denounced Trump for waiting too long to address the bloodshed, and for initially faulting hatred and violence “on many sides,” rather than singling out the white supremacists widely seen as instigating the melee. Democrats said Trump’s reaction belied a reluctance to alienate white nationalists and “alt-right” political activists who occupy a loyal segment of Trump’s political base. Several senators from his own Republican Party had harsh words for him. Some 48 hours into the biggest domestic challenge of his young presidency, Trump tried to correct course. “Racism is evil, and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans,” the president said in a statement to reporters at the White House on Monday. “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence,” he said. A 20-year-old man said to have harbored Nazi sympathies was arrested on charges of plowing his car into protesters opposing the white nationalists, killing 32-year-old paralegal Heather Heyer and injuring 19 people. The accused, James Fields, was denied bail at a court hearing on Monday. Several others were arrested in connection with street brawls during the day that left another 15 people injured. And two airborne state troopers involved in crowd control were killed when their helicopter crashed. Saturday’s disturbances erupted after white nationalists converged in Charlottesville, home of the University of Virginia’s flagship campus, to protest plans for removing a statue of General Robert E. Lee, commander of the pro-slavery Confederate army of the U.S. Civil War.     Trump’s belated denunciation of white supremacists by name was welcomed by Heyer’s mother, Susan Bro, who thanked the president for what she called “those words of comfort and for denouncing those who promote violence and hatred.” But not everyone was mollified.  “I wish that he would have said those same words on Saturday,” responded Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia on MSNBC. “I’m disappointed it took him a couple of days.” A group of community leaders meeting in Charlottesville likewise said they were unimpressed by Trump’s latest message. “Why did it take criticism from his Republican buddies to move him ... to adjust the moral compass that he does not possess?” said Don Gathers, who serves as chairman for the city’s commission on monuments and memorials.  Trump lashed out at his critics late on Monday on Twitter: “Made additional remarks on Charlottesville and realize once again that the #Fake News Media will never be satisfied...truly bad people!”  Trump’s revised statement on Charlottesville, following a day of silence despite a rising chorus of outrage over the violence, came after the chief executive of Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) delivered one of the more noteworthy rebukes of the president. Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier, who is black, resigned from Trump’s American Manufacturing Council, saying expressions of hatred and bigotry must be rejected. Trump quickly hit back on Twitter, but made no reference to Frazier’s reasons for quitting the panel, instead revisiting a longstanding gripe about expensive medicines. Frazier would have more time to focus on lowering “ripoff” drug prices, Trump tweeted. Frazier’s resignation was followed hours later by two other members of the business panel quitting in protest, Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank and Intel chief Brian Krzanich. “I resigned to call attention to the serious harm our divided political climate is causing to critical issues, including the serious need to address the decline of American manufacturing,” Krzanich wrote in a blog post.  The AFL-CIO organized labor federation that represents 12.5 million workers said it, too, was considering pulling its representative from the committee. The jarring images of violence from Charlottesville and the heated public debate over racism resonated around the world, particularly in Europe where leaders are contending with a wave of xenophobia.   German Chancellor Angela Merkel told broadcaster Phoenix on Monday that clear and forceful action must be taken to counter right-wing extremism, and that “we have quite a lot to do at home ourselves.” About 130 people demonstrated outside the U.S. Embassy in London, some with placards reading “Fascism is not to be debated, it is to be smashed,” and “I am an ashamed American.” The United Nations said there must be no place in today’s societies for the violent racism, anti-Semitism, xenophobia and discrimination on display in Charlottesville. About 500 protesters assembled in front of the White House for a “Reject White Supremacy” rally, then marched to Trump’s hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue nearby. In Manhattan, thousands of demonstrators stood outside Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue shouting “No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA.” In Durham, North Carolina, a crowd of demonstrators stormed the site of a Confederate monument outside a court and toppled the bronze statue from its base. Television news footage showed protesters taking turns stomping and kicking the fallen statue as dozens cheered. Hundreds of miles to the north, a Holocaust memorial in Boston was vandalized, but police said they quickly arrested a 17-year-old boy who was grabbed by onlookers who saw him shatter one of the monument’s glass panels with a rock. Asked on Monday whether one side was more responsible for the violence than another in Charlottesville, Police Chief Al Thomas said: “This was an alt-right rally” - using the term that has become a banner for various far-right ideologies that includes neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites.   Fields appeared in a Charlottesville court on Monday by video link from the jail where he was being held on a second-degree murder charge, three counts of malicious wounding and a single count of leaving the scene of a fatal accident. His next court date was set for Aug. 25. Several students who attended high school with Fields in Kentucky described him as an angry young man who passionately espoused white supremacist ideology. The U.S. Justice Department was pressing its own federal investigation of the incident as a hate crime.

Trump on Saturday initially denounced what he called “this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.” On Sunday, however, the White House added: “The president said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry, and hatred, and of course that includes white supremacists, KKK, neo-Nazi, and all extremist groups. He called for national unity and bringing all Americans together.” ",8152017,http://www.reuters.com/article/virginia-protests-merck/update-10-three-ceos-resign-from-trump-council-over-charlottesville-idUSL2N1L1016
1221,MRK,FDA expands use of AstraZeneca/Merck ovarian cancer drug,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday expanded the use of Lynparza, sold by AstraZeneca Plc and Merck & Co Inc, to include ongoing treatment of patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who have responded to platinum-based chemotherapy. The agency also approved a new two-tablet regimen for the drug, regardless of whether patients test positive for BRCA genetic mutations associated with high risk for the cancer. The drug was previously approved for treating advanced ovarian cancer in women who had stopped responding to at least three earlier rounds of chemotherapy. Lynparza, known chemically as olaparib, belongs to a class of drugs called PARP inhibitors. The broader U.S. approval makes Lynparza more competitive with rival PARP inhibitor Zejula, sold by Tesaro Inc, according to Baird Equity analyst Michael Ulz. AstraZeneca announced last month a deal with Merck to develop and commercialize Lynparza, including in combination with other cancer drugs such as Merck’s Keytruda immunotherapy. In an emailed statement, AstraZeneca said the companies plan to file sometime in the second half of this year for approval of Lynparza as a treatment for breast cancer. The drug is also being investigated in prostate and pancreatic cancer.

1224,MRK,Fitch Affirms Merck at 'A'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, August 17 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Merck & Co., Inc.'s Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A' with a Stable Rating Outlook. The ratings apply to roughly $28.4 billion of debt outstanding at June 30, 2017. KEY RATING DRIVERS New Products/Growth Opportunities: Products approved during the last three years should help to drive intermediate- to long-term, top-line growth for Merck. Most importantly, Keytruda (cancer) is gaining traction in the market, supported by an ongoing stream of clinical data, but it will continue to face competition from Bristol-Myers and Pfizer/Bayer, which have similar-acting drugs. Merck is also evaluating Keytruda's safety and efficacy in other cancers and in combination with other oncolytics. Zinplava (Clostridium difficile antitoxin) will address a significant unmet medical need, and Zepatier (hepatitis C) entered an increasingly crowded market but should be able to gain some share. Expanding Late-Stage Pipeline: Fitch expects Merck to continue to build its late-stage pipeline with new therapies to treat cancers, infectious diseases, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, central nervous afflictions, osteoporosis, and other diseases. While the majority of these projects are internally developed, Merck also partners with innovator firms to take advantage of technological advancements that were discovered externally. Given the breadth and pace of new drug discovery and development, Fitch believes that it is advantageous for firms to look externally as well as internally to optimally build their pipelines. Patent Exposure Manageable: Merck is facing generic and biosimilar competition to Zetia, Vytorin and Remicade. However, Fitch views the risk as manageable with roughly 14% of firm sales at risk. Remicade, which accounts for about 3.2% of total firm sales, is a biologic that will likely experience less rapid sales losses to biosimilar competition once a biosimilar is launched, compared to traditional small-molecule pharmaceuticals when a generic enters the market. Merck recently launched its own biosimilar version of Remicade in the U.S. Vytorin and Zetia are small molecules and account for roughly 9% of total revenues. Sales erosion for these two drugs has been rapid. Solid Free Cash Flow Expected: Fitch forecasts that Merck will generate $5.2 billion to $5.4 billion in free cash flow (FCF) during 2017. Improving margins driven by an sales mix and strong cost control should more than offset expected soft near-term, top-line growth. Fitch expects FCF to incrementally increase during the multi-year forecast period due to moderately improving margins and stronger top-line growth. Targeted Acquisition Likely: Fitch looks for Merck to pursue mainly targeted acquisitions in the intermediate term. The company has improved its operational and financial prospects through successfully gaining regulatory approvals on late-stage pipeline projects and has continued to back fill its pipeline with new and advancing projects. An improved growth and profitability profile decreases the need for the company to execute large strategic business combinations in order to fill pipeline gaps or offset sales losses from patent expiries. Share Repurchases to Continue: Fitch assumes continued shareholder friendly actions during the near term; Merck has occasionally funded its share repurchases with debt. During the latest 12-month (LTM) period ended June 30, 2017, the company purchased a net $3 billion of its common stock, compared to $3.5 billion during the prior LTM period. The repurchases were executed under a $10 billion program authorized in March 2015. As of June 30, 2017, the company's remaining share repurchase authorization was $3.5 billion. Payers Increasingly Demanding Value: While drug pricing is always near the top of contentious issues in healthcare, it has become increasingly so during the past two years. Some of the scrutiny has been self-inflicted by a few firms pursuing significant price increases on long-established drugs. Other concerns surround the high price points of recently approved innovative drugs. Regardless, pharmaceutical manufacturers will increasingly need to demonstrate the value of their therapies to payers, patients and providers with strong clinical outcomes driven by increased safety and efficacy. This dynamic will place further pressure on the research and development efforts of innovative biopharmaceutical firms. DERIVATION SUMMARY Merck & Co., Inc.'s (Merck) 'A' rating reflects the favorable aspects of the company's operating profile relative to innovative pharmaceutical industry peers Eli Lilly and Bristol Myers in terms of scale, breadth, depth, geographic reach and patent risk. Merck's intermediate-term patent risk is manageable, and an advancing pipeline will offset some sales losses, supporting the prospects for operational and financial stability. Gross leverage durably below 2.2 times (x), is supportive of the company's 'A' rating. Merck's most relevant peer is Pfizer. Pfizer is similar to Merck in terms of innovative drug sales, depth and breadth of pipeline, geographic reach and patent expiry risk. However, Merck's established (branded-generic) drug portfolio is significantly smaller than Pfizer's. Fitch rates Pfizer 'A+'/Outlook Negative with a gross debt to EBITDA sensitivity of 1.4x to 1.7x for its current rating. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for Merck include: --Low single-digit revenue growth during the forecast period, driven by newer products, partly offset in the near term by select product patent expiries. --Incremental margin improvement driven by a focus on costs and an improving sales mix. --Annual FCF (cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures minus dividends) of roughly $5.3 billion during 2017. --Targeted acquisitions prioritized over strategic, transformative transactions. --Continued significant share repurchases. --Leverage to generally range between 1.6x-1.9x during the forecast period. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action --Improving operations including new product development that support long-term positive revenue growth and margin stability/increases; --An operational profile that would consistently generate significantly positive FCF, despite the potential regulatory and reimbursement headwinds; --A commitment and ability to adhere to a cash deployment strategy that maintains gross debt leverage durably below 1.7x, including managing through operational stress such as patent expiries. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action --Material and lasting deterioration in operations and FCF, possibly driven by patent expiries not being offset by new product development or secular regulatory or other operating headwinds; --Leveraging acquisitions without the prospect of timely debt/leverage reduction; --Persistent leverage above 2.2x. LIQUIDITY Adequate Liquidity/Manageable Maturities: Merck has adequate liquidity, including full availability on a $6 billion revolving credit facility. Liquidity is bolstered by robust cash generation. At June 30, 2017, the company had $7.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $4.2 billion in available-for-sale debt securities; much of Merck's cash balance is located outside of the U.S. Fitch expects liquidity to remain strong throughout the ratings horizon. The company generated roughly $3.4 billion in FCF during the LTM period ended June 30, 2017. Debt maturities are manageable with $3 billion maturing in 2018, $1.25 billion in 2019, $1.950 billion in 2020 and $2.3 billion in 2021. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Merck & Co., Inc. --Long-Term IDR at 'A'; --Credit facility at 'A'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'A'; --Short-Term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper at 'F1'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

1226,MRK,Merck cholesterol drug cuts heart risk by 9 pct in study,"Aug 29 (Reuters) - A large study of Merck & Co Inc’s experimental cholesterol drug anacetrapib found that it cut the risk of heart attack and death by a modest 9 percent, which could be due to its affect on bad LDL cholesterol, researchers said on Tuesday. Merck said it had not decided whether to seek regulatory approval in the United States and elsewhere for anacetrapib - part of a class known as CETP inhibitors designed to raise HDL, the so-called good cholesterol. The company, which announced in June that the trial had met its main goal, also repeated previous findings that prolonged use led to build up of the drug in fat tissue. A little over a decade ago, CETP inhibitors were hailed as the next big heart drug but companies including Pfizer Inc , Eli Lilly and Roche eventually scrapped development programs amid lack of efficacy or safety issues. On Tuesday, Merck presented in Barcelona at the European Society of Cardiology Congress results from its 4-year trial of about 30,000 high-risk heart patients already on statin drugs. Statin drugs lower levels of LDL cholesterol. The study, also published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that adding anacetrapib to a statin reduced the combined risk of heart attack, heart-related death and need for repeat artery-clearing procedures to 10.8 percent, compared with 11.8 percent for patients on a placebo and a statin. The trial, led by the University of Oxford and funded by Merck, did not find a significant difference in the risk of ischemic stroke. The researchers, writing in the New England Journal of Medicine, noted that anacetrapib raised blood levels of good cholesterol by a mean of 43 mg per deciliter compared to the placebo. The drug also lowered levels of non-HDL cholesterol by 17 mg per deciliter - a level associated with a 10 percent reduction in the risk of coronary death or heart attack. “This result reduces the likelihood that other actions of anacetrapib played a major role in modifying the risk of coronary events,” researchers concluded. Merck said safety data was generally consistent with earlier trials - anacetrapib patients had slightly higher blood pressure levels than the placebo group - but an analysis showed that the experimental drug accumulates in adipose tissue. It found that the amount of anacetrapib in fat tissue fell only a small amount a year after treatment ended. Merck said animal studies have not indicated harmful effects of anacetrapib in adipose structure or function, but a planned two-year follow up of patients is expected to provide information on longer term effects.

1228,MRK,Merck & Co snaps up three year-old German biotech firm for up to $550 million,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - U.S. pharma group Merck & Co (MRK.N) has acquired 3-1/2 year old German biotech start-up Rigontec for up to 464 million euros ($554 million), adding a new approach to its development of drugs that spur the immune system to attack tumors.

Rigontec just started testing its most advanced compound RGT100 on humans in May, banking on a mechanism of action called RIG-I which is designed to trigger a long-term response of the innate immune system, the body’s first line of defense against infections. Rival Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) last month banked on a similar medical approach when it agreed to buy IFM Therapeutics for an upfront payment of $300 million.

1229,MRK,Bristol-Myers says FDA places partial hold on Opdivo myeloma trials,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has placed a partial hold on three clinical trials testing Bristol-Myers Squibb’s immunotherapy Opdivo in combination with other medicines for multiple myeloma due to risks seen in similar studies involving a rival drug, the company said on Wednesday. Patients with relapsed multiple myeloma taking part in the trials who were experiencing clinical benefit will be allowed to continue treatment, but no new patients will be enrolled for now, Bristol Myers said. The FDA in July placed a hold on three Merck & Co multiple myeloma trials testing its Keytruda along with other standard medicines for the blood cancer following reports of more deaths in patients who received Keytruda than in the control arms of the studies. Opdivo and Keytruda belong to a high-profile new class of drugs called PD-1 inhibitors that work by blocking a mechanism tumors use to hide from the immune system, allowing it to detect and attack cancer. “The FDA determined data currently available from non-Opdivo studies indicate the risks of PD-1/PD-L1 treatment plus pomalidomide or lenalidomide and possibly PD-1/PD-L1 treatments alone or with other combinations outweigh potential benefit for patients with multiple myeloma,” Bristol-Myers said on its website. Lenalidomide and pomalidomide are the widely used Celgene Corp multiple myeloma treatments Revlimid and Pomalyst. “BMS remains steadfast in our commitment to improve outcomes for patients with multiple myeloma, and will work closely with the FDA to address concerns,” the company said in a statement.

1238,MRK,Police search Merck KGaA's French plant in thyroid pill inquiry,"LYON, France (Reuters) - French police searched German drugmaker Merck KGaA’s plant in Lyon on Tuesday as part of an investigation into complaints by patients about changes to its thyroid drug Levothyrox, a company spokeswoman said. A Merck KGaA spokeswoman said the company was “ready to help investigators with their work.” The search was carried out by a unit of the national police responsible for public health, which was not immediately available to comment. Around 3 million people in France, 80 percent of them women, use Levothyrox, a drug that works as a stand-in for the hormone thyroxine in patients suffering from hypothyroidism, a condition that affects the body’s metabolism. In March, Merck GKaA removed lactose from the drug to make it easier to tolerate and replaced it with citric acid and mannitol, a type of sugar alcohol, a move which thousands of patients said had resulted in severe side effects such as memory loss, hair loss, weight gain and palpitations. The new formulation had been requested by the French medicines regulator ANSM in 2012. In September, a prosecutor in Marseille launched an investigation into whether Merck KGaA had deceived patients with the change in the drug’s formula. Since then, Merck KGaA has restored the original drug to the market in the face of widespread media coverage in France. It will remain on shelves alongside the new formulation until other treatments are available.

1240,MRK,Roche bladder cancer drug struggles as medics focus on survival,"LONDON (Reuters) - Roche’s immunotherapy drug Tecentriq has lost market share to Merck & Co’s rival Keytruda since a clinical trial showed the Swiss company’s medicine failed to improve overall survival in bladder cancer. Many modern cancer drugs are approved on the basis of alternative clinical endpoints, such as tumor shrinkage or reduced risk of disease progression, but extending patients’ lives remains the most important benchmark for oncologists. Latest data show Tecentriq’s share of the bladder cancer market has slipped to 32 percent from around 45 percent before May’s surprise clinical trial failure, according to an analysis on Thursday by Barclays analysts. Tecentriq was given fast-track U.S. approval in 2016 based on positive preliminary bladder results - securing it a dominant position - but its overall survival miss contrasted with later success for Keytruda. Merck’s drug has seen its market share in bladder cancer rise to 16 percent since the Roche setback. Roche said in a statement that demonstrating an overall survival advantage remained the most clinically meaningful endpoint in cancer. “However, we believe that the totality of data and other key clinical endpoints should also be taken into consideration with regards to demonstrating a clinical benefit with cancer immunotherapy, such as duration of response, overall response rates and the safety profile, all of which also represent meaningful endpoints for patients and physicians,” it added. Approving promising new cancer drugs based on such alternative measures means they can get to patients faster, but the issue has sparked debate among medical experts. According to research published in the British Medical Journal on Thursday, the majority of new cancer drugs approved in recent years in Europe failed to show clear evidence that they improved patients’ survival or quality of life. The study by researchers from King’s College London and the London School of Economics and Political Science was based on an analysis of cancer drugs authorized by the European Medicines Agency (MEA) from 2009 to 2013. The study authors expressed concern at the finding. But Winette van der Graaf, professor of personalized oncology at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said she applauded the increased flexibility shown by the EMA. “If we want to speed up access for patients to the latest, most innovative new treatments, it’s essential that regulatory bodies... are willing to look at data other than just overall survival,” she said.

The treatment is part of a class known as CETP inhibitors designed to raise HDL, the so-called good cholesterol.      On Wednesday, the company said it will not submit an application for marketing approval after reviewing the clinical profile of the drug.

1251,MRK,Merck cyber attack may cost insurers $275 million: Verisk's PCS,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Insurers could pay $275 million to cover the insured portion of drugmaker Merck & Co’s loss from a cyber attack in June, according to a forecast by Verisk Analytics Inc’s Property Claim Services (PCS) unit. Merck, however, has not disclosed the magnitude of its uninsured losses from the “NotPetya” attack, which disrupted production of some Merck medicines and vaccines.  The company was among dozens of firms worldwide hit in the June 27 attack, which began in Ukraine, then rapidly spread through corporate networks of multinationals with operations or suppliers in Eastern Europe. “Merck has not yet fully quantified its losses, much less given any of its insurers an estimate of the total amount of those losses,” Merck spokeswoman Claire Gillespie said in a statement. She reiterated that Merck has insurance that would cover some costs, but declined to elaborate or say how much Merck expects to have to pay on its own. The drugmaker said in July that it had suffered a worldwide disruption of its operations as a result of the malware. It was still in the process of restoring its manufacturing operations a month later. Merck said then that it was confident it would be able to maintain a continuous supply of its top-selling and life-saving drugs, but warned of temporary delays in delivering some other products. NotPetya is a destructive virus that spread quickly across computer networks, crippling computers by encrypting hard drives so that machines cannot run. The attacks caused massive disruptions to industrial networks that rely on computers because businesses must individually replace damaged drives, a labor-intensive process. Cyber insurance can be expensive to buy and is not widely used outside the United States, with one insurer previously describing the cost as $100,000 for $10 million in data breach insurance.   Policies typically cover expenses stemming from a data breach, such as forensics and data restoration, among other costs. Coverage also helps pay for business interruption expenses when a breach or malware attack shuts down a company’s website. Some companies without cyber insurance have used their policies covering kidnap, ransom and extortion to recoup losses caused by ransomware viruses. PCS provides estimates on a wide variety of insured losses, ranging from damages caused by hacks to hurricanes and wildfires.

1258,MRK,U.S. committee recommends GSK shingles vaccine over Merck rival,"LONDON (Reuters) - The committee responsible for U.S. vaccination schedules has given a preferential recommendation to GlaxoSmithKline’s newly approved shingles vaccine Shingrix over Merck & Co’s established product Zostavax. The endorsement, by a 8-7 vote, promises to boost Shingrix sales and confirm its potential as a product with multibillion-dollar sales potential.  The backing from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) follows evidence from clinical trials that Shingrix is significantly more effective than Zostavax, the only currently available shingles prevention vaccine. ACIP members also recommended that Shingrix should be given routinely to Americans aged over 50 years, compared with 60 years for Zostavax, and they supported revaccination of people who previously received Zostavax.

1259,MRK,UPDATE 1-U.S. committee recommends GSK shingles vaccine over Merck rival,"LONDON (Reuters) - The committee responsible for U.S. vaccination schedules has given a preferential recommendation to GlaxoSmithKline’s newly approved shingles vaccine Shingrix over Merck & Co’s established product Zostavax. The endorsement, by a 8-7 vote, promises to boost Shingrix sales and confirm its potential as a product with multibillion-dollar sales potential.  The backing from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) follows evidence from clinical trials that Shingrix is significantly more effective than Zostavax, the only currently available shingles prevention vaccine. ACIP members also recommended that Shingrix should be given routinely to Americans aged over 50 years, compared with 60 years for Zostavax, and they supported revaccination of people who previously received Zostavax.

1262,MRK,"UPDATE 1-Bristol-Myers sales in line, but profit margins worsen","(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) reported a 7 percent increase in third-quarter revenue as sales of key drugs met Wall Street expectations, but earnings fell short due to higher costs and an inventory write-off, sending shares down 4 percent. Sales of cancer immunotherapy Opdivo rose 39 percent to $1.27 billion, in line with the average estimate of $1.21 billion, while sales of blood thinner Eliquis rose 38 percent to $1.23 billion, matching analyst estimates. The company said it expects to have final data in the first half of next year from a key trial of Opdivo as a treatment for newly-diagnosed lung cancer patients. Bristol has faced pressure from investors after losing ground to rival Merck & Co’s (MRK.N) cancer immunotherapy Keytruda. Excluding one-time items, the drugmaker said it earned 75 cents a share in the third quarter, compared with the 77 cents a share average analyst estimate, as compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “The bottom-line miss was due primarily to lower gross margin, resulting from changes in product mix and inventory,” Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a research note. Bristol said its gross margin as a percentage of revenue fell to 70.1 percent from 73.5 percent a year earlier due to product mix and higher costs, including a $70 million write-off of inventory for hepatitis C products. Stronger sales of Eliquis hurt the company’s overall profit margin, since the blood thinner is co-marketed with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N). Research and development costs for the quarter rose 36 percent to $1.5 billion, while the company’s effective tax rate increased to 27.6 percent from 22.1 percent in part due to the hurricane in Puerto Rico, where Bristol operates two manufacturing plants. Looking ahead, Bristol raised its full-year outlook for adjusted earnings per share by 5 cents to between $2.90 and $3.00. But the drugmaker lowered its net EPS outlook to a range of $2.36 to $2.46 from $2.66 to $2.76, citing higher research and development costs and taxes. Overall third-quarter revenue rose 7 percent to $5.25 billion, meeting Wall Street estimates.  Net earnings rose to $845 million, or 51 cents a share, from $384 million, or 24 cents a share, a year earlier. Shares of Bristol were down $2.62, or 4 percent, at $61.38 on the New York Stock Exchange.

1263,MRK,"Merck Keytruda sales soar, but European application pulled","(Reuters) - Merck & Co (MRK.N) on Friday said quarterly sales of its Keytruda cancer immunotherapy exceeded $1 billion for the first time, but it withdrew an application for European use of the drug in lung cancer, raising questions about future sales. Merck’s shares, which fell 6 percent to close at $58.24, were down another 3 percent at $56.68 after hours. Despite a near tripling in Keytruda sales to $1.05 billion, Merck said that the cost of a June cyber attack that temporarily crippled manufacturing coupled with lower sales of off-patent products caused its third-quarter revenue to fall 2 percent to $10.33 billion. The drugmaker said nearly one in three new lung cancer patients in the United States were starting with Keytruda and that the launch in bladder cancer was going well. Lung cancer is by far the most lucrative oncology market. Despite approvals for numerous cancer types, “Keytruda is almost completely reliant on the performance in first-line lung cancer,” said Leerink Partners analyst Seamus Fernandez. Late Friday Merck said it had withdrawn a European application for use of Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy as an initial treatment for nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common form of the disease. European approval had been expected next year, according to Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to that combination May, making Keytruda the first, and so far only, immunotherapy approved for first-line lung cancer. Merck earlier on Friday said a decision to make overall survival a main goal for a large, pivotal lung cancer trial of Keytruda plus chemotherapy would delay those results until February 2019. Merck spokeswoman Pam Eisele said no decisions have been made about when the European application would be resubmitted, but there would be opportunities for the company to conduct interim analyses of trial data. Merck said quarterly sales were cut by about $240 million as it had to borrow from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s stockpile doses of its Gardasil vaccine to prevent cancer caused by the human papillomavirus. Revenue fell by about $135 million from lost sales and there was another $175 million in costs related to the NotPetya cyber attack. The company expects a similar impact in the fourth quarter. Merck’s Zostavax shingles prevention vaccine is also about to face potentially withering competition from GlaxoSmithKline’s (GSK.L) just-approved Shingrix, which appears to maintain efficacy far longer. Zostavax sales rose 23 percent to $234 million. Merck cautioned that its Januvia diabetes drug would face continued pricing pressure. It along with the related Janumet saw sales fall 2 percent to $1.52 billion. The company’s recently off-patent cholesterol medicines Zetia and Vytorin saw sales cut in half at $462 million.  “They need to identify other growth drivers for the business,” said Fernandez, noting other areas under pressure, such at intense competition for the hepatitis C franchise. Chief Executive Ken Frazier said business development was an important priority, but that he would prefer bolt-on deals to enhance innovation rather than a major acquisition. Merck’s animal health business reached $1 billion in quarterly sales for the first time. “We see animal health as a pillar of growth for the company,” Frazier said. Merck now expects full-year adjusted earnings of $3.91 to $3.97 per share, above Wall Street estimates of $3.87, according to Thomson Reuters data. It previously forecast earnings of $3.76 to $3.88. Due to a $2.35 billion charge related to its collaboration with AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L), Merck posted a third-quarter net loss of $56 million. Excluding items, the company earned $1.11 per share, beating analysts’ average estimates by 8 cents, with help from cost controls.

Market watchers pointed to declines steepening after a Bloomberg report that the House of Representatives was discussing a gradual cut in corporate tax rates over several years. “A lot of people are looking to that corporate tax cut as a reason for the next leg up in stocks,” said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. Investors were also digesting the impact to Trump’s agenda from news that his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was charged with money laundering in the federal probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. “We are in a market that has just been on an absolute low-volatility, steady climb for quite a while, so you don’t need much of a reason for it to take a periodic step back, particularly a small step back,” Meckler said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 85.45 points, or 0.36 percent, to 23,348.74, the S&P; 500 .SPX lost 8.24 points, or 0.32 percent, to 2,572.83 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 2.30 points, or 0.03 percent, to 6,698.96. Stocks pared losses late in the day amid signs that Trump was close to picking Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell as head of the U.S. central bank. The New York Times reported Trump was “expected to” name Powell as soon as Thursday to replace Janet Yellen as Fed chair, after Reuters reported earlier that Trump was likely to pick him. The tech-heavy Nasdaq touched an intraday record high earlier in the session before pulling back. The S&P; tech sector .SPLRCT rose 0.4 pct, following big gains on Friday in the wake of a strong batch of earnings. Apple (AAPL.O) shares gained 2.3 percent after analysts pointed to strong demand for the iPhone X. Merck shares fell 6.1 percent after a setback to its key cancer medicine. The stock was among the top drags on the S&P; 500 and Dow industrials. In other corporate news, the board of Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T) is having doubts about the merger it has been negotiating between its U.S. wireless subsidiary Sprint Corp (S.N) and T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O), due to fears of losing control of a combined entity, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Sprint (S.N) shares fell 9.3 percent and T-Mobile (TMUS.O) ended off 5.4 percent. Market watchers readied for another big week of corporate results. With more than half the S&P; 500 reported, third-quarter earnings are expected to have climbed 6.7 percent, up from an expectation of 5.9-percent growth at the start of October, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Late on Friday, Merck withdrew an application for European use of its flagship drug Keytruda as an initial, or first-line, treatment for advanced lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy, raising questions about future sales. The Keytruda/chemo combination is already approved in the United States based on initial promising data. But the company determined that a similar European first-line approval without more mature late-stage data was unlikely. Lung cancer is by far the most lucrative oncology market with first-line approval providing access to the most patients.     In the wake of the news, at least three analysts cut their ratings on Merck's stock, a component of the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI, while other analysts lowered their target prices for the stock. “We are downgrading MRK shares to Equal Weight from Overweight based on diminished upside potential from Keytruda, which is by far Merck’s biggest value driver,” Barclays analyst Geoff Meacham said in his downgrade note. Aside from the European withdrawal, Meacham and other analysts also cited delays for another Keytruda study, revealed on Friday morning. Merck said a decision to make overall survival a main goal for a large, pivotal lung cancer trial of Keytruda plus chemotherapy would delay those results until February 2019. Merck shares fell 5.6 percent to $54.95 on Monday, touching their lowest point since May 2016. The stock had dropped 6 percent on Friday following the company’s third-quarter results.

1275,MRK,Cancer-drug setback sends Merck shares down again,"NEW YORK, Oct 30 (Reuters) - A setback for Merck & Co’s key cancer drug sent the drugmaker’s stock swooning on Monday for a second straight session, putting the shares on track for their biggest two-day decline in more than eight years. Late on Friday, Merck withdrew an application for European use of its flagship drug Keytruda in lung cancer, raising questions about future sales. In the wake of the news, at least three analysts cut their ratings on Merck’s stock, a component of the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average, while other analysts lowered their target prices for the stock. “We are downgrading MRK shares to Equal Weight from Overweight based on diminished upside potential from Keytruda, which is by far Merck’s biggest value driver,” Barclays analyst Geoff Meacham said in his downgrade note. Aside from the European withdrawal, Meacham and other analysts also cited delays for another Keytruda study, revealed on Friday morning. Merck said a decision to make overall survival a main goal for a large, pivotal lung cancer trial of Keytruda plus chemotherapy would delay those results until February 2019. Merck shares fell 4.9 percent to $55.39 on Monday, touching their lowest point since May 2016. The stock had dropped 6 percent on Friday following the company’s third-quarter results. The drugmaker said that the cost of a June cyber attack that temporarily crippled manufacturing coupled with lower sales of off-patent products caused its third-quarter revenue to fall 2 percent to $10.33 billion, even as Keytruda sales topped $1 billion for the first time. The combined 10.5 percent two-day decline for Merck shares would be the biggest since February 2009. Merck’s setback boosted shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co , which sells a rival cancer therapy. Bristol-Myers shares were up 2.1 percent. Pharmaceutical stocks have endured a rocky month so far as earnings results have poured in. The NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical index is down 1.8 percent in October against a 2.4 percent rise for the overall S&P; 500. Pharmaceutical heavyweight Pfizer Inc is set to report results on Tuesday.

1287,MRK,"As Brexit looms, UK pitches new industry plan, wins support from Merck, Qiagen","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain pitched a new strategy for industry on Monday, pledging greater state intervention to tackle weak productivity and to help the world’s sixth largest economy cope with the upheaval of leaving the European Union. Prime Minister Theresa May flagged the plan in January, seven months after Britain voted to leave the EU, adopting a hands-on approach to business that had largely been abandoned by her predecessors from the time of Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s. The 131-page document aims to reposition Britain so it can profit from the technological revolution by increasing research and development investment, improving technical education and building better infrastructure. “At its heart it epitomises my belief in a strong and strategic state that intervenes decisively wherever it makes a difference,” Prime Minister Theresa May said in a forward to the strategy, entitled “Building a Britain fit for the future”. May revived the once unfashionable concept of industrial strategy shortly before she won the top job in the political turmoil that accompanied the shock Brexit vote of 2016. In an attempt to underscore the importance of the new strategy, Britain said it had secured major investments from global healthcare company MSD, known as Merck & Co in the United States, and German-based diagnostics company Qiagen . While the Financial Times estimated the value of the investments at more than 1 billion pounds, MSD said it was too early to give an investment figure and Qiagen also gave no number. Life sciences is one of four sectors being targeted by the government, which will also focus on construction, artificial intelligence and the automotive industry. “There is a pipeline of new announcements of investments over the weeks ahead that we now expect,” Business Minister Greg Clark said. MSD’s UK and Ireland managing director Louise Houson said the company was working in collaboration with the UK government to build on its “forward thinking and ambitious” strategy. Under pressure to soothe uncertainty over the impact of Britain’s March 2019 EU exit, May said the strategy heralded a new approach to how government and business could work together. The launch, however, was overshadowed by Prince Harry’s announcement that he is engaged to U.S. actress Meghan Markle. Clark said Britain has some of the world’s best universities and research institutions, as well as leading companies in sectors ranging from advanced manufacturing to financial services, life sciences and creative industries. But he said Britain’s poor productivity - the amount of output per worker over a given period -  was one of the weaknesses that it had to address. Employers say it is difficult to find workers with the skills they require and bottlenecks in infrastructure like roads and railways hinder business. Last week, budget forecasters cut the country’s growth estimates for the next five years, largely because of reduced projections for productivity, the Achilles’ heel of the economy for generations. Britain’s economy is expected to grow by 1.5 percent in 2018, weaker than 2.0 percent growth among the world’s advanced economies as a whole, according to forecasts by the International Monetary Fund. Rebecca Long-Bailey, a business spokeswoman for the opposition Labour Party, said the strategy was short on detail. “This is a White Paper made up of re-announced policies and old spending commitments, showing once again that this is a Government short on details and new ideas,” Long-Bailey said. “Nothing in the White Paper will help give businesses the certainty or incentives they need to invest in the face of the government’s catastrophic handling of Brexit.” MSD said it would open a state-of-the-art life sciences discovery research facility in London by 2020, focusing on early bioscience discovery and entrepreneurial innovation. MSD said it viewed Britain as a world-leader in science, although a spokeswoman said Brexit raised “some very real concerns” for the supply chain, drug regulation and the ability to attract talent to Britain. The U.S. drugmaker intends to create 150 new research roles in London and move around 800 existing UK jobs to the capital. Qiagen said its plans to develop a genomics and diagnostics campus in Manchester, northern England, had the potential to create 800 jobs. The vote of confidence in Britain’s life sciences sector was welcomed by the government after the news last week that the European Medicines Agency would move from London to Amsterdam when Britain leaves the EU in March 2019. Brexit remains by far the biggest concern for British companies and multinationals with operations in Britain. With only months to go before many businesses need to make decisions on future investment, they are eager for clarity on how Brexit will work. However, talks with the European Union have made slow progress, and the government has only been able to reiterate its plan to seek a transition deal as soon as possible.

1290,MRK,"UK launches plan for industry as Brexit looms, wins Merck investment","LONDON, Nov 27 (Reuters) - The British government launched a new strategy for industry on Monday, aiming to intervene in key sectors to tackle weak productivity and bolster businesses to counter any new problems caused by Brexit. Prime Minister Theresa May first flagged the plan in January, seven months after Britain voted to leave the European Union, adopting a hands-on approach to business that had largely been abandoned by her predecessors from the time of Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s. The government said on Monday that it had secured a major investment from global healthcare company MSD, known as Merck & Co in the United States, ahead of the publication of the strategy. Life sciences is one of four sectors being targeted by the government, which will also focus on construction, artificial intelligence and the automotive industry. Business Minister Greg Clark said Britain has some of the world’s best universities and research institutions, as well as leading companies in sectors ranging from advanced manufacturing to financial services, life sciences and creative industries. “But any serious strategy should address the weaknesses that stop us achieving our potential, as well as our strengths, and this Industrial Strategy does that,” he said. “Britain’s productivity performance has not been good enough and is holding back our earning power as a country.” Last week Britain’s budget forecasters cut the country’s growth estimates for the next five years, largely because of reduced projections for productivity, the Achilles’ heel of the economy since the financial crisis. Clark said the new industrial strategy would strengthen infrastructure and the business environment in an effort to improve productivity. MSD said it would open a state-of-the-art life sciences discovery research facility in London by 2020, focusing on early bioscience discovery and entrepreneurial innovation. “This new London location will enable us to build on our proud legacy of invention and be an important contributor to the vibrant and rapidly growing London life sciences community while providing access for more collaborations within the European life science ecosystem,” said Roger M. Perlmutter, president of MSD Research Laboratories. MSD intends to create 150 new research roles and is evaluating locations in the London area, it said.

1295,MRK,Merck raises stakes in lung cancer as rivals close in,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc, maker of the only immunotherapy approved for patients newly-diagnosed with the most common type of lung cancer, could solidify its lead by playing the long game, even as rivals edge closer.  Shares of Merck have fallen 10 percent since the drugmaker several weeks ago said it would make survival a main goal of a key lung cancer trial for immunotherapy Keytruda, extending the study by up to a year.  In the meantime, Roche Holding AG has shaken up Wall Street expectations for the $15-billion lung cancer market, showing its Tecentriq immunotherapy slows the spread of advanced lung cancer when combined with older treatments. Roche Chief Executive Severin Schwan said the Swiss company has “the potential to get into the lead in first-line lung cancer.”  Some Merck investors and medical experts are betting it will be worth the wait to prove that Keytruda can extend lives. Modifying the study - which previously measured cancer progression - moved completion to February 2019 from early 2018.  “Adding survival makes a lot of sense. The benefit of these drugs tend to come out over a longer period of time,” said Karim Suwwan, manager of Fidelity’s Select Pharmaceutical Portfolio. The fund ranked immunotherapy rivals Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb and AstraZeneca in its top 10 holdings as of September 30. Non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in Merck’s Phase 3 study are treated with Keytruda plus the chemotherapy drugs Alimta, sold by Eli Lilly & Co, and carboplatin, or with chemo alone. “The validity of the results will be stronger if there is a survival benefit,” said Dr Roy Herbst, chief of medical oncology at Yale Cancer Center, who has been involved in several immunotherapy trials.  An earlier trial in similar patients indicated that initial treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy improves survival, but it was too small to be definitive. Merck research chief Roger Perlmutter said making survival a primary goal of the larger study aims to confirm this outcome. Based on the smaller study, U.S. regulators in May approved the chemo plus Keytruda combination. Keytruda alone is also approved as an initial treatment for lung cancer patients whose tumors have high levels of PDL1, a protein targeted by the drug. In Roche’s Phase III study presented last week, patients getting Tecentriq plus the older drug Avastin and chemo drugs carboplatin and paclitaxel lived for an average of 8.3 months without their disease getting worse, only modestly better than the 6.8 months seen for those getting chemotherapy and Avastin. More than a quarter of patients given the four-drug combination suffered serious side effects. Sandra Horning, chief medical officer at Roche’s Genentech unit, said survival results are expected in the first quarter of 2018.  Bristol and AstraZeneca also expect to report data from key lung cancer immunotherapy combination trials early next year. Keytruda and Tecentriq, as well as Bristol’s Opdivo and Astra’s Imfinzi, are designed to unleash the body’s immune system to attack cancer cells, and have been approved for a variety of cancers.  Lung cancer is the biggest oncology market, with about 220,000 people in the United States due to be diagnosed this year and 155,000 seen dying from the disease often caused by smoking. Some industry experts expect Merck to release initial survival results as early as mid-2018. That could allow the company to expand use of the drug more quickly to patients without PDL1 in their tumors, and build a stronger case for European approval, said Tony Butler, managing director at equity research firm Guggenheim Securities. For Tony Scherrer, co-portfolio manager at Smead Capital Management, Merck is justified in taking a slower road. Smead owns shares of Merck, but not Bristol, Roche or AstraZeneca.     “Others tried to speed up and didn’t get past the FDA,” he said. “Merck is doing what Merck has done over a long history - get it done right.” Shares of Merck trade at 13.6 times 2018 earnings estimates, a discount to their five-year average of 15 times, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.      For 2023, Wall Street analysts forecast Keytruda sales of $11.6 billion, Opdivo sales of $7.7 billion and Tecentriq sales of $4.7 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Drugmakers, doctors and patients have hoped that new, less toxic immunotherapies could replace chemotherapy for many cancers, but that works for only a minority of patients. So drugmakers began combining the newer therapies with chemo, other older cancer drugs and experimental treatments.  Hundreds of these trials are underway. Some have disappointed, including a cocktail of Bristol’s Opdivo with another immunotherapy, Yervoy, in lung cancers. Chemo alone tends to help only 30 percent of advanced lung cancer patients. Researchers say that chemo could act as a catalyst, creating cellular debris that makes tumor cells more visible to the immune system. “Nobody knows what chemo backbones could be the most powerful, and data will win out here,” Daniel Chen, head of cancer immunotherapy at Roche, told investors in October.

1296,MRK,Merck's Keytruda fails pivotal gastric cancer trial,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc said on Thursday a key late-stage trial testing its blockbuster drug, Keytruda, failed to meet its main goal of extending lives of patients with a type of gastric cancer. The trial, which was testing the drug as a second-line treatment, also failed to prevent the cancer from progressing in patients whose tumors expressed the PD-LI protein, the company said. The U.S. regulator earlier this year approved Keytruda as a third-line treatment for gastric cancer patients, who showed no response to two or more prior lines of therapy. Gastric, or stomach cancer, is a slow-progressing disease and it is estimated that more than 10,000 people will die from it in 2017 in the United States. Merck said on Thursday that it would continue to test the blockbuster drug in two other late-stage gastric cancer studies. Keytruda belongs to a class of drugs called PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors that block a mechanism tumors use to evade detection from cancer-fighting cells. It is seen as a forerunner of precision medicine, where genetic biomarkers may determine the course of therapy rather than the type of cancer. The drug, which netted $1.05 billion in sales in the latest quarter, has been previously approved to treat at least five other types of cancer including lung and bladder.

1301,MRK,U.S. FDA approves new diabetes drug from Merck and Pfizer,"(Reuters) - A new drug developed by Merck & Co and Pfizer Inc won U.S. approval on Wednesday to treat type II diabetes, the Food and Drug Administration said, adding another competitor to a growing class of treatments. The oral drug, known generically as ertugliflozin, will be sold under the brand name Steglatro and compete with AstraZeneca Plc’s Farxiga, Johnson & Johnson’s Invokana and Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim’s Jardiance. All four drugs belong to a class known as SGLT2 inhibitors, which work by causing patients to expel excess glucose through urine. Merck and Pfizer won approval for Steglatro as a single therapy and in fixed-dose combinations with Merck’s diabetes drug Januvia or with metformin, an older generic treatment typically given to newly diagnosed patients. Those will carry the brand names Steglujan and Segluromet, respectively. The approvals and prescribing information were listed on the FDA and Merck websites. The companies, in an emailed statement, said they expect to make the medicines available in early 2018. Under the collaboration Merck, which already has a sizable diabetes sales force, will sell the drug in the United States.   As type II diabetes progresses, many patients need additional treatments to better control blood sugar levels. Januvia is the top-selling drug in a class known as DPP-4 inhibitors. The combination with ertugliflozin will compete with combination products from rivals, including Eli Lilly’s Glyxambi, which combines Jardiance with its DPP-4 treatment Tradjenta. Jardiance, in a large study, demonstrated its ability to significantly cut the risk of heart-related deaths and hospitalizations from heart failure, claims now included in its label. Invokana has demonstrated similar heart protective qualities in high risk patients. Analysts are forecasting eventual annual sales exceeding $1 billion for Steglatro, but Merck and Pfizer will likely need to show similar heart protections if their medicine is to be competitive. Results of AstraZeneca’s heart safety trial of Farxiga are expected in 2019. Diabetes, characterized by elevated blood sugar levels, affects roughly 30 million Americans, and can lead to severe damage to a range of organs in the body, including the eyes and kidneys and significantly increases the risk of heart attack and stroke.

A cocktail of immunotherapy Keytruda and two chemotherapy medicines helped lung cancer patients live longer and stopped the disease from advancing, early results from a study showed, Merck said. The results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting whose date and location were not announced. An earlier trial in similar patients indicated that initial treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy improves survival, but the trial was too small to be definitive.  The latest results cement Merck’s position as a front-runner in the race to develop drugs that can be used as the initial or first-line treatment for patients with a common type of lung cancer. Shares of Merck fell around 10 percent last year after the company said in October that it would make survival a main goal of the lung cancer trial and extended the study by up to a year. Tuesday’s gains bring its shares back in line with where they were trading before the delay.  The results “will allow for Merck to extend their leadership position in 1st line non-small cell lung cancer where they are already dominating in the 25-30 percent of patients” whose tumors have high levels of PDL1, a protein targeted by the drug, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said in a research note.

The oral treatment for Type II diabetes, which will be sold under the brand name Steglatro, belongs to a class of drugs known as SGLT2 inhibitors, which help patients expel excess glucose through urine.(bit.ly/2FjyqXs) In December, Merck and Pfizer won approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Steglatro as a single therapy and in fixed-dose combinations with Merck’s diabetes drug Januvia or with metformin, an older generic treatment typically given to newly diagnosed patients. Diabetes, characterized by elevated blood sugar levels, can severely damage organs, including eyes and kidneys, and significantly raises the risk of heart attack and stroke. As type II diabetes progresses, many patients need additional treatments to better control blood sugar levels.

1320,MRK,AstraZeneca is sued by Array BioPharma over cancer drug royalties,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Array BioPharma Inc on Thursday sued AstraZeneca AB, accusing the pharmaceutical company of refusing to pay required royalties for a cancer drug after entering into an $8.5 billion collaboration with Merck & Co. In a complaint filed in the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, Array is seeking at least $192 million from AstraZeneca for the alleged breach of a 2003 licensing agreement related to the drug, known as selumetinib. AstraZeneca did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to the complaint, selumetinib is a compound discovered by Boulder, Colorado-based Array that inhibits activity of an enzyme involved in cell growth and metabolism. Array said the 2003 agreement allowed AstraZeneca to use selumetinib in research to fight cancer, and provided for a 12-percent royalty on sums that AstraZeneca might receive from sub-licensees such as Merck. But according to the complaint, AstraZeneca said it intends to pay that royalty on what Array called an “absurdly small” fraction of an expected $1.6 billion upfront payment from Merck. The $192 million sought represents 12 percent of that payment. Both companies agreed to have disputes under the agreement decided by New York courts, the complaint said. Array’s revenue totaled $150.9 million in the year ended June 30, 2017, a regulatory filing shows. Last July, AstraZeneca agreed to collaborate with Merck to study cancer drug combinations using its drug Lynparza, which regulators have approved to treat ovarian cancer and which could have other uses when combined with immunotherapy.    Merck agreed to pay AstraZeneca up to $8.5 billion in exchange for half of future Lynparza sales. AstraZeneca has said it plans to report full-year results on Friday. The case is Array BioPharma Inc v AstraZeneca AB, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 650517/2018.

1321,MRK,"Merck profit beats on lower taxes, overcoming sales miss","(Reuters) - Lower taxes helped U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co (MRK.N) beat analysts’ estimate for fourth-quarter earnings on Friday, offsetting weaker-than-expected sales as some of its products face increasing competition.  The drugmaker’s shares fell 0.8 percent to $59.35 in early trading. Sales for its blockbuster Keytruda cancer immunotherapy were better than expected, but Merck was hurt by competition for its shingles vaccine Zostavax and hepatitis C drug Zepatier.  The company also said 2018 earnings would likely be better than analysts had previously forecast as its tax rate will stay low due to the U.S. tax overhaul passed in December.  Merck now expects its effective tax rate in 2018 to be 19 percent to 20 percent, dropping by up to another percentage point after that. Chief Financial Officer Robert Davis said that the new law - which cut the corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent - should lower its taxes by a couple of percentage points. The company’s effective tax rate was 19.1 percent last year, but that was helped by one-time foreign tax benefits. Its 2016 effective tax rate was around 22 percent. Merck has about $17 billion of cash available for repatriation, according to Davis.  The company said it plans to invest $12 billion in capital projects over the next five years, two-thirds of which will be in the United States, due in part to the new tax law. Merck’s sales rose 3.1 percent to $10.43 billion in the fourth quarter, but were slightly below the average analyst estimate of $10.49 billion.  Sales of Keytruda, which works by blocking a mechanism tumors use to evade detection from the immune system, nearly tripled to $1.30 billion in the fourth quarter. The strong sales numbers for Keytruda were driven by uptake in first-line non-small cell lung cancer, Guggenheim Securities analyst Tony Butler said in a client note.  Lung cancer is by far the most lucrative oncology market, and Merck last month assuaged concerns about Keytruda testing delays by announcing positive early results from a lung cancer trial. Merck’s net loss widened to $872 million, or 32 cents per share, from $594 million, or 22 cents per share, a year earlier.  It took a charge of $2.6 billion related to the new U.S. tax law in the quarter.  Excluding items, Merck earned 98 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of 94 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Merck forecast 2018 adjusted profit in the range of $4.08-$4.23 per share. Analysts on average were expecting $4.11 per share.

1326,MRK,Bristol-Myers' positive cancer data still lags Merck,"(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) on Monday provided some positive data on its immuno-oncology drugs for the most lucrative lung cancer market but it fell short of giving clarity on its ability to compete with a rival treatment from Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N)  Shares fell 2.6 percent to $61.86 in midday trading. Bristol-Myers, which also reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings, said it found a new way to identify cancer patients who are treatable by immunotherapy drugs.  It said non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients whose tumor cells had a high level tumor mutation burden (TMB) showed a highly statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival with a combination of its immuno-oncology drugs Opdivo and Yervoy versus chemotherapy. Companies had been classifying patients in terms of a tumor’s expression of a protein called PD-L1. Better diagnostic tests could improve predictions of whether cancer patients are likely to benefit from the costly treatments. Progression-free survival is a measure of how long a treatment can keep the disease from worsening. But analysts said they were waiting to see if it actually helps patients live longer, a standard that Merck’s Keytruda has demonstrated in combination with chemotherapy in newly diagnosed advanced lung cancer. “Overall survival is what matters,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said in a research note, noting that regulators favor that standard. “The survival benefit may not be that great, and perhaps not as good as Merck’s.” The company said it plans to release overall survival data for the Opdivo and Yervoy combination toward the end of the year or early next year. Bristol-Myers was a pioneer in immunotherapy, but Merck has nearly pulled even, primarily via Keytruda’s use in lung cancer. Sales of Keytruda were just shy of the $1.36 billion that BMS pulled in with Opdivo in the quarter. The company posted a fourth-quarter net loss of $2.33 billion compared with a year-ago profit of $894 million, due to a one-time $2.9 billion charge related to the new U.S. tax reform law. Excluding one-time items, Bristol-Myers said it earned 68 cents per share in the quarter, beating analysts’ average expectations by a penny, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales of blood thinner Eliquis, which the company shares with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), rose nearly 44 percent to match Opdivo’s sales of $1.36 billion.

In one of the largest single-drug collaboration deals ever, Nektar will receive $1 billion in cash upfront and Bristol-Myers will purchase about 8.28 million Nektar shares at $102.60 per share, or an equity stake of just under 5 percent of the company. Nektar shares closed at $75.66 on Tuesday. If all potential development, regulatory and sales milestones in the deal are met, it could be worth more than $3.6 billion to Nektar, while giving Bristol-Myers a new immunotherapy platform. Nektar shares were up 8 percent at $81.74, while Bristol-Myers shares rose 0.7 percent to $64.32. “We believe the deal economics are favorable to both parties,” Cowen analyst Chris Shibutani said in a research note. The partnership is built around the Nektar drug, NKTR-214, which will be tested with Bristol’s immuno-oncology (IO) drugs Opdivo and Opdivo and Yervoy in 20 cancer indications across nine different tumor types, including melanoma, kidney and lung cancers, following “very encouraging” early data from clinical trials. “We’ve been in a clinical collaboration with Nektar since 2016. This partnership was a natural next step,” Paul Biondi, head of business development for Bristol-Myers, said in a telephone interview. The combination therapies could become “potentially a new backbone in the IO space,” he added. The announcement comes as early immunotherapy leader Bristol-Myers has been viewed by investors as having fallen behind Merck & Co in the burgeoning field, especially in the most lucrative lung cancer space. NKTR-214, a CD122 agonist that utilizes the interleukin-2 (IL-2) pathway, is designed to increase the number and activation state of cancer-fighting T cells in the tumor microenvironment, while limiting IL-2 toxicity, with the hope of improving and lengthening patient responses. Nektar is also eligible to receive an additional $1.78 billion in milestone payments, of which $1.43 billion are development and regulatory milestones and the remainder are sales milestones. Following approvals, Nektar will book revenue for worldwide NKTR-214 sales and the companies will split global profits, with Nektar receiving 65 percent and Bristol-Myers 35 percent, they said. Bristol-Myers will retain 100 percent of revenues for its own medicines. The transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2018, the companies said. Both companies would be free to develop NKTR-214 with other drugs for uses not laid out in the deal.

1336,MRK,Gilead wins reversal of $2.54 billion hepatitis C drug patent verdict,"(Reuters) - A federal judge in Delaware has overturned a jury’s verdict requiring Gilead Sciences Inc to pay a record $2.54 billion because its hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni infringed a patent held by rival Merck & Co Inc. The verdict had been the largest ever in a U.S. patent case but U.S. District Judge Leonard Stark in Wilmington, Delaware, on Friday ruled Merck’s patent was invalid. He said it did not meet a requirement that it disclose how to make the treatment it covered without undue experimentation. Gilead in a statement on Saturday said it always believed the patent was invalid and was pleased the judge confirmed that opinion. Merck in a statement said it planned to appeal and believed the judge’s ruling did not reflect the facts of the case. The December 2016 verdict followed a trial in which jurors found that Merck’s patent on hepatitis C treatments, which it acquired in 2014 when it bought Idenix Pharmaceuticals, was valid. Hepatitis C, estimated to infect about 3.2 million Americans, is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver that can lead to liver failure.  Direct-acting antivirals, such as Gilead’s Sovaldi and Harvoni, have revolutionized treatment, with cure rates of more than 90 percent shown in clinical trials. But there was a backlash from health insurers and other payors when Gilead launched Sovaldi at a price of $84,000 for a 12-week course. Foster City, California-based Gilead reported that in 2017 it earned $9.1 billion on its four products to treat hepatitis C, including Harvoni and Sovaldi. Idenix, the original holder of the patent at issue in the lawsuit, sued Gilead in 2013 in an effort to block the launch of Sovaldi, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December of that year. Harvoni, which combines Sovaldi’s active ingredient, sofosbuvir, with another drug, was approved in October 2014. Merck sells its own hepatitis C drug, Zepatier. The company won a $200 million jury verdict last March in a separate patent infringement case against Gilead over hepatitis C drugs. But in June 2016, a federal judge in San Jose, California, overturned that verdict after finding that Merck engaged in a pattern of unethical conduct, including lying under oath. Merck has disputed the judge’s ruling and is appealing. The case is Idenix Pharmaceuticals LLC et al v. Gilead Sciences Inc, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware, No. 14-cv-00846.

1339,MRK,Merck to buy virus-based cancer drug firm Viralytics for $394 million,"(Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co (MRK.N), already one of the leaders in the hot area of cancer immunotherapy, said on Wednesday it had agreed to buy Viralytics (VLA.AX) for 502 million Australian dollars ($394 million) to expand its pipeline in the sector. Merck will pay 1.75 Australian dollars per share for the Sydney-based biotech company, which uses viruses to infect and kill cancer cells.  The idea is to cause cancer cells to rupture and die, while also stimulating a wider immune system response in the body. The deal, which is conditional on no better offer emerging from a counter-bidder, represents a premium of 160 percent to the average stock price over the past month - another example of the outsized offers often needed to clinch biotech takeovers. Viral immunotherapy represents a new way of treating cancer and a number of companies are working to harness the power of specific viruses to fight tumors. Amgen (AMGN.O) became the first company to win approval for such a treatment in 2015. Merck’s current research chief Roger Perlmutter was responsible for acquiring the Amgen product during his previous job as head of R&D; at the U.S. biotechnology giant. Viralytics’s leading experimental product, Cavatak, uses a proprietary formulation of a common cold virus and is currently being studied in multiple Phase I and Phase II clinical trials. Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat said the acquisition represented “a very nice tuck-in” for Merck and came at an interesting time since Viralytics is expected to have news on clinical tests of its oncolytic virus with Merck’s immunotherapy drug Keytruda in the second quarter of 2018. Trials testing Cavatak with Keytruda include experiments to treat melanoma, prostate, lung and bladder cancers. Roy Baynes, Merck’s head of global clinical development, said Viralytics’s approach complemented the U.S. drugmaker’s immuno-oncology strategy and opened up the possibility of new synergistic drug combinations.  The board of Viralytics said it unanimously recommended shareholders vote in favor of the Merck offer, “subject to there being no superior proposal and an independent expert concluding that the scheme is in the best interest of the company’s shareholders”. The deal comes at a time of booming merger and acquisition activity in the biotechnology sector, with $27.5 billion of transactions agreed in January alone as large drugmakers look for promising assets to improve their pipelines. On completion of the transaction - expected by the second quarter of 2018 - Viralytics will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Merck.

1348,MRK,"Eisai clinches Merck deal to develop and sell cancer drug, shares soar"," (This March 8 story has been corrected to show in the 7th paragraph that Merck will pay, not receive, R&D; reimbursement) By Bill Berkrot and Sam Nussey NEW YORK/TOKYO (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc and Japan’s Eisai Co Ltd have signed a potential multibillion-dollar collaboration to develop and sell Eisai’s cancer drug Lenvima, which is already approved in dozens of countries for two uses. The deal, under which Lenvima will be developed for several types of cancer alone and in combination with Merck’s immunotherapy Keytruda, could be worth up to $5.76 billion to Eisai, but most of that would be contingent on eventual sales. Eisai shares surged 10 percent on the news, with the Japanese drugmaker saying Lenvima may become a blockbuster drug generating annual sales of at least $1 billion in the year ending March 2021. U.S. drugmaker Merck will be entitled to half of all global Lenvima sales revenue, even for its already approved uses for thyroid cancer and in combination with another drug for kidney cancer. The deal is similar to a multibillion-dollar oncology collaboration Merck struck with AstraZeneca Plc on its cancer drug Lynparza and another medicine last July. “Like the Lynparza deal with AstraZeneca, this starts to really broaden out Merck’s portfolio,” Frank Clyburn, head of Merck’s commercial oncology business, said in an interview. “And Merck will start to receive revenue right away.” Under the deal, Eisai will receive an upfront payment of $300 million and up to $650 million for certain option rights through March 2021. Eisai could receive another $385 million in clinical and regulatory milestones, and Merck will pay another $450 million as reimbursement for research and development costs. The collaboration gives Eisai access to Merck’s R&D; and sales clout as well as a means of maximizing the potential of Lenvima in combination with the leading immunotherapy drug.  Following positive trial data showing that Lenvima with Keytruda led to tumor shrinkage in 63 percent of advanced kidney cancer patients, the combination received breakthrough designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The combination also appeared to enhance the impact of Keytruda on advanced kidney cancer.  Breakthrough status is a designation given to treatments demonstrating substantial improvement over existing therapies in treating a serious or life threatening illness. The companies said they will develop the combination for 11 different potential uses across six other cancer types, including skin cancer and bladder cancer. “It makes sense ... to try to develop the drug to the full extent possible as monotherapy and in combination with Keytruda,” Roger Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Laboratories, said in an interview. Lenvima, an oral drug known chemically as lenvatinib, was discovered by Eisai scientists and belongs to a class of medicines known as tyrosine kinase inhibitors that block the blood vessel supply to tumors and tumor growth. The injection of funds following the deal will be used to accelerate research and development of treatments for Alzheimer’s disease and cancer, Eisai Chief Executive Haruo Naito told a news conference in Tokyo. Eisai’s shares, currently worth some $17 billion, have been hit in recent months by setbacks for two Alzheimer’s drugs in development with Biogen Inc. One drug, BAN2401, failed to meet the main goal of a mid-stage trial, Biogen said in December.

1353,MRK,Massachusetts court: Merck can be sued over generic drug injury,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Massachusetts’ top court on Friday opened the door for consumers to sue Merck & Co Inc and other makers of brand-name drugs over injuries blamed not on their own medications but on generic versions of their treatments made by other companies. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that brand-name drugmakers can be sued for recklessness if they intentionally fail to update warning labels for their drugs that makers of cheaper, generic versions must adopt as well. The case was closely watched within the industry, and Merck drew support from industry groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Merck in a statement said it was disappointed and stands by the drug at issue, Proscar. The decision came in a lawsuit by Massachusetts resident Brian Rafferty, who said he suffered from side effects, including sexual dysfunction, after taking the generic version of Merck’s Proscar to treat an enlarged prostate beginning in 2010. Under a 2011 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, generic drug companies cannot be sued for failing to provide adequate label warnings about potential side effects because federal law requires them to use the brand-name versions’ labels. As a result, Rafferty instead sued Merck, saying its Provacar label failed to warn that such side effects could continue after discontinuing use of the drug. A lower-court judge dismissed his negligence claims. The top court reversed, allowing Rafferty to sue Merck for recklessness rather than negligence. This requires a higher standard of proof showing a drugmaker intentionally failed to update its warning label despite knowing the risks. “Where a brand-name drug manufacturer provides an inadequate warning for its own product, it knows or should know that it puts at risk not only the users of its own product, but also the users of the generic product,” Chief Justice Ralph Gants wrote. Shielding brand-name manufacturers from liability entirely would leave consumers with no chance to sue generic drug companies, whose products command about 90 percent of the market, Gants wrote for the 4-0 court.

The California Supreme Court in December ruled brand-name manufacturers could be sued by generic drug users.

1354,MRK,Massachusetts court: Merck can be sued over generic drug injury,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Massachusetts’ top court on Friday opened the door for consumers to sue Merck & Co Inc and other makers of brand-name drugs over injuries blamed not on their own medications but on generic versions of their treatments made by other companies. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that brand-name drugmakers can be sued for recklessness if they intentionally fail to update warning labels for their drugs that makers of cheaper, generic versions must adopt as well. The case was closely watched within the industry, and Merck drew support from industry groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Merck in a statement said it was disappointed and stands by the drug at issue, Proscar. The decision came in a lawsuit by Massachusetts resident Brian Rafferty, who said he suffered from side effects, including sexual dysfunction, after taking the generic version of Merck’s Proscar to treat an enlarged prostate beginning in 2010. Under a 2011 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, generic drug companies cannot be sued for failing to provide adequate label warnings about potential side effects because federal law requires them to use the brand-name versions’ labels. As a result, Rafferty instead sued Merck, saying its Provacar label failed to warn that such side effects could continue after discontinuing use of the drug.

1356,MRK,Roche's Tecentriq cocktail adds to lung cancer survival success,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Roche’s Tecentriq immunotherapy combined with other drugs boosted lung cancer patients’ survival versus an older cocktail, the Swiss company said as it seeks an edge on Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb. Mixing Tecentriq with Avastin and carboplatin and paclitaxel boosted overall survival in first-line treatment of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, Roche said on Monday, compared to patients who received only Avastin plus the two chemotherapies. The latest trial success follows Roche’s announcement last week about a separate study in which Tecentriq mixed with chemotherapies carboplatin and Abraxane boosted progression-free survival, compared with chemotherapy alone, in first-line treatment of patients with advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer.  The Basel-based company, which had previously announced Tecentriq, Avastin and chemotherapy had reduced the risk of disease progression or death, said on Monday it hopes for a quick approval from authorities for the cocktail. While Roche did not provide specific overall survival data, the headline result helps its bid to catch up to better-established immunotherapies from Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb and its shares rose about 1 percent in early trading.  “We are pleased the IMpower150 study demonstrated a clinically meaningful survival benefit for people receiving their initial treatment for this type of advanced lung cancer,” said Sandra Horning, Roche’s chief medical officer.  She also said the survival benefit was observed across key subgroups, including those with varying levels of a protein called PD-L1 that can help tumors avoid detection. This could help Roche make the case that its cocktail is suitable for broad patients groups, not just those with specific biomarkers. The world’s biggest maker of cancer drugs is counting on growing sales of Tecentriq, which notched 487 million Swiss francs in 2017, to help offset falling revenue from its older cancer medicines Avastin, Rituxan and Herceptin whose patent expirations are exposing them to rivals’ cheaper copies. Analysts from Baader Helvea said its announcement completes an “already robust” set of data for regulators who now must sign off on Tecentriq’s use as an initial treatment of lung cancer. “We continue to see Roche efficacy more than sufficiently competitive to grant a 43 percent market share in the indication, translating in 4.9 billion francs Tecentriq peak sales and 1.2 billion francs in 2018,” Baader’s Bruno Bulic said.  “Facing biosimilar competition... we see Tecentriq sales coming timely to support Roche’s profitability going forward.”   ",3262018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-roche-tecentriq/roches-tecentriq-cocktail-adds-to-lung-cancer-survival-success-idUSKBN1H20FP

1368,MRK,Merck's Keytruda helps lung cancer patients live longer in trial,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co’s (MRK.N) blockbuster drug Keytruda helped previously untreated lung cancer patients live longer in a late-stage trial, potentially cementing its position as the dominant player in the lucrative lung cancer market. Shares of the drugmaker were up 3.1 percent at $55.07. Merck is already considered the frontrunner in the space and Keytruda is expected to earn peak sales of over $10 billion in 2023, according to Credit Suisse. Keytruda is already approved in the U.S. to treat patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not received prior therapies and whose tumors show PD-L1 protein levels of 50 percent or greater. If the company can show that the new data benefits patients whose PD-L1 expression is between 1 and 49 percent, it would expand Keytruda’s market and raise the competitive benchmark for rivals Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) and AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L), BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said. An independent data monitoring committee determined the trial, which tested Keytruda as a monotherapy to treat NSCLC, extended the lives of patients significantly compared to chemotherapy. Additional data from Merck, as well as results from trials of competitors, could eventually determine which companies will snatch the largest slice of the pie for the lung cancer market. “I think the market still believes that there could be other players in the lung cancer market, which would combat overall sales of Keytruda in this setting,” Guggenheim Securities analyst Tony Butler told Reuters.  “Because we don’t know the full data set we don’t know the survival benefit here.” Based on a recommendation from the committee, the trial will continue to evaluate a secondary goal on whether the treatment can delay the disease from progressing. “While it is still unclear whether Keytruda and (Bristol-Myers’) Opdivo are truly different in some way, it is crystal clear that Merck has done a much better job designing trials and developing their drug. This will solidify their lead,” said Brad Loncar, chief executive officer of Loncar Investments, which runs the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF.   Keytruda, which is approved to treat several other forms of cancer including skin and blood cancer, racked up $3.81 billion in revenue in 2017.  Lung cancer is the second most common cancer and is expected to kill over 154,000 people this year, the American Cancer Society says.

1371,MRK,Survival data boosts Merck's Keytruda lead in lung cancer,"NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Merck & Co’s immunotherapy Keytruda plus chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival in newly-diagnosed patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer in a closely-watched study, cementing its lead position over Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and others in the most lucrative oncology market. The survival data sent Merck shares up 2.2 percent to $58.47, while shares of Bristol-Myers plunged 8.4 percent to $53.68 despite positive lung cancer data for its immunotherapy combination in a subset of patients with a high degree of tumor mutations. The magnitude of the survival benefit in the late-stage study was not yet known, but Keytruda plus chemotherapy cut the risk of death by 51 percent compared with chemotherapy alone, according to data presented at the American Association of Cancer Research meeting in Chicago on Monday. “The Merck data is pretty much a home run,” said Dr. Roy Herbst, chief of medical oncology at Yale Cancer Center, who was not involved in the study. “The whole idea (of immunotherapy) would be to avoid chemotherapy. But it works. It’s amazing that we’re going to be bringing these drugs to the majority of patients with lung cancer in the first-line setting,” Herbst added. “Why would you wait and not give someone immunotherapy up front?”  Bristol-Myers’s combination therapy significantly stalled disease progression versus standard chemotherapy in newly-diagnosed advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for patients with a high tumor mutational burden (TMB), a potentially important new biomarker for identifying those most likely to benefit from immunotherapy. But overall survival is considered the gold standard by doctors and investors, giving Keytruda a clear leg up. The Keytruda plus chemotherapy regimen was approved as an initial, or first-line, treatment for advanced NSCLC patients based on earlier data from a small study. But many clinicians wanted to see validation of a survival benefit in a large trial. “We were all waiting to see a definitive Phase III study that showed very clear cut results,” said Dr. Leena Gandhi, the study’s primary investigator and director of thoracic medical oncology at NYU Langone in New York. Keytruda and Opdivo have piled up approvals for advanced cancers, such as for melanoma and bladder cancer. But those drugs and rival immunotherapies from Roche and AstraZeneca are jockeying for pieces of the largest lung cancer market, especially the coveted newly-diagnosed setting.  There are more than 200,000 new cases of NSCLC each year in the United States alone, with about half at advanced stage at the time of initial diagnosis. In the Merck-sponsored trial of more than 600 patients called Keynote-189, median overall survival was 11.3 months for chemotherapy, about what was expected. After 12 months, 69.2 percent of patients in the Keytruda group were alive compared with 49.4 percent for chemotherapy, researchers reported. “We don’t know how long their survival is going to be and we’re excited about that,” said Gandhi. The differences would likely have been more pronounced, but many patients in the chemotherapy group were given Keytruda or a similar drug once their disease progressed. Keytruda, with a list price of about $13,500 a month before discounts or rebates, was given every three weeks with a standard chemotherapy regimen. It can be given for up to 24 months for those without disease progression, Merck said. Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical and scientific officer for the American Cancer Society, called both trials “incredibly important studies.” “I worry about cost. A lot of people won’t be able to afford these drugs,” Brawley said. There was a small increase in acute kidney injury in the Keytruda group compared with chemotherapy alone. There were also three treatment-related deaths from pneumonitis among Keytruda patients.    In the study called CheckMate-227, 43 percent of patients with high TMB who received Opdivo and low-dose Yervoy experienced no disease progression after one year versus 13 percent in the chemotherapy group. There was preliminary evidence of a likely survival benefit but it was too early to determine that, researchers said.  The overall response rate - those with significant tumor shrinkage - was 45 percent for the immunotherapies versus 27 percent for chemotherapy. Dr. Matthew Hellman of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, who led the study, and others said it was a validation of the TMB biomarker. “Maybe we can look at the TMB and it can further personalize therapy,” said Herbst. In both studies, positive results were not dependent on cancer cell’s levels of PD-L1, a marker of inflammation that has been commonly used with drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo to help predict patient responses, with higher PD-L1 levels believed to lead to greater efficacy. “This is great that there’s new options and improved outcomes” for patients with lung cancer, Hellman said.

1372,MRK,UPDATE 2-Survival data boosts Merck's Keytruda lead in lung cancer,"NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Merck & Co’s immunotherapy Keytruda plus chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival in newly-diagnosed patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer in a closely-watched study, cementing its lead position over Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and others in the most lucrative oncology market. The survival data sent Merck shares up 2.2 percent to $58.47, while shares of Bristol-Myers plunged 8.4 percent to $53.68 despite positive lung cancer data for its immunotherapy combination in a subset of patients with a high degree of tumor mutations. The magnitude of the survival benefit in the late-stage study was not yet known, but Keytruda plus chemotherapy cut the risk of death by 51 percent compared with chemotherapy alone, according to data presented at the American Association of Cancer Research meeting in Chicago on Monday. “The Merck data is pretty much a home run,” said Dr. Roy Herbst, chief of medical oncology at Yale Cancer Center, who was not involved in the study. “The whole idea (of immunotherapy) would be to avoid chemotherapy. But it works. It’s amazing that we’re going to be bringing these drugs to the majority of patients with lung cancer in the first-line setting,” Herbst added. “Why would you wait and not give someone immunotherapy up front?”  Bristol-Myers’s combination therapy significantly stalled disease progression versus standard chemotherapy in newly-diagnosed advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for patients with a high tumor mutational burden (TMB), a potentially important new biomarker for identifying those most likely to benefit from immunotherapy. But overall survival is considered the gold standard by doctors and investors, giving Keytruda a clear leg up. The Keytruda plus chemotherapy regimen was approved as an initial, or first-line, treatment for advanced NSCLC patients based on earlier data from a small study.

The settlement between the two biotech companies resolves a lawsuit that Alnylam filed against Dicerna in 2015. The accord came ahead of a jury trial that was set to begin on Monday in state court in Woburn, Massachusetts. Under the agreement, Dicerna said it will pay Alnylam $2 million up-front plus 983,208 shares of its common stock. Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Dicerna said it will also pay Alnylam another $13 million over the next four years, the timing of which is dependent on revenue Dicerna receives pursuant to future RNAi technology-based partnerships under its GalXC brand. Alnylam, also Cambridge-based, in a statement said the deal would also place certain restrictions on Dicerna. Neither company admitted wrongdoing. Dicerna’s stock was trading at $13.20 midday on Friday, up 29.12 percent. Shares in Alnylam were trading at $97.59, up 1.46 percent. Alnylam’s lawsuit accused Dicerna of misappropriating confidential information related to RNAi technology Alnylam acquired when in 2014 when it bought a Merck & Co Inc subsidiary in a deal it valued in court papers at $325 million. RNAi, or RNA interference, prevents a defective gene from making disease-causing proteins. The lawsuit said Dicerna, which unsuccessfully tried to acquire RNAi assets from Merck, used confidential information it reviewed while considering the potential transaction in violation of a confidentiality agreement. Alnylam contended Dicerna also hired several Merck scientists who had been involved in developing the technologies its rival acquired as part of an intentional scheme to gain access to trade secrets and confidential information. Alnylam in court papers filed in Middlesex County Superior Court said the scheme allowed Dicerna to develop “strikingly similar” technologies within a year and unjustly enriched the company by up to $325 million. Dicerna denied the allegations. It filed a counterclaim alleging Alnylam was pursuing a frivolous lawsuit that improperly interfered with its funding sources and partnership opportunities in order to crush its smaller competitor. Dicerna sought $42.2 million in damages. It also filed a related federal antitrust case against Alnylam, which is also being settled.

The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes hit a four-year high of 2.998 percent, edging closer to the 3-percent level, amid worries about the growing supply of government debt and accelerating inflation as oil and commodity prices climb. Rising bond yields usually tend to make stocks less attractive in comparison. But market strategists said a strong earnings season could help investors overlook such concerns. “If we get to that level (3 percent on the 10-year yields), it’s not going to be too much of a negative for investors because earnings have been coming in quite good,” said Jeff Kravetz, regional investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. Kravetz said bonds won’t be a competition for stocks until the 10-year Treasury yield hits 4 percent. With first-quarter results pouring in, profits are already turning out to be much stronger-than-expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Earnings at S&P; 500 companies are now estimated to have risen 19.9 percent in the quarter, compared with a forecast of 18.6 at the start of the season, which would have marked the biggest growth in seven years. This week, 181 S&P; 500 companies are scheduled to report including some of the technology heavy-hitters like Facebook , Microsoft, Amazon and Intel. Alphabet reports after markets close on Monday. “We’ve got great consumer sentiment and inflation is still contained. But as rates go up, and we do get risk up in the system,” Kravetz said. At 13:54 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 6.89 points, or 0.03 percent, at 24,469.83, the S&P; 500 was up 3.59 points, or 0.13 percent, at 2,673.73 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.42 points, or 0.02 percent, at 7,144.71. Five of the 11 major S&P; sectors were higher, with the biggest boost coming from a rise of about 0.4 percent in both the healthcare and consumer discretionary indexes. Merck rose 3 percent on a Goldman Sachs upgrade to “buy”, while fellow Dow component Caterpillar gained 0.7 percent after Citigroup raised the rating to “buy”. Among other healthcare gainers was Henry Schein, which rose 6.7 percent after the dental equipment maker said it would spin off its animal health unit. Shares of aluminum companies fell after the U.S. opened the door to sanctions relief for Russian aluminum giant United Company Rusal Plc. Alcoa tumbled 14 percent and Arconic’s 4.7 percent drop made it the biggest loser on the S&P.; Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.16-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.29-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P; index recorded six new 52-week highs and 13 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 63 new highs and 58 new lows.

1380,MRK,U.S. court upholds dismissal of $200 million Merck verdict against Gilead,"(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday affirmed a ruling that pharmaceutical company Merck & Co dishonestly obtained patent rights and was not entitled to collect a $200 million infringement verdict it won against rival Gilead Sciences Inc. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a June 2016 ruling that the two Merck patents, which cover methods of treating Hepatitis C, were unenforceable because of a pattern of misconduct by the company, including lying under oath by one of its in-house lawyers.  A Gilead spokesman said the company was very pleased with the ruling and believe it was “justified and well supported by the record.”  A Merck spokeswoman said in a statement that the ruling “does not reflect the facts of the case” and that the company was reviewing its next steps. Direct-acting anti-virals, such as Gilead’s Sovaldi and Harvoni, have revolutionized treatment of Hepatitis C, with cure rates of more than 90 percent. The viral disease is estimated to infect about 3.2 million Americans and can lead to liver failure. A jury in federal court in San Jose, California, awarded Merck $200 million in 2016 after finding Sovaldi and Harvoni infringed two of its patents. A judge threw out the verdict later that year, ruling the patents were unenforceable based on the company’s conduct. She noted that, in the process of applying for one of the patents, Merck used confidential information it obtained in 2004 while discussing a possible partnership with Pharmasset Inc, a company Gilead bought in 2011.  The judge also said a Merck in-house lawyer testified untruthfully in a deposition and at trial about his participation in a confidential call with Pharmasset personnel. Merck appealed the ruling, saying there was no “deliberately planned and carefully executed scheme by Merck to defraud or deceive.” But the appeals court said in Wednesday’s ruling that the lower judge had sufficient reason to conclude that the Merck patents were “tainted” by misconduct and should not be enforceable. In February a federal judge in Delaware overturned a different jury verdict requiring Gilead to pay $2.54 billion for infringing another Merck patent relating to the hepatitis C drugs. The verdict had been the largest ever in a U.S. patent case, but the judge ruled Merck’s patent was invalid because it did not meet a requirement that it disclose how to make the treatment it covered without undue experimentation.

1384,MRK,Keytruda sales power Merck to quarterly beat,"(Reuters) - Drugmaker Merck & Co (MRK.N) reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, helped by a more than 150 percent rise in sales of blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda. Shares dropped 2.8 percent to $57.22, however, on investor concerns that the company is becoming increasingly reliant on the drug, which is positioned to become the leading player in a new generation of oncology treatments.  Analysts said some investors were disappointed that the company said it does not plan to spin off its animal health business or do a large, transformational deal. “While Keytruda continues to do fantastically well, investors are still clamoring for something else besides Keytruda to focus on – thus the push by investors to spin out animal health, and the continual probing about M&A;,” Jefferies analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note. The surge in Keytruda sales more than offset steep declines in sales for its shingles vaccine Zostavax and hepatitis C treatment Zepatier.  Keytruda had sales of $1.46 billion in the quarter, ahead of $1.40 billion estimated by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Keytruda’s sales have nearly pulled even with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY.N) rival drug Opdivo, which also harnesses the body’s immune system to recognize and fight cancer cells. Industry experts give Merck’s drug the edge after results from trials for both treatments last month, and Merck said on Tuesday the drug could be its largest seller ever. Revenue from the drug accounted for nearly 15 percent of Merck’s sales. Merck CEO Ken Frazier said on the company’s conference call that while the company did not expect to do transformational deals, it was looking for opportunities to enhance its drug pipeline. “We have a strong balance sheet. We have the power and the flexibility to do deals at any size and stage, and we’re going to continue to look for things that can drive long-term value and growth,” he said.  Merck raised its full-year forecast for adjusted earnings to $4.16 to $4.28 per share from its previous forecast of $4.08 to $4.23 per share. Net income fell 52.5 percent to $736 million, or 27 cents per share, hurt by a $1.4-billion charge related to a collaboration with Eisai Co Ltd, the company said. Excluding items, Merck earned $1.05 per share, ahead of analysts’ estimates of $1 per share. Revenue rose 6.4 percent to $10.04 billion but missed estimates of $10.11 billion.

1385,MRK,UPDATE 3-Keytruda sales power Merck to quarterly beat,"(Reuters) - Drugmaker Merck & Co (MRK.N) reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, helped by a more than 150 percent rise in sales of blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda. Shares dropped 2.8 percent to $57.22, however, on investor concerns that the company is becoming increasingly reliant on the drug, which is positioned to become the leading player in a new generation of oncology treatments.  Analysts said some investors were disappointed that the company said it does not plan to spin off its animal health business or do a large, transformational deal. “While Keytruda continues to do fantastically well, investors are still clamoring for something else besides Keytruda to focus on – thus the push by investors to spin out animal health, and the continual probing about M&A;,” Jefferies analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note. The surge in Keytruda sales more than offset steep declines in sales for its shingles vaccine Zostavax and hepatitis C treatment Zepatier.  Keytruda had sales of $1.46 billion in the quarter, ahead of $1.40 billion estimated by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

1390,MRK,UPDATE 1-Merck KGaA family says unreservedly behind the pharma unit,"DARMSTADT, Germany (Reuters) - The family behind Germany’s Merck KGaA said it was fully committed to the diversified group’s pharmaceuticals unit, even if cancer immunotherapy hopeful avelumab does not achieve blockbuster sales. “Pharma is one of our three pillars and we absolutely stand behind it. If avelumab doesn’t become a blockbuster there are enough highly interesting products in our pipeline,” said family representative Frank Stangenberg-Haverkamp, speaking at an event marking the group’s 350-year anniversary at its Darmstadt, Germany headquarters. Blockbuster is the industry term for a drug with more than $1 billion in annual sales, but analysts on average do not expect avelumab, branded as Bavencio, to reach that status. Trial results have been mixed and it faces tough competition in a class of drugs dominated by Merck & Co’s Keytruda and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo. Merck, which is developing avelumab in an alliance with Pfizer, is in intense negotiations with prospective partners for other promising experimental drugs in its pipeline. The Merck family, which holds 70 percent of the shares, have pursued a diversified approach, with the group’s activities ranging from liquid crystals for flat screens and pearlescent pigments to fertility drugs and lab equipment.  At 7 billion euros ($8.4 billion) in 2017 healthcare revenues - including allergy treatments and a consumer care unit it is selling - Merck does not make the top 20 list of global pharma majors. Stangenberg-Haverkamp is one of two leading representatives of the roughly 150 family members that have voting rights in the family holding.
