Dr. M, as he is popularly known, was prime minister of Malaysia from 1981 to 2003, the first commoner to ever hold the post in a land with nine sultans. His demeanor suggests the country physician he once was, ready with a frank diagnosis — and in his first interview with the foreign media in five years, he doles out prescriptions for what ails his nation.	   The man who made Malaysia part of the “East Asia Miracle” with a massive inflow of foreign direct investment doesn’t think much of it today. The former miracle economy, now a muddle, needs a new policy direction, he says in his office in Putrajaya, the administrative capital he built on old plantation land in the 1990s.	   “We should not be too dependent on FDI anymore,” says Mahathir. “We’ve come to the stage when locals can invest. They have now the capital. They have the technology. They know the market. And I think they can manage big industries.”	   His thinking is at odds with government policy. But it gets to the heart of a debate over the future of Malaysia, a former emerging market star now in danger of becoming an also-ran, stuck in the dreaded “middle income trap.”	   Foreign investment has been dwindling since the onset of the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis. Capital outflows have even exceeded inflows in four of the past five years. This has been accompanied by an alarming “brain drain” of emigres voting with their feet against Malaysia’s prospects.	   Malaysia is counting on foreign investment to provide a quarter of the investments needed to fund projects under its “Economic Transformation Programme,” which aims to turn the country of 28 million into a fully developed nation by 2020.	   That comes to an average of more than $11 billion a year, compared with an average of $3.1 billion since 1997 — by any measure an ambitious target.	   The challenge is vastly more complicated by the exodus of talent that hits directly at Malaysia’s aspiration to become a high-income nation focused on knowledge-based industries.	   “For Malaysia to stand success in its journey to high income, it will need to develop, attract and retain talent,” the World Bank said in a March report. “Brain drain does not appear to square with this objective: Malaysia needs talent, but talent seems to be leaving.”	   The rise of China and India in the region has overshadowed the export-dependent “Tiger Cub” economies of Southeast Asia, all struggling with their own reforms. Thailand has been at a dangerous political impasse for six years. Indonesia is consistently ranked as among the world’s most corrupt countries. The Philippines is battling long-running insurgencies.	   Yet Malaysia does not compare well with its peers in the eyes of investors. A March report by Bank of America Merrill Lynch ranked Malaysia the second least popular market after Colombia among global emerging market fund managers and tied with India for least favourite among Asia-Pacific managers.	   A chief difficulty is the nation’s balky affirmative action programme.	   Ethnic Chinese account for most of the brain drain. The reason 60 percent of them gave for why they moved out of the motherland was “social injustice”, a World Bank survey says.	   They are referring to the “Bumiputra” (sons of the soil) policy that discriminates against Chinese and Indians, who account for a third of the population, in favour of majority Malays for all kinds of things — places in universities, jobs, shares in companies, home mortgages, government contracts.	   The government acknowledges the policy has been widely abused, with Malay front men offering their names to Chinese businesses to obtain government contracts, an arrangement known as “Ali Baba”, after the character in Arabian Nights who gains entrance to the treasure cave of the 40 thieves with the magic words “Open Sesame”.	   Prime Minister Najib Razak has launched a new edition of the policy called the New Economic Model that is meant to correct the inequities, mainly by making preferences need-based and not race-based.

Under his administration, the “Bumiputra rules” led to a mingling of politics and business that largely benefited a coterie of Malay and Chinese businessmen.  Huge government building projects kept the contracts flowing and the political machine running. Mahathir says as much in the interview, citing the slowdown in big projects as the reason for the steady attrition of Chinese support for his successors in office.  “What is happening is the Chinese feel that in the economic area, the business area, they are not receiving the kind of benefits they got during previous times,” he said. “The moment I stepped down, all the projects were stopped ... When you stop big government projects, a lot of people — well, their businesses will go down.”  In March, Mahathir published an 809-page autobiography, “A Doctor in the House.” His main motivation in writing it was “to make corrections of the opinions and the accusations that were leveled at me” — especially that he systematically undermined the judiciary.  It is the biggest stain on his record. He authorized the arrest of his deputy and heir apparent, Anwar Ibrahim, on sodomy and corruption charges after the two men fell out over how to handle the Asian financial crisis. The trial was denounced in and out of Malaysia as a farce that called into question the rule of law.  The financial crisis and Anwar’s conviction marked a watershed. Foreign investors became wary about Malaysia, and a country once a haven for foreign investment was shunned.  “Ten-twenty years ago, Malaysia was it,” said a regional president of a European-based distribution company. “But then came 1997 and the rule of law was exposed for what it was. We once looked at Malaysia for a regional headquarters but rule of law and the bumi policy made us choose Singapore instead.”  Mahathir retired in 2003, but Malaysia has yet to inspire confidence again. Economic growth has fallen along with investment, averaging 4.6 percent in the decade that ended in 2010 from an average 7.2 percent in the 1990s.  Putrajaya is a monument to Muslim Malay culture. Graceful minarets and gleaming blue domes dominate the skyline and a bridge across an artificial lake was inspired by the famous one in Isfahan, Iran. More than 90 percent of the residents are Bumiputras.  Across Putrajaya lake from Mahathir’s office is a curious community of knowledge workers called Cyberjaya. The town is a place where the contentious “bum rules” do not apply.  Cyberjaya (cyber success) is home to about 500 IT companies and two universities. It has a daytime population of 41,000 but only 14,000 fulltime residents sleep there overnight. This town is filled with futuristic-looking buildings but has few residential neighborhoods and little in the way of amenities, not yet anyway.  Cyberjaya was one of Mahathir’s last big projects. It was to be Malaysia’s answer to California’s Silicon Valley, the key difference being this one would be a ready-made town, built on old plantation land, in hopes technology innovators would come.  Cyberjaya offers foreign investors a waiver of the “Bumiputra” rules that require equity stakes and employment for ethnic Malays. It also guaranteed the Internet would not be censored, in a country that kept the media on a tight leash.  Cyberjaya was part of a grand plan to avoid the emerging market middle income trap Malaysia was falling into because it could no longer compete for manufacturing jobs, especially with China.  Then the financial crisis hit and Mahathir’s response spooked potential investors. Blaming Jewish conspirators for the crisis, he imposed capital controls to stop short-selling of the ringgit. Anwar was arrested the day after that.  Some $30 billion in portfolio investment fled Malaysia in 1997; most of it has yet to return. Key foreign investors scrapped plans for Cyberjaya and for years Malaysia struggled to woo them back. The effort now appears to be bearing fruit.  Last October, Hewlett Packard launched a multi-purpose client servicing center in Cyberjaya, the single biggest investment by a technology multinational in Malaysia. HP said it would provide 4,000 jobs. It joins Dell, DHL, IBM, Fujitsu, Nokia and DoCoMo among others in the 29-square-kilometer town.  Since 2009, Cyberjaya has attracted 7.12 billion ringgit ($2.37 billion) in investment, compared with a total of 4.62 billion ringgit in the previous 11 years.  Success has given Hafidz Hashim, managing director of Cyberview Sdn Bhd, the town’s developer, a new problem.  “Entertainment,” Hafiz said when asked what his “citizens” want the most. He is known as “the mayor of Cyberjaya because his company acts as both builder and city manager.  More than half the projected investment over the next three years will be for residential property, Hafidz said in an interview. Cyberview has already built a community center and clubhouse and plans to build a huge entertainment complex, along with more shops and restaurants.  It is far from Malaysia’s answer to Silicon Valley, though. Cyberjaya is home to server farms, data storage facilities and client service centers, the low end of the Internet economy. There is little in the way of R&D underway.  Arvin Singh, 22, has just quit his job at the HP plant because he was “constantly doing the same thing over and over again” and not growing on the job. Most of his co-workers were content to remain in this “comfort zone,” he said.  “But one must constantly work to expand one’s knowledge,” Singh says, adding he plans to study overseas to get further qualified.  Hafidz said one of his biggest challenges is meeting the skills companies in Cyberjaya need, and which Malaysia’s education system is not providing. He has set up a “Knowledge Workers Development Institute” where companies can send workers for training, and on-the-job training programs.  Cyberjaya’s success after a sputtering start has inspired similar projects in the country.  The most ambitious is one emerging just north of Singapore called Iskandar Malaysia. It will eventually be a metropolis three times the size of Singapore with theme parks, international schools and colleges, hotels and hospitals, a movie studio, a financial center and luxury homes. It has attracted $23 billion in promised investments, nearly half from overseas.  Iskandar is one of five “economic growth corridors” Malaysia is developing with incentives to foreign investors. They are, in effect, investment zones ring-fenced from the mainstream economy where business and politics have long entwined.  Months after Mahathir took power in 1981, a Malaysian Chinese banker packed up his family in the southern city of Johor Bahru and moved to Singapore. He had grown uneasy about the future as Mahathir took an increasingly interventionist approach to the economy and ramped up the affirmative action policy.  Those uncertainties have only increased for a Chinese community that abandoned the ruling National Front coalition in the 2008 general election and are now deserting the country in ever mounting numbers. The World Bank said the Malaysian diaspora has quadrupled over the past three decades.  “People are unhappy about the way the (policy) has been exploited, the way it has degenerated into some kind of apartheid policy,” said the banker, who requested only his surname, Lee, be used.  “They say come back, we’ll give you tax breaks. But when you move back, you’re not talking just about your career, but your children’s future. And it’s this perception of uncertainty that holds them back. They feel the society they have moved to is more assuring that the one they came from.”  Lee’s son, a medical doctor, said the overseas Malaysian Chinese community has now become anxious about the growing force of political Islam. Last year, 10 churches and two mosques were desecrated after a Malaysian high court ruled Christians could use the word Allah for God in their literature.  “A lot of people are now worried about a hyper-religious government taking power, and then all that they worked so hard for goes up in smoke.”  Kalimullah Hassan, former Group Editor of Malaysia’s pro-government New Straits Times publications, understands their anxiety.  A Bumiputra himself, Kalimullah worries about the emergence of right-wing politicians trying to win back Malays, nearly half of whom voted for a multi-ethnic opposition coalition headed by Anwar Ibrahim in 2008.  “To unite the Malays, they raise the bogeyman - other races, specifically the Chinese and foreigners who are supposedly out to displace the Malays in their own homeland - and in doing so, they’ve upped the ante in race relations,” Kalimullah says.  The politics of patronage is no longer working because there isn’t enough largesse to spread around in a country whose population has nearly tripled since 1970 and with capital inflows and growth slowing, Kalimullah says. What Malaysia needs now more than ever is the meritocracy Prime Minister Najib has proposed in his New Economic Model. Otherwise its human capital will be stunted, he says.  “In the mid-to-long term, Malaysia is going to be left further behind by a world which has already realized that human capital is its greatest asset.”  ",7072011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-malaysia/special-report-can-malaysia-reform-and-discriminate-idUSTRE7660UZ20110707

Anwar was arrested the day after that.  Some $30 billion in portfolio investment fled Malaysia in 1997; most of it has yet to return. Key foreign investors scrapped plans for Cyberjaya and for years Malaysia struggled to woo them back. The effort now appears to be bearing fruit.  Last October, Hewlett Packard launched a multi-purpose client servicing center in Cyberjaya, the single biggest investment by a technology multinational in Malaysia. HP said it would provide 4,000 jobs. It joins Dell, DHL, IBM, Fujitsu, Nokia and DoCoMo among others in the 29-square-kilometre town.  Since 2009, Cyberjaya has attracted 7.12 billion ringgit ($2.37 billion) in investment, compared with a total of 4.62 billion ringgit in the previous 11 years.  Success has given Hafidz Hashim, managing director of Cyberview Sdn Bhd, the town’s developer, a new problem.  “Entertainment,” Hafiz said when asked what his “citizens” want the most. He is known as “the mayor of Cyberjaya because his company acts as both builder and city manager.  More than half the projected investment over the next three years will be for residential property, Hafidz said in an interview. Cyberview has already built a community center and clubhouse and plans to build a huge entertainment complex, along with more shops and restaurants.  It is far from Malaysia’s answer to Silicon Valley, though. Cyberjaya is home to server farms, data storage facilities and client service centers, the low end of the Internet economy. There is little in the way of R&D underway.  Arvin Singh, 22, has just quit his job at the HP plant because he was “constantly doing the same thing over and over again” and not growing on the job. Most of his co-workers were content to remain in this “comfort zone,” he said.  “But one must constantly work to expand one’s knowledge,” Singh says, adding he plans to study overseas to get further qualified.  Hafidz said one of his biggest challenges is meeting the skills companies in Cyberjaya need, and which Malaysia’s education system is not providing. He has set up a “Knowledge Workers Development Institute” where companies can send workers for training, and on-the-job training programs.  Cyberjaya’s success after a sputtering start has inspired similar projects in the country.  The most ambitious is one emerging just north of Singapore called Iskandar Malaysia. It will eventually be a metropolis three times the size of Singapore with theme parks, international schools and colleges, hotels and hospitals, a movie studio, a financial center and luxury homes. It has attracted $23 billion in promised investments, nearly half from overseas.  Iskandar is one of five “economic growth corridors” Malaysia is developing with incentives to foreign investors. They are, in effect, investment zones ring-fenced from the mainstream economy where business and politics have long entwined.  Months after Mahathir took power in 1981, a Malaysian Chinese banker packed up his family in the southern city of Johor Bahru and moved to Singapore. He had grown uneasy about the future as Mahathir took an increasingly interventionist approach to the economy and ramped up the affirmative action policy.  Those uncertainties have only increased for a Chinese community that abandoned the ruling National Front coalition in the 2008 general election and are now deserting the country in ever mounting numbers. The World Bank said the Malaysian diaspora has quadrupled over the past three decades.  “People are unhappy about the way the (policy) has been exploited, the way it has degenerated into some kind of apartheid policy,” said the banker, who requested only his surname, Lee, be used.  “They say come back, we’ll give you tax breaks. But when you move back, you’re not talking just about your career, but your children’s future. And it’s this perception of uncertainty that holds them back. They feel the society they have moved to is more assuring that the one they came from.”  Lee’s son, a medical doctor, said the overseas Malaysian Chinese community has now become anxious about the growing force of political Islam. Last year, 10 churches and two mosques were desecrated after a Malaysian high court ruled Christians could use the word Allah for God in their literature.  “A lot of people are now worried about a hyper-religious government taking power, and then all that they worked so hard for goes up in smoke.”  Kalimullah Hassan, former Group Editor of Malaysia’s pro-government New Straits Times publications, understands their anxiety.  A Bumiputra himself, Kalimullah worries about the emergence of right-wing politicians trying to win back Malays, nearly half of whom voted for a multi-ethnic opposition coalition headed by Anwar Ibrahim in 2008.  “To unite the Malays, they raise the bogeyman - other races, specifically the Chinese and foreigners who are supposedly out to displace the Malays in their own homeland - and in doing so, they’ve upped the ante in race relations,” Kalimullah says.  The politics of patronage is no longer working because there isn’t enough largesse to spread around in a country whose population has nearly tripled since 1970 and with capital inflows and growth slowing, Kalimullah says. What Malaysia needs now more than ever is the meritocracy Prime Minister Najib has proposed in his New Economic Model. Otherwise its human capital will be stunted, he says.  “In the mid-to-long term, Malaysia is going to be left further behind by a world which has already realised that human capital is its greatest asset.”  ",7082011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-malaysia/special-report-can-malaysia-reform-and-discriminate-idUSTRE7670RE20110708

5,IBM,UPDATE 4-Infosys cautious on outlook after Q1 disappoints," * Q1 profit 17.22 bln rupees vs 17.29 bln rupees in Reuters poll   * Maintains fiscal 2012 dollar revenue growth at 18-20 percent   * Adds 26 clients in Q1, slowest pace in at least four years   * Growth in second half will be better than first half-exec   * Shares fall as much as 6 percent in a weak Mumbai market   (Adds details, updates share price)	   By Tenzin Dekeva and Sayantani Ghosh	   MYSORE, India, July 12 (Reuters) - India’s No.2 software services exporter Infosys Ltd warned on Tuesday it faces a volatile global economy that could slow client spending, sending its shares down the most in three months.	   The company, long considered a bellwether for India’s showcase $76 billion software and services sector, disclosed its new client additions were the lowest in at least four years.	   Its costs are also increasing because it is paying higher wages to retain talent in the ultra-competitive industry that added 240,000 jobs in the last fiscal year to March 31.	   Infosys narrowly missed expectations with a 15.4 percent rise in first-quarter profit, the fourth time in five quarters it has fallen short of expectations. 	   “Infosys has been losing the habit of out-performing on expectations,” said Tejas Doshi at Sushil Finance in Mumbai. 	   Infosys, however, expects growth in the second half of its fiscal year to be better than the first half on increased spending by clients in sectors such as retail and energy, B.G. Srinivas, a member of the Infosys board, told Reuters.	   Analysts had expected Infosys to upgrade its cautious forecast as investors had already factored in higher revenue growth for the full year.	   Its shares were hammered in Mumbai, falling as much as 6 percent. The stock was trading down 5 percent at 0900 GMT in a Mumbai market down 2 percent.    	   The earnings announcement comes about two weeks after U.S. technology outsourcing and consulting firm Accenture  raised its annual earnings forecast and posted results that beat Wall Street estimates. 	   U.S. companies often benefit at the expense of their Indian rivals when U.S. spending slows and American companies get criticised for outsourcing overseas.	   Bangalore-based Infosys , also listed on the Nasdaq, said consolidated net profit rose to 17.22 billion rupees ($387 million), from 14.88 billion rupees a year earlier. Revenue rose about 21 percent to 74.85 billion rupees.	   A Reuters poll of brokerages had forecast a profit of 17.29 billion rupees on revenue of 75.2 billion rupees for the company, which counts Goldman Sachs , BT Group and BP among its main clients.    	   “This is an environment where we need to be cautious. You can look at all the things which are happening,” said the company’s chief operating officer, S.D. Shibulal, who will take over as chief executive next month.	   “There is still economic instability...there is the European crisis still unfolding. There is always talk about the government spending coming to an end,” he said.	   European shares fell on Tuesday as officials struggled to contain fears that the euro zone debt crisis was spreading to Italy and Spain. 	    More than 70 percent of Infosys’ revenue is generated in the United States and Europe, “making Infosys vulnerable to the global economy and creating volatility for the company,” said John Lin, manager of Uni-President Asset Management’s Chindia Fund in Taiwan.	   “Top-line growth is faster than bottom-line growth, meaning its costs are rising more than the company had forecast.”	   Infosys maintained its dollar revenue growth forecast at 18 percent to 20 percent for the fiscal year ending March 2012 to $7.13 billion to $7.25 billion. Analysts expected full-year  growth of 20 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.	   The firm slightly raised its earnings per American shares growth forecast to 10-11.5 percent from 8-10 percent view in April.	   “At this point of time we are very cautious because the global economic environment has not recovered. The volatility still continues,” said Infosys chief financial officer, V. Balakrishnan.	   “All the uncertainty we talked about in the last quarter still remains. In fact, in Europe it has only now become bigger,” he told a television channel.	   Infosys added 26 clients in the quarter, its slowest pace of quarterly customer acquisition in at least four years, highlighting global economic uncertainty and concerns about top management changes at the company.	   In April, Infosys announced the retirement of its billionaire chairman, N.R. Narayana Murthy, who will step down in August, and said current chief executive, S. Gopalakrishnan, will become co-chairman.	   The board also said S.D. Shibulal, a founder of the company and currently chief operating officer, will become the new chief executive.	   Infosys posted a 15.4 percent rise in fiscal first quarter profit, but was hurt as wage hikes crimped margins amid intense competition from rivals such as IBM , Accenture and Tata Consultancy.	   Infosys executives on Tuesday said a growth rate of 18 to 20 percent was not enough to help the company absorb the wage increases of more than 10 percent.	   “There is one negative that the full-year dollar revenue guidance has not been increased,” said Rohit Anand, an analyst at PINC Research. “The major concern is demand at this point of time. So I think the key number is the full-year outlook.”	   The Infosys results and management comments triggered worries about the sector outlook with shares in rival Tata Consultancy falling 1.4 percent and Wipro trading 2.7 percent lower. Tata Consultancy and Wipro report earnings later this month.	    While Infosys expressed caution on Tuesday, India’s IT sector is growing due to improved pricing for its services and increased outsourcing by companies looking to cut costs and boost efficiency.	   According to research firm Gartner, the global IT market will expand 7.1 percent this year, up from its previous projection of 5.6 percent growth, which bodes well for top Indian exporters like Infosys. 	   Operating margins at Infosys about 3 percent in the quarter ended June and Balakrishnan said the margins were expected to drop 2.5 percent in the fiscal year to March 2012, less than a previous forecast of a 3 percent fall.

U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan approved the settlement on Monday, the filing shows.

9,IBM,Samsung study rejects claims semiconductor plants caused cancers,"GIHEUNG, South Korea (Reuters) - A study commissioned by Samsung Electronics rejected assertions that employees may have been exposed to carcinogenic chemicals at its plants, as several cancer-stricken former employees of the world’s top memory chipmaker seek compensation for their illnesses.  Despite the findings, the South Korean firm said it would consider offering financial support for some of its former employees diagnosed with cancer, following allegations by civic groups and some former employees that its working environment caused leukemia.  Samsung says 26 of its employees who worked at its chip plants had been diagnosed with leukemia or lymphoma, and 10 of them had died of cancer. Civic groups say there are many more workers who have gotten ill due to hazardous working environment.  Samsung commissioned U.S. consulting firm Environ Corp last year to conduct an investigation following continued pressure, despite two previous studies by the government, which found no problems at Samsung’s plants.  Samsung is the world’s largest chipmaker after Intel Corp and earned $27.8 billion from chip sales last year. Its sprawling semiconductor factories in Giheung, where its chip business first started in early 1980s, employ more than 30,000 people.  The study focused on six cases involved in compensation claims and concluded there was no link between workplace exposure and diagnosed cancers.  “We did not find a link between exposure to cancer-causing chemicals and the health conditions of six employees,” Paul Harper, principal of the health sciences consulting firm, told reporters on Thursday.  Formaldehyde, ionizing radiation and trichloroethylene were the only chemicals and agents used or detected on Samsung’s lines that are known to be related to the cancers in question, Environ said.  None of the six cases were exposed to the carcinogens in sufficient quantities to be associated with increased risks of cancer, Environ said.  The old chip production lines where employees worked and later developed the illnesses were converted into chip test lines and light emitting diode production lines. The study was based on reconstructed exposures estimated by similar exposure groups.  The finding comes after a Seoul court last month ruled in favor of two former Samsung employees. In its ruling, the Seoul Administrative Court said although the precise cause of the workers’ illness wasn’t clear, it can be construed that their exposures to chemicals may have had some connection with their illness.  A total of nine cases are filed against the government-run Korea Workers Compensation & Welfare Service but not directly against Samsung.  The government fund said it appealed against the ruling on Thursday and Samsung said its review was not aimed at influencing the court case.  “It’s not part of our legal strategy but rather part of our attempt to fully access whether there are any problems in Samsung’s working environment,” a Samsung executive in legal department told reporters.  Civic groups and activists expressed skepticism about results of the study, which was reviewed by researchers from Harvard University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Michigan and Yale University.  Samsung didn’t disclose the full report of the review, citing confidentiality agreement with its chemicals suppliers, and said it will consider releasing parts of the document after more review.  If the court case is finalized as industrial accident, it could deal a blow to the reputation of Samsung, which boasts a global high-tech manufacturer of flat screens, semiconductors and handsets.  Samsung reiterated on Thursday that chemicals used during the chip making process at its plants had not caused the cancers.  “Samsung has worked to transparently address questions about workplace health and safety...We believe this study...is consistent with previous studies that found no correlation between the workplace environment and employee illness,” Kwon Oh-hyun, head of Samsung’s chip business, told reporters.  The reputation of the electronics sector as a clean industry has been challenged in the past decade by cancer developments from those who worked at computer parts manufacturer.  In 2003, two former workers of International Business Machine sued the firm, claiming their exposure to chemicals in computer disk drive factory made them sick and ultimately gave them cancer.  Later the claim was cleared by a U.S. court, and IBM commissioned independent review, which concluded that its workplace conditions did not cause cancer or other fatal illnesses.

11,IBM,"Analysis: Google antitrust watchers: Place your bets, please","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The antitrust probe into Google Inc (GOOG.O) could hem in its growth ambitions for years, even if regulators do not unleash their most formidable weapons: Seeking a breakup of the Internet giant or exerting control over its cherished search algorithm.  The Federal Trade Commission’s probe into business practices at Google, announced last month, puts it in the company of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), IBM (IBM.N) and other once-dominant businesses that landed in the government’s crosshairs. In perhaps the most drastic case, the process led to the break-up of AT&T Corporation.  Some analysts and investors believe Google will strike a settlement with the government to avoid the distraction and business risk that would come with a prolonged court fight.  But they also note that a worst-case outcome could curtail Google’s growth prospects and undermine its position at the top of an increasingly competitive Internet industry, with Facebook, Groupon and others already stealing the limelight.  David Balto, a former policy director for the FTC, said government efforts to oversee Google’s day-to-day operations could cramp its ability to innovate.  “It would be like putting mittens on Da Vinci’s hands,” he said. “We’d still get paintings but they would be nowhere as brilliant.”  Balto and other legal experts say a break-up of Google is nearly inconceivable, however. Forced divestitures of business are considered an extreme measure that regulators are loath to take for fear of hurting innovation and business efficiencies.  Nor is it easy: a federal judge sided with the regulators in 2000 and ordered software giant Microsoft split into two companies, but the decision was overturned on appeal.  “An antitrust investigation like this is of the utmost importance to a company like Google,” said Robert Lande, a director at the American Antitrust Institute, who formerly worked for the FTC’s bureau of competition. “The worst-case scenario could be very dramatic consequences.”  He stressed however that at this stage it’s impossible to predict how the FTC will act and noted that the agency drops many investigations without ever bringing charges. The AAI has said it supports the government investigation into Google but has not taken a position on whether any remedies are required.  Easier than dismantling mergers, in which Google could argue that extricating acquired technology from its services would cause severe disruption, is preventing new mergers, say legal experts.  Regulators have started taking a harder look at Google’s acquisitions, such as last year’s AdMob and travel software company ITA Software. While Google ultimately got the green light to complete both of those deals, some analysts and investors worry that it may not be as lucky in the future.  Google controls more than two-thirds of the global search market. But new Web technologies, such as social networking, smartphone applications and location-based services, offer new ways for people to find information online.  To stay relevant, Google needs to constantly adapt to the times, revamping and expanding its offerings. Last year Google acquired more than 40 companies.  “The biggest risk is that they would feel encumbered by whatever decision is made in order to expand beyond their core search business,” said Evercore Partners analyst Ken Sena.  “If Google doesn’t feel like they can really adapt their product or add new features, that itself is a pretty big negative.”  For now, Wall Street appears to be more concerned with Google’s financial performance. Shares surged more than 13 percent on Friday after stellar second-quarter results. Google executives on the earnings conference call were not asked a single question about the regulatory scrutiny.  Google has said little about the FTC probe since disclosing it last month, other than saying that it does not believe it has done anything wrong and will work with the commission.  But the pressure is mounting. The company also faces antitrust investigations from several states and in the European Union, and has begun bulking up its legal team with antitrust experts and lobbyists.  Critics contend that Google’s uses its search dominance to gain an unfair advantage over rivals, giving top-billing to its own services such as online maps, shopping and travel.  The allegations have put a spotlight on Google’s algorithm, which uses hundreds of “ranking factors” to determine which Web sites float to the top of its search results.  The algorithm is the closest thing to a state secret for Google, and fiercely protected by the company. Meddling with it could be a complex and onerous process for the government.  “If the problem relates to bias in search results, that’s extremely hard for any governmental agency to rectify,” said David Yoffie, a professor at Harvard Business School.  One antitrust remedy, known as a “must-carry” rule that effectively forces a monopoly to provide access to competing services, is not as clear-cut with a search engine compared to requiring a cable television provider to carry certain television stations, explained Yoffie, a former member of the Justice Department’s commission on international anti-trust.  “You say that sounds like a good idea, but then you say — OK, well, which five competitors do you show?,” he explained.  “It’s a lot harder in Google’s case because they have so many software products and services that one could argue that they are favoring with their search,” he said.  Some see a potential model in the government’s policing of Microsoft, in which an expert committee was created to oversee some practices and look into complaints on case-by-case.  “They were all over whatever Microsoft was doing,” said Gary Reback, an antitrust attorney who was involved in the Microsoft case and now represents clients opposed to Google.  A similar committee could provide an effective way to look into complaints of favoritism in Google’s search algorithm, Reback said.

On Wednesday, the former high-school beauty queen and hedge fund trader is expected to learn how many days — or years — she will in fact spend behind bars for insider trading.   Chiesi, 45, pleaded guilty in January to three conspiracy counts. She is the first major defendant to be sentenced in the government insider-trading probe, unveiled in October 2009 and centered on Galleon Group hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam.   Prosecutors have called Chiesi the “consummate Wall Street insider.” They said the former trader at New Castle Funds, a now-closed New York hedge fund that was once part of Bear Stearns Cos, schmoozed powerful sources to get inside tips about corporate activity and tried to hide her tracks.   Not true, Chiesi’s lawyers said in court papers arguing for leniency. They called her an emotionally scarred victim of a gnarled love affair with her former boss. “Dani,” they said, had an unhealthy desire to please and to avoid rejection.   “The question is whether the mitigating factors were much more severe or pronounced than what a typical defendant would have,” said Stanley Twardy, a partner at Day Pitney and a former U.S. attorney in Connecticut. “Courts do not typically give great weight to a failed relationship in deciding whether to lower a sentence.”   U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell in Manhattan will impose Chiesi’s sentence.   Prosecutors recommended a 37- to 46-month prison term, reflecting federal guidelines that Holwell need not follow.   Chiesi is seeking fewer than 27 months, the punishment that the former boss, Mark Kurland, got for his guilty plea from a different judge. Last week, she agreed to a $540,535 settlement of a related Securities and Exchange Commission civil probe.   Holwell has leeway in sentencing to consider such factors as Chiesi’s mental state, her motivations, and the pressures she faced, said Mark Rankin, co-chairman of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.   “Given that her boss got 27 months I could see the judge at least sentencing her below the guidelines range,” said Rankin, who is also a partner at Shutts & Bowen in Tampa, Florida.   Chiesi is one of just two women among the 26 people charged criminally in the Galleon probe.   Twenty-one pleaded guilty, including the other woman, Roomy Khan. Four were convicted at trial. One is missing.   At her January plea hearing, Chiesi tearfully admitted to “crossing the line” by leaking tips about companies such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.N and International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N). [ID:nN19229868]   Recorded telephone calls, some risque, played at Rajaratnam’s trial had shown Chiesi gloating that getting inside tips was a “conquest.” Prosecutors contended she made $4 million from insider trading.   But her lawyers maintained she never paid or was paid for tips and never traded in her own account.   Chiesi has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and “greed and venality” did not drive her actions, her lawyers said. Indeed, it was her relationships with men that were a much bigger factor, they said.   Among these men: former IBM executive Robert Moffat, who pleaded guilty in the case and was freed from prison on May 3.   Another was Kurland, her lover for nearly 20 years and who Chiesi’s lawyers said exploited her as his “virtual servant.”   The fates of other defendants could guide Holwell in sentencing Chiesi, said Jeff Ifrah, co-author of the book “Federal Sentencing for Business Crimes.”   “A judge could look at how Chiesi compares to similarly situated co-defendants and slot her based on the egregiousness of her conduct,” Ifrah said. “One factor is how much personal financial gain there was. Rajaratnam is at the top of that list while Chiesi is at the bottom.”   Holwell’s actions could also hint at the type of punishment he might mete out for Rajaratnam, lawyers said.   Still, Rajaratnam’s larger crime and refusal to settle will result in a far harsher penalty, they added.   A jury convicted Rajaratnam on May 11 on 14 counts related to insider trading, which prosecutors said led to $63.8 million of illegal gains. He could face up to 19-1/2 years in prison under federal guidelines. His sentencing is set for Sept. 27.   Holwell’s “manner and tone” in describing Chiesi’s behavior could be a harbinger for Rajaratnam, Twardy said.   “If he suggests that people were really hurt, then he might come down hard,” he said. “If he suggests the conduct was typical Wall Street conduct, it might signal he would not be as tough.”   The case is U.S. v. Chiesi, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 09-01184.

13,IBM,"UPDATE 5-IBM's services signings surge, stock rises"," * Signings up better-than-expected 16 percent   * Sets positive tone for tech earns, corporate spending   * Shares rise 2 percent  (Adds comment from IBM execs on Europe, hardware sales)    By Jim Finkle    BOSTON, July 18 (Reuters) - IBM’s (IBM.N) signings of new business at its services division surged 16 percent in the second quarter, trouncing expectations and raising hopes that  2011 will be a good year for the technology sector.   Investors had feared that technology sales would slow in the second half, hurt by the economic uncertainty in Europe and Japan, as well as a drop in government spending. But IBM offset those challenges with strong growth in developing markets from Brazil to China, and robust sales of a new line of mainframe computers.   Analysts said the results marked a strong start to the tech earnings season, with other bellwethers such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) set to report quarterly results in coming days. [ID:nN1E76H1KN]   “As I look for the balance of the earnings reports this week, I think it’s going to set a pretty good tone,” said Keith Wirtz, chief investment officer for Fifth third Asset Management.   International Business Machines Corp shares climbed 2 percent to a record high on the news. The company also raised its full-year profit forecast after second-quarter results beat Wall Street estimates.   “Good service signings reflect that they are capturing their share of the solid IT spending that we’re seeing in the market now,” said Edward Jones analyst Josh Olson.   “IT spending and demand for software and services remains healthy despite all this economic turmoil, and businesses continue to invest in efficiency,” he said. “We’re seeing that in these results.” ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    Graphic showing Q2 overview: tech and telecom   r.reuters.com/nuw62s ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>   IBM said on Monday that signings rose to $14.3 billion during the second quarter, beating Wall Street projections and easing investor concerns after the closely watched number dropped in the first quarter.   Deutsche Bank said in a research note that analysts on average had expected signings of $12 billion to $13 billion.   Investors believe signings is a key indicator of future profits. But IBM says the focus should be more on total backlog of business, which grew by $15 billion during the quarter to $144 billion.   Some $8 billion of the $15 billion increase in backlog came from the developing economies that IBM defines as “growth markets.”   Some investors had feared that corporations will keep a tight grip on 2011 technology budgets, waiting out the economic uncertainty in the United States and Europe.   But developing markets drove top line growth for IBM. On a constant-currency basis, revenue leaped 13 percent in growth markets — which includes the BRIC countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China — far outpacing the 3 percent sales growth chalked up in so-called major markets.   The growth in developing countries was led by sales to financial services firms and communications companies.   “We’ve got real momentum in the financial service sector. It’s a strong place for us,” Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said.   He added that business in Europe had improved, with sales in Germany and Italy returning to growth during the quarter.   IBM reported second-quarter profit, excluding items, of $3.09 per share, beating the average Wall Street forecast of $3.03, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   Revenue rose 12 percent from a year earlier to $26.67 billion, ahead of the average forecast of $25.35 billion.   Shares in the Armonk, New York, company rose to $178.90 in extended trade, beating the previous record high of $177.76 on July 6. They had fallen 26 cents to $175.28 in regular New York Stock Exchange trade on Monday.   Analysts said Wall Street had priced in strong growth expectations, limiting the stock’s after-hours rally.   “Expectations are pretty high for this name right now. We’ve seen it do very well this year, up 20 percent or so to date,” Olson said   Sales of IBM’s Unix server computers rose 12 percent from a year earlier.   The company said it won more than 250 server accounts away from rivals, resulting in over $300 million in sales. About 60 percent of this came from Oracle Corp ORCL.O and 30 percent from Hewlett Packard Co (HPQ.N), IBM said.   Both Oracle and HP declined to comment.

14,IBM,Wall Street drops on global debt woes,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks dropped on Monday as bank shares bore the brunt of investor frustration over governments’ inability to solve debt crises in the United States and Europe.  With five days to go before President Barack Obama’s deadline for a debt ceiling deal and no agreement in sight, Republicans and Democrats were crafting a fallback plan to avert a U.S. default.  The longer the debt ceiling debate remains unresolved, the bigger the risk for further declines in stocks and a spike in volatility. The CBOE Volatility index .VIX rose 7.8 percent on Monday after a gain of more than 20 percent last week.  Adding to pressure on financials, the euro zone’s regulatory stress tests for banks were viewed as unrealistically soft, given the scope of the crisis.  “It’s not a good environment for financials,” said Terry Morris, senior equity manager for National Penn Investors Trust Company in Reading, Pennsylvania.  “The market is really scared right now and it’s a fragile economy that we have, so when you throw something like this in the cake, then you have investors sitting on the sidelines or selling.”  Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) hit a new 52-week low and ended down 2.8 percent to $9.72 while Citigroup Inc (C.N) lost 1.7 percent to $37.74. Financials were the weakest S&P sector on Monday, losing 1.4 percent.  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI dropped 94.57 points, or 0.76 percent, to 12,385.16. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX declined 10.70 points, or 0.81 percent, to 1,305.44. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC fell 24.69 points, or 0.89 percent, to 2,765.11.  Expectations of strong earnings could fuel optimism, but it may not be enough to lift the market from its recent decline. Last week’s encouraging results from Google Inc (GOOG.O) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) were overshadowed by global economic worries that sparked the S&P 500’s worst performance in five weeks.  In the latest earnings news, Halliburton Co (HAL.N) reported a 54 percent jump in quarterly profit as a U.S. onshore drilling boom showed no sign of cooling off. The stock edged up 4 cents to $53.12.  Second-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are seen rising 6.5 percent, and of the 44 companies in the S&P reporting so far, 75 percent posted higher-than-expected profits, according to Thomson Reuters Proprietary Research.  After the closing bell, International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) said quarterly profit rose 8 percent from a year earlier, buoyed by strong growth in sales of its computers and software. Shares gained 2.4 percent to $179.45 in extended trading.

15,IBM,"Instant view: IBM's Q2 results, signings beat Street","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp reported a surge in signings of new business at its services division during the second quarter, substantially beating Wall Street expectations and signaling businesses are still spending on technology.  Its shares rose 2 percent as the company also raised its forecast for full-year profit and released second-quarter results that beat Wall Street projections.  Commentary:  “Looks like a pretty solid report, especially with the signing number. Backlog is up, services up.”  “All of the growth markets performed well and inline and even ahead of expectations. We saw software revenue up 10 percent on an adjusted basis, hardware continues to do well, margins were good.  “It was a good quarter, solid quarter across all sectors and we also saw service signings come up 16 percent, and that’s important as they were soft last quarter and they’re going up against easy compares.  “Good service signings reflect that they are capturing their share of the solid IT spending that we’re seeing in the market now.  “IT spending and demand for software and services remains healthy despite all this economic turmoil, and businesses continue to invest in efficiency. We’re seeing that in these results.  “Expectations are pretty high for this name right now. We’ve seen it do very well this year, up 20 percent or so to date. We just think perhaps a lot of those expectations are already in the stock price.”  “Look at those numbers and you can see IBM is firing on all cylinders. They’ve exceeded all expectations.”  KEITH WIRTZ, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, FIFTH THIRD ASSET MANAGEMENT  “IBM’s results in my view satisfied my expectations as a shareholder and as I look for the balance of the earnings reports this week, I think it’s going to set a pretty good tone.  “It was a solid report. They not only exceeded expectations on the top line, they exceeded expectations on the net ... Backlog on the services side was better than expected.”  “Probably the main takeaway is that bookings were ahead of expectations on the services side, and they raised full year guidance.”  “It’s a good quarter. They raised full-year guide. So from an execution basis, all the numbers look good. But what will move the stock near-term is that signings number.  “If you adjusted the currency, revenue is still growing at 5 percent year over year. That’s still impressive given how big and defensive IBM is.  “The big thing that has always tended to move the stock rightfully or wrongfully near-term has always been the services signing number, which they haven’t disclosed yet. That’s the number that everyone kind of focuses on.”  I’m a little confused as to why the shares are down because the margins were very strong and the revenue, especially in the second quarter when you expect softer revenue, makes it look like they did well in the quarter.  “Margins are the name of the game for this business. Through the years, they’ve divested themselves of the more commodity-like businesses and I think it shows they are managing their business and have picked correctly.”  RICHARD SICHEL, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, PHILADELPHIA TRUST  “They beat on earnings per share and they beat pretty well on their revenues versus expectations. They did raise their guidance by 10 cents so I would say, in general, it looks like a good report.  “If the stock is down, it is based on high expectations on the stock, which has performed well versus the market this year.”  ",7182011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ibm-view/instant-view-ibms-q2-results-signings-beat-street-idUSTRE76H5F920110718

17,IBM,"Analysis: Google antitrust watchers: Place your bets, please","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The U.S. antitrust probe into Google Inc could hem in its growth ambitions for years, even if regulators do not unleash their most formidable weapons: Seeking a breakup of the giant Internet company or exerting control over its cherished search algorithm.  The Federal Trade Commission’s probe into business practices at Google, announced last month, puts it in the company of Microsoft Corp, IBM and other once-dominant businesses that landed in the government’s crosshairs. In perhaps the most drastic case, the process led to the break-up of AT&T Corporation.  Some analysts and investors believe Google will strike a settlement with the government to avoid the distraction and business risk that would come with a prolonged court fight.  But they also note that a worst-case outcome could curtail Google’s growth prospects and undermine its position at the top of an increasingly competitive Internet industry, with Facebook, Groupon and others already stealing the limelight.  David Balto, a former policy director for the FTC, said government efforts to oversee Google’s day-to-day operations could cramp its ability to innovate.  “It would be like putting mittens on Da Vinci’s hands,” he said. “We’d still get paintings but they would be nowhere as brilliant.”  Balto and other legal experts say a break-up of Google is nearly inconceivable, however. Forced divestitures of business are considered an extreme measure that regulators are loath to take for fear of hurting innovation and business efficiencies.  Nor is it easy: a federal judge sided with the regulators in 2000 and ordered software giant Microsoft split into two companies, but the decision was overturned on appeal.  “An antitrust investigation like this is of the utmost importance to a company like Google,” said Robert Lande, a director at the American Antitrust Institute, who formerly worked for the FTC’s bureau of competition. “The worst-case scenario could be very dramatic consequences.”  He stressed however that at this stage it’s impossible to predict how the FTC will act and noted that the agency drops many investigations without ever bringing charges. The AAI has said it supports the government investigation into Google but has not taken a position on whether any remedies are required.  Easier than dismantling mergers, in which Google could argue that extricating acquired technology from its services would cause severe disruption, is preventing new mergers, say legal experts.  Regulators have started taking a harder look at Google’s acquisitions, such as last year’s AdMob and travel software company ITA Software. While Google ultimately got the green light to complete both of those deals, some analysts and investors worry that it may not be as lucky in the future.  Google controls more than two-thirds of the global search market. But new Web technologies, such as social networking, smartphone applications and location-based services, offer new ways for people to find information online.  To stay relevant, Google needs to constantly adapt to the times, revamping and expanding its offerings. Last year Google acquired more than 40 companies.  “The biggest risk is that they would feel encumbered by whatever decision is made in order to expand beyond their core search business,” said Evercore Partners analyst Ken Sena.  “If Google doesn’t feel like they can really adapt their product or add new features, that itself is a pretty big negative.”  For now, Wall Street appears to be more concerned with Google’s financial performance. Shares surged more than 13 percent on Friday after stellar second-quarter results. Google executives on the earnings conference call were not asked a single question about the regulatory scrutiny.  Google has said little about the FTC probe since disclosing it last month, other than saying that it does not believe it has done anything wrong and will work with the commission.  But the pressure is mounting. The company also faces antitrust investigations from several states and in the European Union, and has begun bulking up its legal team with antitrust experts and lobbyists.  Critics contend that Google’s uses its search dominance to gain an unfair advantage over rivals, giving top-billing to its own services such as online maps, shopping and travel.  The allegations have put a spotlight on Google’s algorithm, which uses hundreds of “ranking factors” to determine which Web sites float to the top of its search results.  The algorithm is the closest thing to a state secret for Google, and fiercely protected by the company. Meddling with it could be a complex and onerous process for the government.  “If the problem relates to bias in search results, that’s extremely hard for any governmental agency to rectify,” said David Yoffie, a professor at Harvard Business School.  One antitrust remedy, known as a “must-carry” rule that effectively forces a monopoly to provide access to competing services, is not as clear-cut with a search engine compared to requiring a cable television provider to carry certain television stations, explained Yoffie, a former member of the Justice Department’s commission on international anti-trust.  “You say that sounds like a good idea, but then you say — OK, well, which five competitors do you show?,” he explained.  “It’s a lot harder in Google’s case because they have so many software products and services that one could argue that they are favoring with their search,” he said.  Some see a potential model in the government’s policing of Microsoft, in which an expert committee was created to oversee some practices and look into complaints on case-by-case.  “They were all over whatever Microsoft was doing,” said Gary Reback, an antitrust attorney who was involved in the Microsoft case and now represents clients opposed to Google.  A similar committee could provide an effective way to look into complaints of favoritism in Google’s search algorithm, Reback said.

29,IBM,State Street announces more layoffs,"BOSTON (Reuters) - State Street Corp (STT.N), one of the world’s biggest institutional investors, said it would eliminate as many 850 jobs from its technology unit as it tries to curb costs.  The company said that 530 positions will be eliminated outright and another 320 technology jobs will be outsourced to IBM (IBM.N) and Wipro Technologies (WIT.N).  Most of the job cuts will occur in North America.  This is the second time in less than a year that State Street announced job cuts. In November the company said it would eliminate 1,400 positions by the end of this year. The company employs 4,000 people in its technology department worldwide.  The announcement came on the same day that State Street reported higher quarterly earnings but also said that its expenses had ticked higher. On an operating basis, expenses climbed 20 percent, fueled by a 22 percent jump in salaries and employee benefits.  The company’s share price was down 2.8 percent, or $1.16, at $41.79 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  State Street will take a charge of as much as $130 million in the second half of 2011 to pay for the job cuts. The total restructuring costs will result in charges of between $400 million and $450 million over four years, the company said.

31,IBM,Ex-trader Chiesi awaits fate in Galleon insider case,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - “There is not even a chance we will do one day in jail,” Danielle Chiesi declared early last year in an interview with Reuters.  On Wednesday, the former high-school beauty queen and hedge fund trader is expected to learn how many days — or years — she will in fact spend behind bars for insider trading.  Chiesi, 45, pleaded guilty in January to three conspiracy counts. She is the first major defendant to be sentenced in the government insider-trading probe, unveiled in October 2009 and centered on Galleon Group hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam.  Prosecutors have called Chiesi the “consummate Wall Street insider.” They said the former trader at New Castle Funds, a now-closed New York hedge fund that was once part of Bear Stearns Cos, schmoozed powerful sources to get inside tips about corporate activity and tried to hide her tracks.  Not true, Chiesi’s lawyers said in court papers arguing for leniency. They called her an emotionally scarred victim of a gnarled love affair with her former boss. “Dani,” they said, had an unhealthy desire to please and to avoid rejection.  “The question is whether the mitigating factors were much more severe or pronounced than what a typical defendant would have,” said Stanley Twardy, a partner at Day Pitney and a former U.S. attorney in Connecticut. “Courts do not typically give great weight to a failed relationship in deciding whether to lower a sentence.”  U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell in Manhattan will impose Chiesi’s sentence.  Prosecutors recommended a 37- to 46-month prison term, reflecting federal guidelines that Holwell need not follow.  Chiesi is seeking fewer than 27 months, the punishment that the former boss, Mark Kurland, got for his guilty plea from a different judge. Last week, she agreed to a $540,535 settlement of a related Securities and Exchange Commission civil probe.  Holwell has leeway in sentencing to consider such factors as Chiesi’s mental state, her motivations, and the pressures she faced, said Mark Rankin, co-chairman of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.  “Given that her boss got 27 months I could see the judge at least sentencing her below the guidelines range,” said Rankin, who is also a partner at Shutts & Bowen in Tampa, Florida.  Chiesi is one of just two women among the 26 people charged criminally in the Galleon probe.  Twenty-one pleaded guilty, including the other woman, Roomy Khan. Four were convicted at trial. One is missing.  At her January plea hearing, Chiesi tearfully admitted to “crossing the line” by leaking tips about companies such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.N and International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N).  Recorded telephone calls, some risque, played at Rajaratnam’s trial had shown Chiesi gloating that getting inside tips was a “conquest.” Prosecutors contended she made $4 million from insider trading.  But her lawyers maintained she never paid or was paid for tips and never traded in her own account.  Chiesi has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and “greed and venality” did not drive her actions, her lawyers said. Indeed, it was her relationships with men that were a much bigger factor, they said.  Among these men: former IBM executive Robert Moffat, who pleaded guilty in the case and was freed from prison on May 3.  Another was Kurland, her lover for nearly 20 years and who Chiesi’s lawyers said exploited her as his “virtual servant.”  The fates of other defendants could guide Holwell in sentencing Chiesi, said Jeff Ifrah, co-author of the book “Federal Sentencing for Business Crimes.”  “A judge could look at how Chiesi compares to similarly situated co-defendants and slot her based on the egregiousness of her conduct,” Ifrah said. “One factor is how much personal financial gain there was. Rajaratnam is at the top of that list while Chiesi is at the bottom.”  Holwell’s actions could also hint at the type of punishment he might mete out for Rajaratnam, lawyers said.  Still, Rajaratnam’s larger crime and refusal to settle will result in a far harsher penalty, they added.  A jury convicted Rajaratnam on May 11 on 14 counts related to insider trading, which prosecutors said led to $63.8 million of illegal gains. He could face up to 19-1/2 years in prison under federal guidelines. His sentencing is set for September 27.  Holwell’s “manner and tone” in describing Chiesi’s behavior could be a harbinger for Rajaratnam, Twardy said.  “If he suggests that people were really hurt, then he might come down hard,” he said. “If he suggests the conduct was typical Wall Street conduct, it might signal he would not be as tough.”  The case is U.S. v. Chiesi, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 09-01184.

32,IBM,"Intel pulls back PC market outlook, shares slide","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp trimmed its forecast for 2011 personal computer unit sales, warning of softness in mature markets and sending its shares more than 1 percent lower.  The top maker of microprocessors for PCs now expects 8 to 10 percent growth in unit shipments of computers this year, down from the low double-digits it had stuck to earlier in defiance of fears that market momentum was decelerating.  Intel’s processors are used in 80 percent of the world’s computers, but mobile devices from Apple Inc’s iPad to Google Inc Android smartphones are eating into PC sales and Intel is struggling to gain a foothold in the fast-expanding mobile market.  Its Atom division, which caters to a mobile computing market, saw revenue slide 15 percent to $352 million.  “The mature market consumer segment is still soft, but the emerging market consumer segment is healthy and growing,” CEO Paul Otellini told analysts on a conference call.  Doubts about high U.S. unemployment, the risk of a European financial crisis, climbing inventories and sluggish PC sales had clouded the second-half outlook for Intel and other chip makers like Advanced Micro Devices.  The tepid forecast and lingering concerns about the second half overshadowed a solid quarter for the chip giant. Its quarterly results and revenue forecast both trumped Wall Street’s expectations.  Gains in the second quarter were driven by the PC group, Intel’s largest segment, and the data center group, which has been expanding quickly in part because of cloud computing.  Intel’s upbeat results followed positive quarterly earnings from Apple and International Business Machines Corp earlier this week.  The company foresaw current-quarter revenue of about $14 billion, give or take $500 million, versus the $13.5 billion analysts expect on average.  “When we look across the broader worldwide supply chain for PCs and servers, what we see are inventory levels that are lean out there. People are managing things lean, they’re prudent,” Intel Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith told Reuters.  Investors eyeing slow economies and red-hot sales of Apple’s iPad 2 in recent months have insisted Intel’s outlook for PC growth is overly optimistic. Analysts had warned that Intel at some point may be forced to trim its estimate.  “The primary question investors are going to ask now is where Intel is seeing the fundamental strength in the PC market,” said Evercore Partners analyst Patrick Wang. “It’s hard to have any confidence in how they are going to deliver 7 percent growth sequentially.”  Analysts on average had expected Intel’s revenue to rise to $13.5 billion in the current quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, less than normal growth for this time of year.  Revenue in the June quarter was $13.1 billion, up 22 percent over the year-ago period and above the $12.8 billion expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Non-GAAP net income in the quarter was $3.2 billion, up 10 percent. Non-GAAP earnings per share were 59 cents, beating expectations of 51 cents.  Shares of Intel dipped 1.52 percent to $22.64 in extended trade after closing down 0.3 percent.

34,IBM,Chiesi gets 2-1/2 years prison in insider case,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Danielle Chiesi, a former hedge fund trader and key defendant in the sprawling Galleon Group insider trading case, was sentenced on Wednesday to 2-1/2 years in prison, and the presiding judge gave a stern warning to others on Wall Street considering breaking the law.  Chiesi, 45, is the first major defendant to be sentenced in the government’s probe, unveiled in October 2009 and centered on Raj Rajaratnam, founder of the Galleon hedge fund.  “The message to Wall Street needs to be loud and clear: If you trade on inside information, you will be caught; if convicted, you will be sentenced to prison,” U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell in Manhattan said after imposing the sentence.  Rajaratnam, a one-time billionaire, was convicted on May 11, and faces a September 27 sentencing, also by Holwell.  Wearing a pale pink sleeveless silk dress, matching shoes and a pearl necklace, Chiesi, a former high school beauty queen, spoke briefly to the judge before being sentenced. She pleaded guilty in January to three conspiracy counts.  “I know there is a punishment for people who do wrong ... but it won’t happen again,” Chiesi, choking up, said in a whisper. She was ordered to report to prison on September 20.  Chiesi was also sentenced to two years of supervised release, 250 hours of community service and a $25,000 fine. Earlier this month, she agreed to a $540,535 settlement of a related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil probe. Chiesi did not cooperate with prosecutors.  The prison term is shorter than the 37 to 46 months prosecutors sought, but longer than the 27 months Chiesi’s former boss at New Castle Funds, Mark Kurland, received in May 2010 for his guilty plea to insider trading. Chiesi’s lawyers said their client deserved less time than Kurland.  Holwell said community service is a “healthy substitute” for more prison, and gives Chiesi “an opportunity to adjust her moral compass, which obviously fell by the wayside.”  After being sentenced, Chiesi was seen in the courtroom laughing as she shook hands with prosecutors and with an FBI agent who testified against Rajaratnam at his trial.  The laughter continued outside the courthouse, as Chiesi told reporters: “I told the FBI agent if they’re ever going to knock on my door again, do it in the afternoon.”  She was arrested on the same day as Rajaratnam, in an early morning takedown at her Manhattan apartment.  Rajaratnam was convicted on 14 counts related to insider trading, which prosecutors said resulted in $63.8 million of gains. He could get 19-1/2 years in prison under federal guidelines.  “There is nothing meaningful that Rajaratnam can do to mitigate his sentence,” said Jacob Frenkel, a partner at Shulman, Rogers, Gandal, Pordy & Ecker in Rockville, Maryland and former federal prosecutor. “Even if he were to fall on his sword and tell all to the government, he wouldn’t get much credit, because he went to trial.”  A spokesman for Rajaratnam declined to comment.  Roughly 50 people have been charged in the insider trading probe. Of the 26 charged criminally in the Galleon portion, 25 were convicted or pleaded guilty, and one is missing. All but two, Chiesi and former Galleon employee Roomy Khan, are men.  Prosecutors called Chiesi the “consummate Wall Street insider.” They said she would use her charm and physical appeal to talk up powerful sources and then get and leak inside tips.  Companies such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc, Akamai Technologies Inc and International Business Machines Corp were the subject of several tips, and Chiesi made $4 million from insider trading, prosecutors said.  Recorded phone calls played at Rajaratnam’s trial showed Chiesi gloating that getting inside tips was a “conquest,” and that she once played a supposed Akamai source “like a finely tuned piano” to learn about that company’s outlook.  Chiesi’s lawyers called her a needy, emotionally scarred victim of a nearly 20-year relationship with Kurland. They said she never paid or was paid for tips, or traded in her account.  But prosecutor Andrew Michaelson countered that Chiesi was more than just a “pawn” for Kurland. “Chiesi played a central and starring role in her crimes,” Michaelson said. “She forged her relationships, she initiated her criminal conduct.”  Alan Kaufman, Chiesi’s lawyer, said after the sentencing that his client is “glad that the uncertainty is now over” and plans to move on with her life after completing her prison term.

Recorded phone calls played at Rajaratnam’s trial showed Chiesi gloating that getting inside tips was a “conquest,” and that she once played a supposed Akamai source “like a finely tuned piano” to learn about that company’s outlook.   Chiesi’s lawyers called her a needy, emotionally scarred victim of a nearly 20-year relationship with Kurland. They said she never paid or was paid for tips, or traded in her account.   But prosecutor Andrew Michaelson countered that Chiesi was more than just a “pawn” for Kurland. “Chiesi played a central and starring role in her crimes,” Michaelson said. “She forged her relationships, she initiated her criminal conduct.”   Alan Kaufman, Chiesi’s lawyer, said after the sentencing that his client is “glad that the uncertainty is now over” and plans to move on with her life after completing her prison term.   The case is U.S. v. Chiesi, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 09-01184.  (Editing by Martha Graybow, Gerald E.

36,IBM,Exclusive: Google offers credit card to advertisers,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google Inc is introducing a credit card for its advertising customers, offering its clients a credit line to try and drum up business as competition in the online ad market heats up.  Google is offering the card to select U.S. clients with what it calls a competitive interest rate, an ample credit line and no annual fee. The catch: it can only be used to buy search advertising on the world’s No.1 Internet search engine.  The AdWords Business credit card marks Google’s first foray into the world of vendor financing, common among hardware makers such as IBM Corp. It lets marketers spend more on its search ads when the need arises.  Claire Johnson, vice president of global online sales at Google, said the credit card was designed to help small and medium-sized businesses that advertise on Google but who often don’t have the funds to support a heavy ad campaign ahead of a big sales season, such as Valentine’s day or Halloween.  “They are resource-constrained and they are often cash flow-strapped. Many of them are trying to grow a business without the kind of means that, say, your classic company has,” she said.  Consumer-oriented companies like Macy’s Inc and Amazon.com Inc have offered credit cards for years to drive purchases, inspire customer loyalty and track spending habits. Some retailers that own their own credit card operations, like Nordstrom Inc can also earn some interest income.  Google will email invitations offering the credit card to some of its customers on Wednesday. The card will initially be available as a “beta” test, available to select users.  Google makes 96 percent of its revenue from advertising, the vast majority of which comes from the small ads that appear alongside its search results, known as AdWords. But its business faces rising competition from a search alliance between Microsoft Corp and Yahoo Inc, as well as from social networking service Facebook, which is becoming popular with small and large advertisers alike.  The AdWords card is a MasterCard that will be issued through the World Financial Capital Bank. The card’s 8.99 percent annual percentage rate is the ongoing rate, and not an introductory rate, Google said.  Google is keeping quiet on many of the other details, including the minimum and maximum credit lines available (Google says it will vary by cardholder) and the number of people to whom the card will be offered.  Brent Callinicos, Google’s Treasurer, said that the credit card will be offered to a “statistically significant” number of people as Google examines the results of how availability of the card affects customer spending behavior.  “Even though (availability) will skew toward the smaller businesses, obviously we want to cast a wide enough net so we can see what resonates depending on your historical monthly spend,” said Callinicos.  Google will evaluate customers’ creditworthiness through a combination of internal efforts and with the help of a financial partner, he said.  The effort to offer a credit card comes as Google’s cash pile continues to grow, reaching $39.1 billion in cash and marketable securities as of June 30. Google does not pay a dividend or participate in any ongoing share repurchase program.  “Obviously we have a robust balance sheet, so this is a way for us to use that balance sheet to help our customers,” Callinicos said.  But he stressed that the main motive for the card was to provide loans to Google customers in an economic environment in which getting credit can be tough.  “It isn’t a financial engineering project that we came up with and said this would be cool to do. It’s a customer need,” he said.  One popular perk missing from Google’s credit card is the ability to rack up airline miles with purchases. But Callinicos said he did not think the omission will hurt the card’s appeal.  “I think if you had the choice of an 18 percent credit card and miles versus an 8.99 percent credit card and no miles, it’s a pretty easy choice,” he said.

37,IBM,How to play it: Apple surges after stellar results,"NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Apple Inc’s stellar quarterly results trounced Wall Street expectations and sent the company’s shares up more than 5 percent on Wednesday. The iPhone maker said revenue nearly doubled in its fiscal third quarter.  The question: What’s the best way to take advantage of Apple’s climb and is there any downside?  The number one way to benefit from Apple’s momentum is to buy the company’s shares and hold onto them for at least two years, said Steve Coleman, a portfolio manager with Daedalus Capital who has owned Apple stock for seven years.  “It’s dirt cheap and its prospects are fabulous,” Coleman said. “I think it’s its own asset class and its own store of value.”  Apple shares’ record high of $396.27 hit on Wednesday marked a more than 20 percent gain from the start of the year and a more than 50 percent rise from a year ago to date. But given the high profile of Apple and company CEO Steve Jobs — who has been on leave since January for undisclosed medical reasons — the stock is also susceptible to short-term market swings.  “If something happens to Steve Jobs tomorrow, the stock may go down 50 bucks, so you have to be careful and have it in moderation,” said Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management, who recommends starting with a 5 percent position. “There are always things that could trip them up.”  The stock has also benefited from the bullish sentiment in the tech sector after International Business Machines Corp, a bellwether for the industry, delivered strong earnings earlier this week. The S&P information technology index jumped 2.7 percent, the best performing sector, on Tuesday.  Ticonderoga Securities raised its 12-month price target for Apple to $666 from $612 on Wednesday, citing the combination of Apple’s inexpensive valuation and momentum.  While suppliers may benefit down the line from Apple’s business growth, many of these companies are not necessarily known because Apple makes it a point not to disclose names.  As a consequence, there is not as much certainty over to what extent Apple suppliers are poised to benefit from Apple’s profit climb. Even among the known suppliers, their stock will not necessarily jump in tandem with Apple’s because of additional factors like individual company earnings or announcements.  Cirrus Logic and OmniVision Technologies are two Apple suppliers that have benefited from Apple’s upswing. Cirrus shares closed up 4.4 percent on Wednesday, while OmniVision shares rose 3.3 percent.  “The suppliers will definitely benefit,” said Bradshaw, who owns both Cirrus and OmniVision and calls them “top positions.”  Among other known Apple providers, shares of semiconductor provider Marvell fell 0.7 percent on Wednesday, while digital wireless product maker Qualcomm shares were up 0.6 percent and chip maker Intel Corp shares were down 0.3 percent. APPLE OPTIONS  Apple shares have been a winning bet for a long time but with the stock nearing $400 some option strategists suggest investors could look to minimize their risk by betting on more gains, only not exorbitant ones.  Assuming a stock will only rally a little bit is not normal for someone who only invests in stocks. But for investors who use the options market, it’s a common occurrence, says Steve Place, a founder of options analytics firm InvestingWithOptions in Mobile, Alabama.  The way to put on trades like this is not easy — it takes a bit of knowledge about how options work. Unlike a stock, options have other components that influence pricing, one of which is time decay — an erosion of the options premium as it nears expiration.  One trade suggested by Place is a so-called “iron butterfly” strategy. He recommends the September Apple options contracts to implement this strategy. The iron butterfly is a short volatility bet and has a limited risk, limited reward that makes money if the stock stays around a certain price of the investor’s choosing, said Place.  This trade involves selling a straddle — that is, selling a put option and a call option at the same strike price and expiration date. For instance, selling a call at a $400 strike price and selling a put with the same strike price — that is a bet against volatility.  The next step is to buy a “strangle,” which involves buying a call and a put with two different strike prices — both out-of-the-money — with the same expiration date.  Adding a strangle would limit the risk of a strong move in the underlying shares. The bet makes money if the stock remains close to the strike price of the straddle — such as $400.

The results failed to excite a market already wary about growth prospects for the company and PC industry as netbook sales give way to tablets. The stock was flat in after-hours trading.   “All eyes are on Windows and how they are ultimately going to extend this franchise in the future, as the PC business continues to lose share to the tablets,” said Josh Olson, technology analyst at money manager Edward Jones. “Microsoft is really a show-me story in terms of its ability to extend its core flagship products to these new growth platforms.”   On Wednesday, chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) warned that PC sales will not be as strong as it had expected this year. [ID:nN1E76I25R]   Microsoft is expected to enter the tablet market in earnest next year with the launch of its next operating system — code-named Windows 8 — which will be compatible with the low-power chips designed by ARM Holdings ARM.L favored by tablet and mobile phone makers.   Despite the Windows dip, Microsoft managed to ease past Wall Street’s earnings estimates, helped by strong sales of its Office software and Xbox game console, as well as a dramatic drop in its tax bill.   The world’s largest software maker follows Google Inc (GOOG.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) in reporting surprisingly good results as technology spending holds up relatively well in an uncertain economy.   The Redmond, Washington-based company on Thursday posted net profit of $5.87 billion, or 69 cents per share, up from $4.52 billion, or 51 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.   That easily beat Wall Street’s average estimate of 58 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Microsoft has beaten the average profit estimate for each of the last nine quarters.   Microsoft was helped by an unusually low tax rate of 7 percent in the quarter, which cut its tax bill by more than $1 billion from the year before, to $445 million. The company, which gets most of its revenue from overseas, said the savings were due to a one-time tax gain and more business flowing through its regional centers in the low-tax jurisdictions of Ireland, Singapore and Puerto Rico.   Sales rose 8 percent to $17.37 billion, ahead of analysts’ average estimate of $17.23 billion, boosted chiefly by sales of Office, Xbox and server software behind Microsoft’s push into Internet-centric, or “cloud” computing.   Microsoft shares fluctuated after the results were announced in after-hours trading, settling close to their closing price of $27.09 on Nasdaq. The stock is up 8 percent over the past 12 months, compared to a 30 percent rise in the Nasdaq composite index .IXIC. The shares are stuck at a level first hit in 1998, adjusted for stock splits.   “These numbers are good. The question is, what will make Microsoft break this range in which it is stuck, between $25 and $28?” said Trip Chowdhry, managing director at Global Equities Research. “I don’t see these numbers giving an indication that the stock is going to break away.”   Spending by businesses on technology has generally outstripped cash-strapped consumers since the worldwide economic downturn.   Microsoft’s business division, which last month rolled out online versions of its popular Office suite of programs such as Outlook, SharePoint and Excel, was the company’s biggest seller in the quarter, racking up a 7 percent increase in sales to $5.8 billion.   The server and tools business, which sells software used by datacenters — an essential building block of cloud computing — posted a 12 percent increase in sales to $4.6 billion.   The entertainment and devices unit, which sells the company’s video game and phone products, posted a 30 percent increase in sales to $1.5 billion, mostly due to the popularity of the Xbox and the new hands-free gaming Kinect add-on.   Sales at the Windows unit fell 0.8 percent to $4.7 billion. PC sales grew only 2.3 percent in the second quarter, according to tech research firm Gartner, well below earlier projections, as economic uncertainty hangs over consumers and Apple’s iPad and other tablets eat into the market.   Microsoft’s perennial money-losing online services unit, which runs the Bing search engine and MSN Internet portal, posted a 16.5 percent increase in sales to $662 million, but its loss widened to $728 million from a loss of $688 million a year ago, as Microsoft continues to pour money into attacking Google.

43,IBM,"Microsoft profit beats Street, Windows fizzle","SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp eased past Wall Street’s earnings estimates, helped by strong sales of its Office software and Xbox game console and an unusually low tax rate.

44,IBM,Intel backs off PC market outlook,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp trimmed its forecast for 2011 personal computer unit sales, warning of softness in mature markets and sending its shares down more than 1 percent even as its revenue outlook beat estimates.  The top maker of microprocessors for PCs now expects 8 to 10 percent growth in unit shipments of computers this year, down from the low double-digits it had stuck to earlier in defiance of fears that market momentum was decelerating.  Intel’s processors are used in 80 percent of the world’s PCs, but mobile devices from Apple Inc’s iPad to Google Inc Android smartphones are eating into laptop sales and Intel is struggling to gain a foothold in the fast-expanding mobile market.  Its Atom division, which caters to a mobile computing market, saw revenue slide 15 percent to $352 million.  “The mature market consumer segment is still soft, but the emerging-market consumer segment is healthy and growing,” CEO Paul Otellini told analysts on a conference call.  Intel’s tepid PC forecast and concerns about the economy overshadowed a solid quarter for the chip giant, with quarterly results and revenue forecast both trumping Wall Street’s expectations.  The Santa Clara, California expects average selling prices for its chips to increase as families in China and other emerging markets that buying their first ever-computers choose fairly high-quality PCs that are built to last.  Intel’s upbeat results followed positive quarterly earnings from Apple and International Business Machines Corp earlier this week.  But doubts about high U.S. unemployment, the risk of a European financial crisis, climbing inventories and sluggish PC sales weighed on sentiment — and share prices — of Intel and other chip makers.  Mobile chipmaker Qualcomm raised its quarterly outlook on Wednesday but investors jumpy about the economy sent its shares 3 percent lower after hours. [nN1E76J250] Also, Xilinx and Freescale saw their shares fall despite beating estimates.  “It does happen that semiconductor companies are further back in the supply chain and they don’t see the end-user demand. They just see the orders coming from their customers and sometimes they can be surprised,” said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy.  Intel’s gains in the second quarter were driven by the PC group, its largest segment, and the data center group, which has been expanding quickly in part because of cloud computing.  Chief Executive Paul Otellini said he is confident tablets will not replace small laptop computers, even after Apple’s blockbuster iPad sales in the second quarter.

45,IBM,"CORRECTED-UPDATE 6-Intel backs off PC market outlook, shares dip"," (Adds Q2 EPS number in next to last paragraph to reflect a more suitable comparison)   * Intel lowers PC market forecast   * Overshadows results, outlook   * Stock lower after hours  (Adds detail on other chipmakers, quote)   By Noel Randewich   SAN FRANCISCO, July 20 (Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) trimmed its forecast for 2011 personal computer unit sales, warning of softness in mature markets and sending its shares down more than 1 percent even as its revenue outlook beat estimates.   The top maker of microprocessors for PCs now expects 8 to 10 percent growth in unit shipments of computers this year, down from the low double-digits it had stuck to earlier in defiance of fears that market momentum was decelerating.   Intel’s processors are used in 80 percent of the world’s PCs, but mobile devices from Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) iPad to Google Inc (GOOG.O) Android smartphones are eating into laptop sales and Intel is struggling to gain a foothold in the fast-expanding mobile market.   Its Atom division, which caters to a mobile computing market, saw revenue slide 15 percent to $352 million.   “The mature market consumer segment is still soft, but the emerging-market consumer segment is healthy and growing,” CEO Paul Otellini told analysts on a conference call.   Intel’s tepid PC forecast and concerns about the economy overshadowed a solid quarter for the chip giant, with quarterly results and revenue forecast both trumping Wall Street’s expectations.   The Santa Clara, California expects average selling prices for its chips to increase as families in China and other emerging markets that buying their first ever-computers choose fairly high-quality PCs that are built to last.   Intel’s upbeat results followed positive quarterly earnings from Apple and International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) earlier this week.   But doubts about high U.S. unemployment, the risk of a European financial crisis, climbing inventories and sluggish PC sales weighed on sentiment — and share prices — of Intel and other chip makers.   Mobile chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM.O) raised its quarterly outlook on Wedensday but investors jumpy about the economy sent its shares 3 percent lower after hours. [nN1E76J250] Also, Xilinx (XLNX.O) and Freescale FSL.N saw their shares fall despite beating estimates.   “It does happen that semiconductor companies are further back in the supply chain and they don’t see the end-user demand. They just see the orders coming from their customers and sometimes they can be surprised,” said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy.   Intel’s gains in the second quarter were driven by the PC group, its largest segment, and the data center group, which has been expanding quickly in part because of cloud computing.   Chief Executive Paul Otellini said he is confident tablets will not replace small laptop computers, even after Apple’s blockbuster iPad sales in the second quarter.   He said Intel, which has failed so far to gain traction in mobile gadgets, will be “hyper competitive” winning space for its processors in tablets using an upcoming version of Microsoft’s (MSFT.O) Windows operating system.   The company foresaw current-quarter revenue of about $14 billion, give or take $500 million, versus the $13.5 billion analysts expect on average.   “When we look across the broader worldwide supply chain for PCs and servers, what we see are inventory levels that are lean out there.

46,IBM,Exclusive: Google offers credit card to advertisers,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google Inc is introducing a credit card for its advertising customers, offering its clients a credit line to try and drum up business as competition in the online ad market heats up.  Google is offering the card to select U.S. clients with what it calls a competitive interest rate, an ample credit line and no annual fee. The catch: it can only be used to buy search advertising on the world’s No.1 Internet search engine.  The AdWords Business credit card marks Google’s first foray into the world of vendor financing, common among hardware makers such as IBM Corp. It lets marketers spend more on its search ads when the need arises.  Claire Johnson, vice president of global online sales at Google, said the credit card was designed to help small and medium-sized businesses that advertise on Google but who often don’t have the funds to support a heavy ad campaign ahead of a big sales season, such as Valentine’s day or Halloween.  “They are resource-constrained and they are often cash flow-strapped. Many of them are trying to grow a business without the kind of means that, say, your classic company has,” she said.  Consumer-oriented companies like Macy’s Inc and Amazon.com Inc have offered credit cards for years to drive purchases, inspire customer loyalty and track spending habits. Some retailers that own their own credit card operations, like Nordstrom Inc can also earn some interest income.  Google will email invitations offering the credit card to some of its customers on Wednesday. The card will initially be available as a “beta” test, available to select users.  Google makes 96 percent of its revenue from advertising, the vast majority of which comes from the small ads that appear alongside its search results, known as AdWords. But its business faces rising competition from a search alliance between Microsoft Corp and Yahoo Inc, as well as from social networking service Facebook, which is becoming popular with small and large advertisers alike.  The AdWords card is a MasterCard that will be issued through the World Financial Capital Bank. The card’s 8.99 percent annual percentage rate is the ongoing rate, and not an introductory rate, Google said.  Google is keeping quiet on many of the other details, including the minimum and maximum credit lines available (Google says it will vary by cardholder) and the number of people to whom the card will be offered.  Brent Callinicos, Google’s Treasurer, said that the credit card will be offered to a “statistically significant” number of people as Google examines the results of how availability of the card affects customer spending behavior.  “Even though (availability) will skew toward the smaller businesses, obviously we want to cast a wide enough net so we can see what resonates depending on your historical monthly spend,” said Callinicos.  Google will evaluate customers’ creditworthiness through a combination of internal efforts and with the help of a financial partner, he said.  The effort to offer a credit card comes as Google’s cash pile continues to grow, reaching $39.1 billion in cash and marketable securities as of June 30. Google does not pay a dividend or participate in any ongoing share repurchase program.  “Obviously we have a robust balance sheet, so this is a way for us to use that balance sheet to help our customers,” Callinicos said.  But he stressed that the main motive for the card was to provide loans to Google customers in an economic environment in which getting credit can be tough.  “It isn’t a financial engineering project that we came up with and said this would be cool to do. It’s a customer need,” he said.  One popular perk missing from Google’s credit card is the ability to rack up airline miles with purchases. But Callinicos said he did not think the omission will hurt the card’s appeal.  “I think if you had the choice of an 18 percent credit card and miles versus an 8.99 percent credit card and no miles, it’s a pretty easy choice,” he said.

47,IBM,Microsoft profit set to rise but PC worries dominate," * Fiscal Q4 EPS expected $0.58 vs year ago $0.51   * Sales seen up 7 pct to $17.23 bln   * Follows strong results from Apple, IBM, Intel   * Concerns linger over strength of PC market    By Bill Rigby	   SEATTLE, July 21 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is expected to post a 9 percent increase in fiscal fourth-quarter profit on Thursday, helped by solid sales of its Windows and Office mainstays, but investors may be distracted by evidence of flickering computer sales, which are key to its success.	   The world’s largest software maker is set to follow Google Inc , Apple Inc , and IBM in reporting surprisingly good results as technology spending holds up relatively well in an uncertain economy.	   But the latest signs from chipmaker Intel Corp on Wednesday that PC growth will not be as strong as it expected this year cast doubt on how long Microsoft’s strong performance can continue.	   “The mature market consumer segment is still soft,” Intel Chief Executive Paul Otellini told analysts on a conference call on Wednesday, after the company cut its 2011 PC growth projection to a range of 8 percent to 10 percent from earlier estimates in the low double digits. 	   Even that could be optimistic. PC sales grew only 2.3 percent last quarter, according to research firm Gartner, as cash-strapped consumers held off buying or opted for an iPad instead.	   The number of PCs sold — 90 percent of which come pre-loaded with Windows — directly affects Microsoft’s top and bottom line.	   There are already signs that sales of its popular Windows 7 operating system are leveling off. Microsoft said last week it has now sold more than 400 million Windows 7 licenses since launch in October 2009, up from 350 million three months ago. That suggests 50 million Windows sales in the quarter, about the number it sold the quarter before that.	   Windows 7 has already become old news for investors eyeing ‘Windows 8’ — the provisional name for the next tablet-friendly operating system expected late next year.	 	   LONG-TERM MODERATION	   Wall Street analysts expect Microsoft to post a profit of 58 cents per share for the quarter, up from 51 cents a year ago, while sales are expected to rise 7 pct to $17.23 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.	   Microsoft’s revenue and profit have recently slipped behind archrival Apple, which had more than $28 billion of sales last quarter, helped by its explosively popular iPhone and iPad.	   (For an interactive graphic comparing major tech firms, click on r.reuters.com/nuw62s)	   Microsoft has seen its growth moderate since it rose to dominance in the 1990s. Its sales grew 12-fold between 1991 and 2000, whereas they grew by only two and a half times between 2001 and 2010.	   “There’s just not enough growth there to make people interested,” said Michael Yoshikami, Chief Executive of fund manager YCMNET Advisors, earlier this week. “It’s the Johnson & Johnson of technology. A large, cash flow-oriented company, but explosive growth has probably passed it by the wayside.”	   Microsoft shares have outpaced the tech-heavy Nasdaq over the past month, but still are perched around $27, a level they have circled since 1998, adjusted for splits.

TORONTO, July 22 (Reuters) - Celestica Inc (CLS.TO) (CLS.N) said on Friday its quarterly profit more than tripled as new business awards pushed revenue higher, and shares of the contract electronics manufacturer rose as much as 10 percent.   Profit rose to $45.7 million, or 21 cents a share, in the second quarter, compared with $13 million, or 6 cents a share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis it earned 27 cents per share.   “New business awards from 2010 are contributing to our revenue growth and operating margins are benefiting from a favorable revenue mix and higher operating efficiencies from recently ramped programs,” Chief Executive Craig Muhlhauser said in a release.   The company expects sales of $1.8 billion in the current quarter, give or take $75 million, and adjusted net earnings between 23 cents to 29 cents a share.   The Canadian-based company said an uncertain global economic climate was continuing to have an impact on customer demand.   Revenue for the company, whose top customers include IBM (IBM.N) and Cisco (CSCO.O), rose to $1.83 billion from $1.59 billion in the year earlier.   Chief Financial Officer Paul Nicoletti said during a conference call that the company will meet its target of 10 to 15 percent revenue growth in 2011.   But Celestica completed its acquisition of a contract manufacturing unit from Brooks Automation (BRKS.O) in the second quarter, and that unit’s contribution to revenue had not been included in the original target.   “One of our largest customers has commented that overall they do expect volumes to be down, so it’s safe to say that we are seeing an impact there,” said Nicoletti, without specifying the customer.   The company’s shares hit a two-year low in June after Research In Motion, RIM.TO one major customer, reported disappointing results and provided a dismal outlook.   First-quarter earnings reflected smaller-than-expected orders from Oracle, whose purchase of Sun Microsystems last year brought new server business to Celestica.   Celestica shares rose 14.1 percent early on Thursday to C$9.17 on the Toronto Stock Exchange and 13.3 percent to $9.65 on the New York Stock Exchange.

It also is boosting sales growth to a range of 3 percent to 5 percent a year, Barron’s wrote.  However, one source of income, U.S. government spending, is waning.

54,IBM,Analysis: Doubts emerge over U.S. move to global accounting,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Once thought inevitable, a decisive move by the United States to one-world accounting is now in serious doubt.  Blame delays, shifting timelines, or huge debt and high unemployment problems in the United States’ own back yard, but the idea of a massive change in companies’ accounting framework is not the crowd-pleaser it once was.  “If there was a compelling value proposition that said, ‘as a policy, this is the right thing to do,’ it would be going faster than it’s going,” said Steven Nielsen, chief executive officer of Dycom Industries.  At issue are U.S. generally accepted accounting principles in use since the 1930s, known as GAAP, and whether to phase them out in favor of international financial reporting standards, known as IFRS and set by the London-based International Accounting Standards Board.  In theory, switching to international standards would make it easier for investors to compare U.S. businesses to others around the globe, reducing companies’ cost of capital. Big multinational firms like Ford and IBM, which use IFRS for their businesses overseas, would no longer have to keep separate books to report in the United States.  The stakes go beyond individual standards. A bigger debate is whether the United States, or any country, should cede control over standard-setting and join a regime with no workable plan yet for uniform global enforcement.  “It’s a move away from innovation and progress,” said Paul Miller, an accounting professor at the University of Colorado. Though he often disagrees with the U.S. standard-setting board, “it’s the best of them all, so why would anyone want to pull all of its teeth?”  U.S. rule-makers have been working since 2002 to bring the country’s standards more into line with international rules. Now that the two regimes are closer, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has said it will decide by the end of the year whether to switch to IFRS.  A wholesale switch looks increasingly unlikely. In a staff paper in May, the SEC noted that very few countries adopted IFRS automatically without the right to approve the standards first, sometimes tailoring them to their own needs.  In the European Union, for example, any new or amended IASB standards go through several steps before taking effect there, the SEC noted.  The SEC also has voiced concerns about costs to small companies that have no overseas operations and would benefit little from global rules.  Andy Bishop, chief financial officer at Hallador Energy Co, said he had not heard investors clamoring for IFRS.  “U.S. GAAP is the gold standard of the world,” he said. “If it’s not broken, why fix it?”  One idea outlined in the SEC’s staff paper would be to let the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board review IFRS standards before deciding whether to endorse them. U.S. GAAP would remain in effect, and IFRS would be incorporated into that framework, a process the SEC said could take five to seven years.  “This is a journey and everything doesn’t change at once,” said Sandra Peters, head of the financial reporting policy group at CFA Institute. “If we can continue to improve accounting standards in incremental steps, then over time we’re going to get a better answer.”  Some are questioning whether the payoff is worth the effort if all the United States did was to adopt its own version of IFRS.  “The objective was to have one set of global standards all around the world,” said Jack Ciesielski, publisher of The Analyst’s Accounting Observer.  That now seems unrealistic, he said, with less than 16 percent of the world’s markets using a pure version of IFRS as published by IASB.  A number of GAAP standards serve U.S. purposes better than IFRS, Ciesielski said. GAAP, for example, has specialized revenue recognition accounting for casinos, airlines and other industries, while IFRS does not, he said. Rule-makers are revising that standard to align IFRS and GAAP.  Unlike IFRS, GAAP allows “last-in-first-out” inventory reporting, which produces more accurate income statements, he said. With last-in-first-out, or LIFO, companies can assume for cost accounting that their most recently acquired inventory, usually the most expensive, was sold first.  “The real agitators for IFRS are outside the United States,” including the IASB itself, Ciesielski said. Some larger firms with non-U.S. operations are in favor of the move, “but you don’t hear too many Midwestern agricultural concerns arguing for it,” he said.  Others argue that the compromise outlined by the SEC in May may be a good option.  “It’s a middle ground, and they’re probably looking for the best of both worlds,” said Olu Sonola, director of credit policy at Fitch. “The United States can be at the table as an active participant in global standard-setting, and also have the ability to control what becomes part of U.S. GAAP.”  Most observers agree the United States should continue eliminating needless differences between its accounting and the rest of the world’s.  “Every single country will never interpret things exactly the same, but you hope that at the time you’re working together, you’re getting closer,” said Lisa Filomia-Aktas, a partner at Ernst & Young.  What’s becoming apparent, though, is that diversity is not going to disappear.  “At least respect the differences in different markets, different countries, and needs of users in those countries and pay attention to that,” Ciesielski said. “I think that actually makes for more effective standard-setting than saying everybody’s the same when they’re not.”  ",7252011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-convergence/analysis-doubts-emerge-over-u-s-move-to-global-accounting-idUSTRE76O1N220110725
55,IBM,SAP raises outlook in defiance of weak Europe fears,"FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - Germany’s SAP AG (SAPG.DE) expects to reach the high end of its 2011 forecasts after a strong second quarter, confounding fears of a slowdown in economically fragile Europe and lifting its shares.  Echoing comments from peer IBM (IBM.N), the world’s biggest maker of business software said on Tuesday its visibility for the rest of the year had improved, raising hopes for a good year for the corporate technology sector.  SAP shares surged 6.9 percent in New York (SAP.N) by 1740 GMT (5:40 p.m. EDT) and closed up 6.1 percent on the Frankfurt stock exchange (SAPG.F).  Co-Chief Executive Jim Hagemann Snabe told journalists on a conference call SAP had won market share from all competitors in its core businesses thanks to new products that enable mobility, cloud computing and faster data retrieval.  Software sales grew strongly in all regions.  Addressing concerns about a debt crisis in Europe, Snabe said: “I see strong commitment from the main leaders in Europe to see that the euro is stable.” Snabe said he could not predict what effect a possible U.S. debt default would have on SAP.  Investors had feared that technology sales would slow in the second half, hurt by the economic uncertainty in Europe and Japan, as well as a drop in government spending.  SAP’s sales of software and related services, which are key to future lucrative maintenance revenue streams, grew 20 percent at constant currencies in the year to end-June, helped by growth in all regions, although Europe grew the least.  SAP said it now expected to reach the high end of its 10 to 14 percent growth 2011 forecast for software and related services, which were 9.87 billion euros ($14.3 billion) last year.  It also said it expected its 2011 operating profit to come in at the high end of the previously given range of between 4.45 billion euros and 4.65 billion, after operating profit grew 26 percent in the second quarter, raising its margin by 1.5 percentage points.  SAP bases its key outlook figures on non-international financial reporting standards, which exclude acquisition-related and other charges, saying it allows investors a better comparison of year-on-year operating performance.

Echoing comments from peer IBM (IBM.N), the world’s biggest maker of business software said on Tuesday its visibility for the rest of the year had improved, raising hopes for a good year for the corporate technology sector.   SAP shares surged 6.9 percent in New York (SAP.N) by 1740 GMT and closed up 6.1 percent on the Frankfurt stock exchange (SAPG.F).   Co-Chief Executive Jim Hagemann Snabe told journalists on a conference call SAP had won market share from all competitors in its core businesses thanks to new products that enable mobility, cloud computing and faster data retrieval.   Software sales grew strongly in all regions.   Addressing concerns about a debt crisis in Europe, Snabe said: “I see strong commitment from the main leaders in Europe to see that the euro is stable.” Snabe said he could not predict what effect a possible U.S. debt default would have on SAP.   Investors had feared that technology sales would slow in the second half, hurt by the economic uncertainty in Europe and Japan, as well as a drop in government spending. [ID:nN1E76H1DO]   SAP’s sales of software and related services, which are key to future lucrative maintenance revenue streams, grew 20 percent at constant currencies in the year to end-June, helped by growth in all regions, although Europe grew the least.   SAP said it now expected to reach the high end of its 10 to 14 percent growth 2011 forecast for software and related services, which were 9.87 billion euros ($14.3 billion) last year.   It also said it expected its 2011 operating profit to come in at the high end of the previously given range of between 4.45 billion euros and 4.65 billion, after operating profit grew 26 percent in the second quarter, raising its margin by 1.5 percentage points.   SAP bases its key outlook figures on non-international financial reporting standards, which exclude acquisition-related and other charges, saying it allows investors a better comparison of year-on-year operating performance.

60,IBM,"Lehman execs, auditor must defend investor lawsuit","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK executives, directors, auditors and underwriters lost their bid on Wednesday to dismiss an investor lawsuit seeking to hold them responsible for losses tied to the investment bank’s collapse.  In a 106-page decision, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan said the plaintiffs, which include retirement and pension funds around the world, companies and individuals, sufficiently alleged that Lehman materially misled them about its accounting and its ability to manage risk ahead of its September 15, 2008, bankruptcy.  Kaplan said “it is entirely plausible” that the “misleading picture” Lehman portrayed about its financial condition inflated its stock price and resulted in investor losses.  The decision, in a case that began three months before Lehman went bankrupt, comes amid other investigations into Lehman’s collapse.  In December 2010, the New York attorney general’s office sued Lehman’s accounting firm Ernst & Young, saying it stood by as Lehman painted a false picture of financial health.  Among the other defendants in the investor lawsuit are former Lehman Chief Executive Richard Fuld, former directors including one-time International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) Chief Executive John Akers and theater producer Roger Berlind, and more than 50 bank underwriters.  Lawyers for Fuld, the former directors, most of the underwriters and the investors did not immediately return requests for comments. Ernst & Young did not have an immediate comment. The office of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman was also not immediately available to comment. Lehman’s bankruptcy estate is not named in the lawsuit.  Lehman filed for bankruptcy with $639 billion of assets, and its collapse was a principal trigger of the 2008 global financial crisis. Barclays Plc (BARC.L) took over a large part of its investment banking business. No top Lehman officials have faced U.S. prosecutions over the bankruptcy.  At the center of these case is Lehman’s use of so-called Repo 105 transactions, exposed in a March 2010 report by bankruptcy examiner Anton Valukas.  The examiner found that these transactions allowed Lehman to obscure its financial leverage ratios and health.  In his opinion, Kaplan said the investors failed to show that these transactions materially affected Lehman’s liquidity, or that there was a material misstatement around their use.  But he said the investors sufficiently alleged that some defendants knew the transactions had painted a misleading picture, and that Ernst & Young made a false statement in claiming ignorance of the impact of the transactions.  He wrote that the complaint “adequately alleged” that Lehman overstated its financial strength, understated its leverage, and understated its exposure to risky “Alt-A” mortgages and commercial real estate assets.  Many of the investors who sued said they had bought some of the more than $31 billion of equity and debt that Lehman had issued under a 2006 shelf registration statement.

61,IBM,UPDATE 2-Autonomy boosted as cloud computing sales jump," * Q2 revenue $256 mln (I/B/E/S poll $256 mln   * Q2 adj EPS $0.30 (poll $0.29   * Shares extend gains, up 6.2 percent   (CEO comments, analyst reaction, updates shares)	   By Paul Sandle and Georgina Prodhan	   LONDON, July 27 (Reuters) - Software firm Autonomy  posted a 16 percent jump in quarterly sales on Wednesday, providing more evidence that technology for businesses is more resilient than sales to consumers in an economically fragile Europe.	   The UK company said growth was driven by cloud computing, in which it manages data storage and processing for customers remotely — which also gives Autonomy a clearer outlook because it has long-term contracts with recurring revenues.	   Cambridge-based Autonomy counts Tesco and Proctor & Gamble among a long list of major corporate customers that use its software to search and organise unstructured data like emails and telephone calls.	   Its shares rose sharply following the results, and by 1204 GMT they were up 6.2 percent at 1759 pence, the biggest riser in the FTSE 100 and outperforming a 0.4 percent-stronger European technology index .	    Analyst George O’Connor at Panmure Gordon said Autonomy had delivered a “cracking set of numbers”.	   “What we’ve seen in terms of the reporting season is that consumer-related companies are starting to suffer a little bit... but Autonomy is one of those big beasts in the B2B world... and businesses are spending on tech,” he said.	   Autonomy Chief Executive Mike Lynch said the rapid rise in its cloud business, for both its “protect” applications that help companies comply with data regulations and its “promote” marketing products, was behind the “strong quarter”.	   “We are continuing to see good discretionary spend and that’s driving our promote business,” he said in an interview.	   “On the protect side, we are seeing more and more regulations come in, so we are seeing more deals there.”	   “Our model that we are seeing a gentle sustained recovery seems to be reasonable.”	   Lynch said the growth trend, as well as its acquisition of assets from Iron Mountain completing quicker than expected, meant forth-quarter profits would beat current expectations, and its 2012 prospects would continue to improve.	   Analysts currently expect fourth-quarter earnings per share of $0.37, according to the company.  	   Goldman Sachs said they expected the results to have a positive share price impact, given the encouraging underlying metrics — particularly related to the cloud business, where they see scope for significant acceleration.	   Other technology firms have also been upbeat on prospects. Germany’s SAP said on Tuesday it would reach the high end of its forecasts for the year, echoing comments from peer IBM . 	   Fellow enterprise software maker Sage also reported solid trading on Wednesday, as did IT services firm Atos Origin  .  	   Autonomy, which also counts governments as customers, said product revenues for its core IDOL algorithm products grew 15 percent, slightly slower than in the first quarter as cloud revenues are recognised over a longer period.	   Total sales rose 16 percent to $256 million, in line with expectations, while earnings per share of $0.30 were slightly ahead of expectations.

65,IBM,"Google blasts Apple, Microsoft for patent gang-up","LOS ANGELES/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google Inc, fresh off losing a bid to buy thousands of valuable patents from bankrupt Nortel, accused its biggest rivals on Wednesday of banding together to block the Internet giant in the red-hot smartphone arena.  In a rare public outburst, Google Chief Legal Officer David Drummond blasted Microsoft, Apple, Oracle and “other companies” for colluding to hamper the increasingly popular Android mobile software by buying up patents, effectively imposing a “tax” on Android cellphones.  Apart from increasing costs for consumers, snapping up the patents will stifle technological innovation, he said.  “Microsoft and Apple have always been at each other’s throats, so when they get into bed together you have to start wondering what’s going on,” Drummond wrote in a blog post.  He referred to “a hostile, organized campaign against Android by Microsoft, Oracle, Apple and other companies, waged through bogus patents.”  An Apple spokesman declined to comment.  Google is forging ahead in the smartphone market but has been hampered by a lack of intellectual property in wireless telephony, which has exposed it to patent-infringement lawsuits from rivals including Oracle.  It lost out on the Nortel patents to a consortium grouping Apple, Microsoft, Research in Motion and others, which together paid $4.5 billion.  Google individually had bid up to $3.4 billion for those patents before teaming up with Intel Corp, which on its own had bid up to $3.1 billion, according to a source familiar with the matter.  They bid through $4 billion and then tapped out, another source had told Reuters.  The Internet search leader is now in talks to buy InterDigital, a key holder of wireless patents valued at more than $3 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal.  Google, being a software company, was not focused on patents for a long time but is now shopping to stock up. It recently acquired over 1,000 patents from IBM.  Drummond said Google was looking to further stengthen its patent portfolio.  The wireless industry has been embroiled in a wave of patent suits in recent years as incumbents try to protect their position against newcomers like Google, which entered the market three years ago with Android.  The software, which is now used by phone makers including HTC, Motorola and Samsung, has rapidly overtaken Nokia to become the world’s most popular smartphone platform, with about a third of the market.  HTC received a setback last month when a U.S. trade panel said HTC had infringed two of Apple’s patents.

67,IBM,IFR-Coca Cola claims 2011 low coupon record on 5s and 10s," NEW YORK, Aug 3 (IFR) -  Coca Cola Company (KO.N) set 2011 records today for the lowest coupons on five- and 10-year debt, claiming 1.804% on $1 billion of fives and 3.30% on $1 billion of 10s.  In the five-year market, Coke knocked off a record for five-year money set in July by IBM (IBM.N), which had a 1.95% coupon on a $2 billion deal.  The year’s record low comes amid a rush of companies pricing deals across the maturity spectrum at their lowest funding levels.  Southwestern Public Service Co’s SPS.N $200 million 4.5% 2041s issued today  has tied for the lowest ever 30-year coupon by a corporate. Dominion Resources’s (D.N) $500 million 30-year holding company issue at 4.9% made it to IFR’s top 20 lowest 30-year coupon list this week, as did Public Service Co of Colorado’s $250 million 30-year first mortgage bonds, with the second lowest 30-year coupon in history at 4.75%.  Even BBB-minus rated companies, like Lorillard Tobacco <LO.N,> were able to lock in personal bests at the 30 year end. Lorillard priced a $500 million five-year at 3.5% and during the marketing phase decided to add a $250 million tranche of 30-year bonds, with a coupon of 7% - 1.125% better than the coupon on a 30-year it did last year.  The Barclays Capital US Corporate Index this week hit its lowest yield in 38 years at 3.42%, which is 5bp lower than its previous record of 3.47% reached in November last year. The index has an average maturity of 10.34 years.  Dismal economic news is driving Treasury yields to their tightest this year, and intensified investors’ flight to safe haven high-grade corporate debt, making it a perfect storm for companies looking for funding.  A plunge in the 30-year Treasury yield below the critical 4% level to 3.843%, its lowest since October 2010’s 3.65%, has also led to a flurry of 30-year bond offerings from utilities and corporates this week.  Drivers of the low-yield environment include bad economic news, low dealer inventories for at least two months, a drop in bond issuance in the last two months and inflows - for 30 weeks until this week - into high grade bond funds.  “We are pounding the table telling clients that right now the market is in extremely good shape, despite the negative headlines and their impact on the broader market,” said Rob Kay, managing director and head of investment grade and emerging market debt syndicate at Credit Suisse. “The incredibly favorable technicals  in the market, coupled with the fact that a corporate can lock in all-time low coupons means that if you are not thinking about doing a deal, you should be thinking about one.”  Treasury yields could well go lower in the near future if Friday’s employment figures for July are worse than expected.  Even so, bankers are persuading issuers to come now, rather than later, for the very fact that the rally is based on a more uncertain world, not an improving one.  “Absolute rates are so much lower that certainly an issuer has to take a second look at this market,” said David Trahan, managing director and head of investment grade debt syndicate at Citigroup. “If they are looking at funding later in the year and we are rallying because the world is not a safe place, why would you hesitate?”  Issuers like Coca Cola, as well as scheduled deals being pulled forward are filling the calendar.  “We recommend issuers being more opportunistic when looking to access the capital markets.  Rates and spreads are currently near all-time low levels for many borrowers so capital is available on attractive terms,” said Jim Glascott, head of global debt capital markets at Barclays.   The rally in Treasury yields has coincided with some of the best technicals seen in the market in a year.  Wall Street dealers have kept their inventories low for several months, making it difficult for investors to find any single-A and better rated  corporate paper in the secondary market.  That’s pushed investors into the new-issue market in search of bonds, at a time when earnings season and heightened nerves over European and US sovereign debt has kept many issuers on the sidelines.  “Net supply of investment grade corporate bonds since June 1st has been very light and by some counts, it is actually negative after accounting for fund inflows,” said Rob Stowe, managing director in Barclays Capital’s debt capital markets group.  Issuers also know from experience that windows for issuance can shut quickly.  “We haven’t seen rates at these levels since last November and even then they were only at this level for a three-month period,” said Andrew Karp, managing director and head of investment grade debt syndicate for the Americas at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “Now they are back again and it’s possible that could ignite a new round of accelerated financings.”  That’s resulted in excellent deal execution, with books many times oversubscribed and new issue concessions dropping to what has been close to flat for many trades this week.

68,IBM,Analysis: Enterprise flash storage market ripe for tie-ups,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Competition is brewing in the small but booming market for flash memory used in corporate data centers, and analysts foresee a wave of consolidation as larger players move in.  Giant tech companies from International Business Machines Corp to Western Digital Corp are sharpening their focus on lightning-quick flash storage, hoping to ride a resurgence in corporate IT spending next year and beyond.  They are taking closer looks at the cutting-edge know-how developed by companies like Fusion-io Inc, OCZ Technology Group Inc and STEC Inc, key players in software and controllers crucial for making solid-state drives work effectively in data centers.  “If I were the CEO of a large hard-drive maker I’d definitely be shopping,” OCZ chief executive and co-founder Ryan Peterson told Reuters. “The market is ripe for consolidation.”  Using solid-state drives made of NAND flash memory chips is expensive but is catching on with social media companies, banks and other corporate customers that value speedy and energy-efficient performance.  Corporations will spend some $4.5 billion on the technology in 2015, up from just under $1 billion in 2010, according to IT research house Gartner Inc.  That sharp growth outlook has attracted Wall Street investors as well as business from major server and storage sellers Dell Inc, Hewlett-Packard Co and EMC Corp.  “These guys are working with everyone because they don’t know who is really going to emerge victorious a couple years down the road when the dust settles,” said Gartner analyst Joseph Unsworth. “Right now there’s a deluge of vendors piling into this area.”  In a sign of tougher times, Santa Ana, California-based STEC’s shares plummeted 42 percent in a single day last week when it warned that its lead in the market was under siege.  Much of the value of companies like OCZ, STEC and Fusion-io lies in technology they have invented that accelerates how quickly flash drives work and eliminates errors in reading and writing data — critical factors for corporate customers.  While chipmakers like Micron Technology Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd have built their own solid-state drives, they have made less progress on controllers and software needed to make them work well in data centers, analysts say.  Fusion-io, which makes flash memory modules for servers and boasts Apple Inc’s co-founder Steve Wozniak as its chief scientist, saw its shares soar 34 percent in its stock market debut in June. It counts Facebook and Apple as top customers and is due to post quarterly earnings on Thursday.  Start-up Violin Memory, which makes arrays of flash chips for data centers and is backed by Toshiba Corp, is preparing to hold its own initial public offering. It works with HP and IBM.  Disk-drive makers Seagate Technology Plc and Western Digital have also begun building solid-state drives to diversify their businesses as growth in their traditional market fades.  “If you have really good controller technology, then you’re a likely target,” said Richard Shannon, an analyst at Northland Capital Markets.  Growing demand for enterprise flash storage has already triggered one tie-up between a large memory chip maker and a smaller company with specialized technology.  “What will be interesting to see is if a NAND flash maker buys one of the really good controller guys,” said Shannon, pointing to STEC and OCZ. “Then everyone else had better look out.”  Other privately held players in enterprise flash storage with potentially enticing technology that could be acquired include Virident, Intel Corp backed Anobit Technologies and Texas Memory Systems, analysts say.  In May, Sandisk Corp, known for selling memory for cameras and other consumer devices, spent $327 million to buy enterprise flash storage provider Pliant Technology and gain its technology.  While flash chips are making fast inroads with corporations, most data is still stored on slower and much cheaper hard disk drives, which use pins to read and write data on spinning platters.  Pairing heavyweight chipmakers Micron, Samsung and Toshiba with companies like STEC and Fusion-io would make sense since a major portion of the cost of enterprise solid-state drives comes from the price of flash memory used in them, analysts say.  “Over the longer term, you’re going to see vendors with their own (manufacturing) capacity win, just because their margin structure is going to be superior,” said Avian Securities analyst Matt Bryson.

69,IBM,Three firms drop EU antitrust complaints against IBM,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Three small rivals have dropped their antitrust complaints against International Business Machines Corp that had triggered one of two investigations by EU regulators into IBM’s business practices.  Emulator software vendor T3 Technologies Inc has withdrawn its complaint to the European Commission while Texas-based Neon Enterprise Software has agreed to relinquish its claim, the U.S. technology services company said in a regulatory filing.  French company TurboHercules said on Wednesday it was no longer pursuing its complaint filed with the EU watchdog due to business reasons. The allegations prompted a Commission investigation in July last year.  The Commission said it had no comment on the issue. The regulator could now decide either to continue or scrap the investigation. IBM declined to comment.  The Commission had on its own initiative opened a second investigation into allegations of discriminatory behavior by IBM toward competing suppliers of mainframe maintenance services in July last year.  IBM had said at the time of the allegations that Microsoft and other competitors had inspired the actions by T3 and TurboHercules.  T3 filed its complaint in January 2009 and TurboHercules in March 2010. Both companies had claimed that IBM tied the sales of its mainframe computers to its dominant mainframe operating systems. Neon had in July last year accused IBM of conduct that disparaged its product.  Many big companies and government institutions use mainframes, which are powerful computers, to store and process critical information.

She and Treasury Board President Tony Clement told a news conference the government would streamline its information technology spending, cutting 300 data centers to less than 20 and reducing the 3,000 overlapping and uncoordinated networks.   Clement wants departments to identify scenarios to save 5 percent and 10 percent to balance the budget by 2014-15. He said that it would not be painless, but the task was tiny compared with that in the United States.   “The targets that the Congress and the U.S. administration have to deal with over a multiyear period is $4 trillion. Our target is (C)$4 billion,” he said.   A background paper said about 80 percent of federal departments use Microsoft (MSFT.O) Outlook for e-mail, 15 percent use IBM’s (IBM.N) Lotus Notes and 5 percent Attachmate’s [WIZARA.UL] Novell GroupWise, and departments use different versions and practices within those categories.

73,IBM,"Google cries foul on Apple, Microsoft mobile gang-up","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Google Inc, fresh from losing a bid to buy thousands of patents from bankrupt Nortel, lashed out at its biggest rivals on Wednesday and accused them of banding together to block the Internet giant in the red-hot smartphone arena.  In a rare public outburst, Google Chief Legal Officer David Drummond blasted Microsoft, Apple, Oracle and “other companies” for colluding to hamper the increasingly popular Android mobile software by buying up patents, effectively imposing a “tax” on Android cellphones.  Apart from increasing costs for consumers, snapping up the patents will stifle technological innovation, he said.  “Microsoft and Apple have always been at each other’s throats, so when they get into bed together you have to start wondering what’s going on,” Drummond wrote in a blog post.  He referred to “a hostile, organized campaign against Android by Microsoft, Oracle, Apple and other companies, waged through bogus patents.”  Microsoft and Apple had teamed up to acquire patents previously owned by software maker Novell and bankrupt telecom firm Nortel Networks Corp. to ensure “Google didn’t get them,” Drummond added.  But Microsoft’s General Counsel Brad Smith disputed Drummond’s version on the Novell patent issue on Twitter.  “Google says we bought Novell patents to keep them from Google. Really? We asked them to bid jointly with us. They said no,” Smith tweeted in response to the blog.  Representatives from Apple and Oracle declined comment.  Google — which is facing a federal antitrust probe in the Internet search market it dominates — is forging ahead in the smartphone market. But it has been hampered by a lack of intellectual property in wireless telephony, which has exposed it to patent-infringement lawsuits from rivals like Oracle.  It lost out on the Nortel patents to a consortium grouping Apple, Microsoft, Research in Motion and others, which together paid $4.5 billion.  Google individually had bid up to $3.4 billion for those patents before teaming up with Intel Corp, which on its own had bid up to $3.1 billion, according to a source familiar with the matter.  They bid through $4 billion and then tapped out, another source had told Reuters.  The Android software, now used by phone makers including HTC, Motorola and Samsung, has rapidly overtaken Nokia to become the world’s most popular smartphone platform, with about a third of the market.  Drummond said the company was looking to strengthen its patent portfolio. Google, whose crown jewel is its search algorithm, has never placed the same priority on patents as it has on copyright, but is now hoping to stock up. It recently bought more than 1,000 patents from IBM.  The Internet search leader is now in talks to buy InterDigital, a key holder of wireless patents valued at more than $3 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal.  That shift in mentality comes as a wave of patent suits crisscross the wireless industry. In past years, incumbents have tried to protect their position against newcomers like Google, which entered the market three years ago with Android.  HTC received a setback last month when a U.S. trade panel said it had infringed on two of Apple’s patents.  Also, Samsung has delayed the Australian launch of its latest Galaxy tablet due to a patent dispute with Apple, which says the South Korean electronics giant “slavishly” copied the iPhone and iPad.  And Oracle is suing Google, claiming Android infringed on Java patents that it inherited through an acquisition of Sun Microsystems in 2010.

75,IBM,Apple briefly passes Exxon as largest U.S. company,"SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Apple Inc briefly edged past Exxon Mobil Corp to become the most valuable U.S. company on Tuesday, displacing an old economy stalwart and heralding an era where technology holds sway.  Although Apple slipped back to the No. 2 spot after the close, market watchers said it is simply a matter of time before the company that defined the smartphone and tablet markets with the iPhone and iPad ascends the top.  The technology giant’s market value rose on Tuesday to $341.5 billion in severely choppy afternoon trading, just above Exxon’s $341.4 billion, even though the oil major’s annual revenue is four times that of Apple’s.  Exxon quickly regained the No. 1 spot as its shares rose and Apple’s shed some of their gains, with stocks globally remaining volatile because of soft economic data and the downgrading of the United States’ sovereign credit on Friday.  Exxon ended on Tuesday with a market cap of $348.3 billion followed by Apple at $346.7 billion.  The potential changing of the guard, which is largely symbolic, reflects the influence and power of certain industries over the U.S. economy in different points in time.  “Technology is what people understand now,” said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Banyan Partners. “At some point it used to be the radio, before that it was trains. So I think it’s sort of indicative of our society.”  Tuesday’s move by Apple, which for a short time ended Exxon Mobil’s run of more than five years at the top, capped a remarkable turnaround for a company that once teetered on the brink before Apple CEO Steve Jobs returned to resuscitate the enterprise he co-founded.  Thirteen years ago, some analysts said Apple’s value consisted of real estate holdings and cash on hand.  Apple joined, albeit briefly, a group of nine companies that have held the top spot in the S&P 500, including General Electric Co, General Motors, IBM Corp, Microsoft Corp and AT&T Inc, DuPont, Philip Morris Cos and Wal-Mart Stores Inc, according to Standard & Poor’s Index Analytics.  Apple will officially become the 10th member of that group only if its market cap at the close of trading is higher than Exxon’s, said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Indices.  The Silicon Valley icon, which was included in the S&P 500 index in 1982, has clawed its way to the top of the chart from the 287th position it held 10 years ago, he added.  Exxon became the most valuable U.S. company in 2006 on the back of higher oil and gas prices, while GE got top valuation when heavy equipment, energy, military contracts and finance represented a large portion of the U.S. economy.  GM, which went bankrupt in 2009 and is now back in the market through a new initial public offering, topped the list when automobile manufacturing was biggest symbol of American industrial power.  Apple is riding the mobile wave that has swept up consumers worldwide. Since Jobs’ return, the company has cranked out a string of now-iconic, category-defining products, from the Mac and the iPod music player to the iPhone and now the iPad, which almost single handedly created the tablet computer market.  Apple now demands a position in virtually every long-term investor’s portfolio on the strength of its deft handling of overseas production and supply, as well as perceptions of an unerring antenna for consumer tastes.  Since July 1, Apple’s market capitalization has risen by more than $20 billion, fueled by optimism a new version of its best-selling iPhone will lead to a monstrous second half of 2011.  Exxon’s market cap, on the other hand, has slipped about $50 billion in the same period due to volatile crude oil prices.  But many on Wall Street are concerned about Jobs’ ailing health and fear the company will not be the same without its hard-driving, visionary leader. Others are worried about the rising popularity of Google-powered smartphones.  The two companies, however, have little in common for investors. Exxon pays a regular quarterly dividend, while the last dividend paid by Apple was in November 1995. Also, Exxon spends billions to buy back its own shares each quarter.

But the earnings missed the average analyst estimate and its Nasdaq-listed shares fell more than 7 percent in after-hours trade.   The Waterloo, Ontario-based company made $79.6 million from licensing — a measure of future demand — up 16 percent from a year earlier but below all but one of the nine analysts polled by Reuters. Its overall profit also fell short.   Open Text reported an adjusted net profit of $61.5 million, or $1.05 a share, on revenue of $285.5 million in its fourth quarter ended June 30.   That was up from a year-earlier profit $54.9 million, or 95 cents a share, on revenue of $240 million.   Analysts had on average expected Open Text to earn $1.12 a share on revenue of $283.9 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   Net income before stripping out amortization of acquired intangible assets, share-based compensation and other costs almost halved to $28.6 million.   Open Text paid about $260 million to acquire business process management company Global 360 in July. At the time, Open Text said its second large buy in five months would not add to fourth quarter results.   Some analysts worry that the two companies have overlapping businesses, which could weigh on Open Text’s margins, though its operating margin actually improved from the previous quarter.   In February, Open Text said it would pay $182 million to buy smaller competitor MetaStorm to aid its push into mobile applications. [ID:nN02188563]   Open Text has the second-largest share of the market for enterprise content management systems after IBM Corp (IBM.N). Its partners include tech infrastructure vendors SAP AG (SAPG.DE), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Oracle Corp ORCL.O.   Open Text’s Nasdaq-listed shares closed down 4.7 percent at $57.47 just ahead of the earnings release and fell to $53.17 after the close.

82,IBM,Analysis: Apple going after Google in tablet spats?,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc’s increasingly effective patent war against rivals like Samsung Electronics may mask its real target: arch-foe Google Inc.  The maker of the iPad and iPhone has sued three of the largest manufacturers of Google’s Android-based devices — Samsung, Motorola and HTC — for multiple patent infringements across multiple countries, pointing out “slavish copying” of design and “look and feel.”  And the courts are beginning to listen: recent success in blocking sales of Samsung’s latest Galaxy tablet in most of Europe and Apple’s challenges to the Korean giant in Australia reflect an aggressive effort to defend its top position in the red-hot mobile market from the runaway success of Android.  While the lawsuits don’t take direct aim at the operating software — yet — many of the features under contention are connected to and enhanced by it. Apple CEO Steve Jobs once referred to the software as being the soul of any device when he introduced the company’s iOS 5 system in June.  Brian Marshall, an analyst with Gleacher & Co, said Apple is starting to flex its patent muscle with some early success but its real battle is with the Android software. “Apple doesn’t really care too much about the actual OEMs.”  Apple’s lead is now under siege in smartphones from Google’s free Android software, already the world’s most-used mobile system with 550,000 devices activated every day.  Its momentum could be hampered by successful patent infringement lawsuits against adopters like Samsung.  “The way Google gets sucked into it is through the marketplace,” Ron Laurie, managing director and patent consultant at Inflexion Point Strategy, said.  Any injunction won by Apple, if enforced, could mean that Android may be forced to take out the offending feature from its software design. “That would make it less attractive and people would go elsewhere,” Laurie said.  Google Chairman Eric Schmidt has said rivals are responding to Android’s success with lawsuits “as they cannot respond through innovations.”  At stake is a booming one-year-old market that analysts are already predicting will eclipse the decades-old PC market in a matter of years, a market that Apple fears Google’s software could eventually dominate the way it now leads the smartphone arena.  The tablet market is expected to grow from under 20 million tablets last year to over 230 million in 2015.  While Apple is still the leader by far in the tablet market, research firm Informa expects tablets running Android to catch up with Apple’s iPad and surpass it in 2016.  Samsung, experts say, has the best chance of attacking the iPad’s commanding hold on the market. Apple’s 75 percent share is expected to fall to 39 percent in 2015, when Android’s will grow to 38 percent, according to Informa.  A less visible benefit of Apple waging and winning patent battles against the likes of Samsung, HTC and Motorola would be that Android may effectively no longer be free because of potential licensing costs that need to be paid to Apple.  Android’s major vulnerability lies in the patent arena. Being a fairly new entrant in this market, Google hasn’t built up enough intellectual property in the way Apple or Microsoft has.  “All this will end up making Android less ‘free’, Jean-Louis Gassee, venture capitalist and a former Apple executive, said. “But by how much? Five dollars a handset, no problem. Fifteen dollars — then it is trouble.”  Apple knows the power of licensing — from the losing side as well. It recently forged a cross-licensing patent deal with Nokia, agreeing to make a one-time payment in hundreds of millions of dollars and pay continuing royalties.  But it is Google that had been caught off guard in the patent battle, being historically and philosophically opposed to gathering them as a defensive or offensive move. But that is changing with Google now in the hunt for key patents.  This has sparked an expensive arms race between technology giants as they try to outbid each other to stockpile on valuable patent portfolios up for grabs.  In the high-profile tussle for 6,000 wireless patents from bankrupt Nortel Networks, Google kicked off the tug-of-war with a stalking horse bid of $900 million — far greater than anyone expected. But Apple — allying with Microsoft, Sony and others — swooped in to snap them up eventually for $4.5 billion, a price tag that sent shockwaves through the industry.  Google’s chief lawyer, David Drummond, last week lashed out against Apple and others, accusing them of “a hostile, organized campaign against Android by Microsoft, Oracle, Apple and other companies, waged through bogus patents.”  In the wake of the injunction against the Galaxy in Europe, Apple is seeking a similar ruling against Motorola’s Xoom in German court. It won a preliminary ruling last month from a U.S. trade panel that HTC infringed two of Apple’s patents.  But Apple is not the only one enforcing patent rights on Android mobile devices. Microsoft recently settled a suit with HTC over the Taiwanese company’s Android devices. Oracle is seeking billions of dollars from Google for infringing on Java patents through its Android system.  Analysts expect Apple to continue to be the aggressor.  “It’s clear that the tablet wars are going to be fought on many, many fronts,” Michael Gartenberg, technology analyst with Gartner. “Clearly lots of companies are seeing opportunities here who don’t plan on ceding the market to Apple, and Apple is using everything in its arsenal to defend itself.”  ",8112011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple/analysis-apple-going-after-google-in-tablet-spats-idUSTRE77A6IN20110811
83,IBM,Cisco bulls may underestimate tough road ahead,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc still faces tough challenges with tight public spending and fears of a new economic downturn, analysts warned, after the giant Silicon Valley company ended a year’s worth of disappointing sales forecasts.  Shares of Cisco surged over 16 percent on Thursday, a day after Chief Executive John Chambers delivered quarterly results suggesting that tough measures to return the company to health were paying off, impressing investors who had braced themselves for the worst.  “Cisco was left for dead,” said Gleacher & Co analyst Brian Marshall.  “Investors felt like the earth was salted for Cisco’s opportunity, that their core markets are mid-single digits businesses and ... that Cisco would forever be a one- to two-times GDP grower relegated to the status of an IBM (International Business Machines Corp or an HP (a Hewlett-Packard Co),” Marshall said. “That remains to be seen.”  Chambers, who in April famously warned that the world’s leader in Internet networking equipment had lost its way and a year ago spoke of “unusual uncertainty” in the economy, on Wednesday said he expects gradual improvement in the business.  He signaled that demand from governments and corporations for networking might not be as bad as had been feared.  The Street applauded the upbeat results and outlook, but some analysts questioned whether it was enough to justify such a large stock surge and said much of the jump was probably a reflection of recent broad market volatility.  Cisco’s shares, which had lost a third of their value since the beginning of 2011, were trading at $15.99.  Those analysts warned investors not to underestimate how much public spending budgets could be cut next year and said Cisco might need to prune more product lines and perhaps exit some more unprofitable businesses.  The one-time Wall Street darling, which depends on government spending for about a fifth of its revenue, said in July it would cut 15 percent of its workforce and sell a set-top box factory in Mexico as part of an effort to slash annual expenses by $1 billion.  “Its great that they’re tightening their belts and kind of taming the beast a bit, but there are some fundamental misalignments they still need to address.” Mizuho Securities analyst Joanna Makris said.  She said a budget flush as the U.S. federal government wraps up its fiscal year in September would help Cisco in the current quarter, but government spending next year is less clear.  Brokerage Stifel Nicolaus raised its rating on the stock to “buy” from “hold,” and said Cisco seemed to have left the worst behind, echoing many analysts’ opinions.  “Although the macro environment and public sector spending could continue to put pressure on switching and overall sales, the company is starting to see some stability in orders,” the brokerage said in a research note.  Cisco forecast current-quarter revenue up 1 to 4 percent, in line with expectations. Its fiscal fourth-quarter results were a bit above forecasts. Gross margins, though, came in at 62.7 percent, dipping from 63.9 percent in the fiscal third quarter.  “Gross margin is always a very important issue for a tech company and their gross margins continued to slide. Their topline growth is pretty anemic. And they just made major cost cuts, so we still don’t know their full impact on the total business,” said William Blair analyst Jason Ader.

84,IBM,BUY OR SELL-BMC Software: growth play or too cheap to ignore?," * Q1 rev missed on weak bookings, but pipeline strong   * Cloud business strong, but contribution to rev small   * Shares off 16 pct since Q1 numbers, but had pvsly touched decade-high    By Sayantani Ghosh	   BANGALORE, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Lacklustre quarterly results at BMC Software have triggered a debate over whether this is a blip or an indication of long-term weakness for the business-software maker.	   The company failed to show any bookings growth in April-June at its enterprise services management (ESM) business, the larger of its two divisions, which manages networks, databases and storage, and brings in two-thirds of total revenue.  	   But Houston, Texas-based BMC’s mainframe services management (MSM) unit, which helps automate data center operations, is showing signs of growth.	   Shares of BMC, which competes with CA Inc , Compuware Corp and products offered by Oracle , IBM  and SAP , have fallen more than 16 percent since those results on July 27.	   Just three weeks earlier, the stock had touched a more-than-a-decade high of $56.55. The company is currently valued at close to $7.2 billion.	   The bears say BMC’s low estimated earnings multiple — of 12.4 against a sector average of 39.6 — is a sign of muted future growth. But that cheap valuation may encourage bulls to add to their positions.	   Of 14 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, seven have positive ratings on BMC’s stock, six are neutral and one rates it ‘underperform’.	   LONG-TERM VALUE	   “We believe sentiment is overly negative following the first-quarter miss in the higher-growth ESM business,” said Raymond James analyst Michael Turits, who expects BMC’s cloud products, part of its ESM unit, to drive revenue through this year.	   “The cloud business was somewhat slow last quarter, but our checks suggest their cloud pipeline is really strong,” he said.	   The ESM business, which focuses on servers, may also be boosted as more companies look to optimize by cutting down on redundancy and allocating resources better.	   Last week, Cisco said server sales jumped by a third in its fourth quarter, which bodes well for BMC, whose software piggybacks on Cisco’s servers.	   BMC’s first-quarter MSM bookings grew by a quarter from a year-ago, when growth was skewed by four new orders each worth more than $3 million. There was only a single order of that size in April-June of this year.	   “There’s been a pick-up in capacity renewals, and BMC should get a boost from the IBM mainframe cycle refresh,” said Turits, a top-rated analyst on Starmine, who recently upgraded his rating on BMC’s stock to ‘strong buy’ from ‘outperform’.	   The ESM business was also hurt by slow sales to the United States public sector and a longer sales cycle in Europe as customers are increasingly careful over big orders.	   Cisco, which last month said it will cut 15 percent of its workforce, has also warned that global public sector spending will be weak for the next several quarters. 	   “Cisco is obviously having its own problems and I think that partnership is probably not doing as well as it was a year ago,” Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Derrick Wood said.	   “The stuff they saw this quarter is going to continue to weigh on them and there’s still some risk to numbers going into the next quarter.”	   The new Cloud Lifecycle Management product saw good deal flow in April-June, but is yet to contribute meaningfully to revenue.	   Also, the MSM business, which was propped up by a big order in the first quarter, may decline in the second half as larger deals become harder to close, said Wood, a 4-star-rated StarMine analyst who has a ‘neutral’ rating on BMC stock.	   Sales force attrition and a lower-than-expected number of new hires may translate into weaker sales and hurt the company’s chances of converting prospective customers. 	   BMC expects its average sales headcount to rise about 10 percent in fiscal 2012, down from a previous forecast of an increase in the high-teens.	   Susquehanna’s Wood likes Compuware as it’s present in a space that hasn’t seen much innovation since Hewlett-Packard  bought Mercury Interactive five years ago.	   Compuware, which makes application performance management (APM) software, manages programs running on large computer networks and web-based systems.	   “They’ve made two very strategic acquisitions and the growth in the APM business is in the 30 percent plus range,” said Wood, noting Compuware may take market share more from CA than from BMC, which is not a big player in APM.

85,IBM,"HP may drop PCs, to buy Autonomy for $11.7 billion","SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co is considering a dramatic turn away from the struggling PC business by spinning it off into a separate company and is buying British software maker Autonomy Corp for $11.7 billion, focusing on faster-growing technology sectors.  Underscoring the problems plaguing what was once its core business, the iconic Silicon Valley company also plans to kill WebOS-based phones and the TouchPad tablet, which was launched in June but has failed to excite consumers.  The barrage of news, which forced HP to announce third-quarter earnings an hour early, masked a sharp reduction in HP’s estimates for full-year revenue and earnings that sent its shares 6 percent down to a 52-week low. They slid another 7 percent to $27.50 in after-hours trade.  HP CEO Leo Apotheker is responding to mounting pressure to fire up growth just as global economic and tech-spending outlooks darken. Like other PC makers, it is struggling to come up with an answer for Apple Inc’s iPhones and iPads, which are gobbling up PC market share.  The announcement is the second this week to show how quickly technology companies are transforming as they jockey for position to cope with radical changes in consumer demand. Google Inc on Monday announced it was buying mobile handset maker Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, launching the Internet search and mobile software company into manufacturing for the first time.  HP’s third-largest acquisition ever and its potential departure from the PC arena sets in motion a transformation that recalls International Business Machine Corp’s overhaul of the last decade.  HP “is saying ‘I want to be more like IBM.’ They divested their PC business and they got more involved in software,” said FBN Securities analyst Shelby Seyrafi.  “The PC industry is a very challenged one because of the slow growth in that sector. For those companies like HP which don’t have a strong tablet offering, they are victims of the encroachment of Apple’s iPads and tablets on their notebook business. So they’re vulnerable to losing share.”  The acquisition of cloud search-software specialist Autonomy, which analysts say may draw rival bids, marks its boldest foray into the software and technology services after Apotheker came on board with a mandate to drive innovation.  Speculation has swirled for months that HP was no longer keen on keeping a PC business struggling with low growth and single-digit margins.  Sources told Reuters in June that private equity firms from Blackstone Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts to TPG Capital would like HP to break up and sell them some of its units, arguing that the world’s No. 1 PC maker and tech powerhouse is stretched too thin.  A PC spinoff marks a historic shift for a company that Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard built into a sprawling $120 billion empire from a $538 garage operation in 1939.  “HP is recognizing what the world has recognized, which is hardware in terms of consumers is not a huge growth business anymore,” said Michael Yoshikami, chief executive of YCMNET Advisors, a minor shareholder in HP. “It’s not where the money is. It’s in keeping with the new CEO’s perspective that they want to be more in services and more business oriented.”  Spinning off the PC division, run by personal systems group chief Todd Bradley, would mark one of the biggest makeovers for the company since 1999, when it spun off its measurement and components businesses to form Agilent Technologies.  In 2001, it engineered an acquisition of PC rival Compaq, laying the foundation for its later domination of the sector.  Some alternatives HP is exploring include hiving off its PC business into a separate company through a spin-off or other transaction that would likely be tax-free to U.S. shareholders. HP expects the process to be completed within 12-18 months.  Apotheker, a former chief of European software giant SAP AG, had been expected to drive an expansion of the company’s relatively small but very profitable software division — including through major acquisitions.  Cambridge, England-based Autonomy counts Procter & Gamble Co among a long list of major corporate customers that use its software to search and organize unstructured data like emails. It said the offer values its fully diluted share capital at 7.09 billion pounds ($11.7 billion). The British firm’s CFO, Sushovan Hussain, is on a visit to California, a source told Reuters.  “HP would be buying this as part of a refocus of the business on software,” said Tim Daniels, technology, media and telecoms strategist at Olivetree Securities. “Clients now don’t have a problem accumulating data, the problem is the structuring of it. Eighty percent of the data on the Web now is unstructured: video, pictures, emails, etc.”  HP’s Personal Systems Group also includes smartphones, tablets and the WebOS operating system, pulling in about $41 billion in revenue but only about 13 percent of profit.  HP’s decision to discontinue the TouchPad — which hit the store shelves in July with much costly fanfare — follows poor demand. It was discounted by $100 a month after it was launched in a market dominated by the iPad. WebOS came with the $1.2 billion acquisition of Palm last year.  “There were also a lot of missteps, such as launching it a month before it was ready and pricing it the same as the iPad 2,” said Current Analysis’ Avi Greengart. “It was a great operating system. Everybody was pulling for it but a lot of people weren’t buying it.”  Going forward, HP expects further pressure on its revenue and cut its full-year forecast for the third straight quarter.  HP now expects full-year revenue of $127.2 billion to $127.6 billion, down from a previous estimate of $129 billion to $130 billion. It also cut its earnings per share estimate to a range of $3.59 to $3.70, down from its previous estimate of at least $4.27 per share.

87,IBM,Beaten-down Wall Street slammed by recession fears,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Rising fears of another recession hammered U.S. stocks on Thursday, sending major averages sharply lower in a return to the extreme fluctuations investors endured a week ago.  New worries about the health of European banks set the tone before the market’s open, and a dismal report on regional U.S. manufacturing fueled a downward spiral in which the Dow dropped as much as 528 points, spurring a flight to safe-haven assets like gold.  The Nasdaq ended more than 5 percent lower, the S&P 500 more than 4 percent and the blue-chip Dow off more than 3 percent. Thursday marks the sixth time in the last two weeks that the S&P has moved by 4 percent or more.  “Are we going to go into recession? Most market participants were looking for slow and steady growth, but the statistics and the financial situation here and in foreign economies have disturbed that view,” said Richard Weiss, a Mountain View, California-based senior money manager at American Century Investments.

90,IBM,"Instant view: HP plans PC exit, Autonomy buy; cuts outlook","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard said on Thursday it is considering a sale or spinoff of its personal computer unit, will halt production of its webOS devices such as the TouchPad, and agreed to buy British software firm Autonomy Corp for $10.2 billion.  At the same time, it reported fiscal third-quarter earnings earlier than expected, and lowered its full-year financial forecasts. The following is immediate reaction from investors and analysts.  PETER MISEK, ANALYST, JEFFERIES & CO  “It’s not sustainable what was going on. We think they had to act. They’re going to get leaner and meaner to get faster.”  “It makes a ton of sense for them to exit as much as possible the consumer business. The consumer has become massively competitive, commoditized, and frankly Apple is the only one that’s shown it can make money in the space.”  “(WebOS) was a great operating system. Everybody was pulling for it but a lot of people weren’t buying it.”  “It’s hard to compete against not just Apple but the ecosystem Apple has built which includes apps content and services. There were also a lot of missteps such as launching it (the TouchPad) a month before it was ready and pricing it the same as the iPad 2.”  “HP is really following the IBM model of becoming a services business and selling off your PC.”  “If they spin (WebOS) out with the IP it could be very interesting for a company like HTC.”  “If Google keeps Motorola and gives it a competitive advantage over other Android licenses, one of those licensees may want to hedge their bets by buying WebOS.”  MILAN RADIA, ANALYST, JEFFERIES & CO (LONDON)  “It was inevitable that one of the big guys would come in and buy Autonomy, the question was timing. It’s a large bite in the current market environment for anyone.”  “Autonomy is an inevitable acquisition target because of its unique position in unstructured data — there’s not an obvious rival and there’s strong growth in the unstructured data market.”  “The challenge for HP would be to deliver a knock-out blow. $10 billion is 25 times 2012 predicted earnings, which is a good price after recent falls in Autonomy’s shares, but it would not be deemed an excessive valuation.”  “There’s no reason why any of the big four or five names should not be interested.”  “Without saying so, (HP) is saying ‘I want to be more like IBM’. What did IBM do many years ago? They divested their PC business and they got more involved in software.”  “The PC industry is a very challenged one because of the slow growth in that sector. For those companies like HP which don’t’ have a strong tablet offering, they are victims of the encroachment of Apple’s iPads and tablets on their notebook business. So they’re vulnerable to losing share.”  “Leo was brought over partly because they wanted HP to get more involved in software. So what he’s doing is basically considering spinning off a hardware related business and getting more involved in software. Therefore this Autonomy acquisition is part of that strategy. Analytics is a hotter segment in the software area.”  “This webOS discontinuing is sad but necessary. They were fighting a losing battle. The winners were already decided before they even launched their TouchPad in the marketplace, and the winners are android and (Apple’s) iOS.”  “Although results are in-line with our estimates, the company’s fourth-quarter outlook is well below our projections and the Street.”  “Despite weakness in the stock on this announcement, we still advise investors to stay on the sidelines as we believe more bad things could be lurking around the corner.”  RAJEEV BAHL, CO-HEAD OF RESEARCH, SOFTWARE & IT SERVICES, MATRIX GROUP  On potential bids for Autonomy:  “Would expect both IBM and Oracle to take a good look at Autonomy. For HP it seems a less natural move given their lack of a database or enterprise content platform.”  “For IBM, Autonomy fits well as a piece of their infrastructure offering alongside Cognos and DB2, for Oracle (an existing Autonomy OEM) it expands their market reach significantly into the unstructured data world.”  “Autonomy’s SPE product (which extends Autonomy’s unstructured data capabilities into structured data) would be a hook for both companies.”  “None of this should be surprising, in light of what’s happening to the consumer with respect to the amount and the type of PCs they’re buying and also the fact that even before Leo (Apotheker, the new CEO) took over, the company had been moving more into software and services, specifically targeted at businesses.”  “You know that consumer PCs is the thing that’s dragging that segment down. Because people aren’t willing to pay up. They want the sexy iPad. And they may need a cheap PC, but they’re not willing to pay up. All consumers seem to have eyes for is the iPad.”  On Autonomy: “I think it’s a move for the future, but I don’t think it’s going to be a boost to the bottom line immediately.”  ",8182011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-hp-iv/instant-view-hp-plans-pc-exit-autonomy-buy-cuts-outlook-idUSTRE77H6IM20110818
91,IBM,"UPDATE 3-HP to spin off PCs, $10 bln Autonomy buy-sources"," * HP to buy Autonomy - source   * PC unit spinoff planned - another source   * Deals will be announced Thursday - sources  (Adds analysts’ and investor’s comments, details on HP)   By Megan Davies, Poornima Gupta and Victoria Howley   NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO/LONDON, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) is close to a roughly $10 billion deal to buy British software company Autonomy AUTN.L, a source said on Thursday, and it will announce a long-rumored spinoff of its PC division, according to another source familiar with the company’s plans.   Shares in HP, a storied Silicon Valley icon that dominates the personal computing industry, climbed briefly into positive territory as Wall Street cheered its bold foray into the high-margin software arena and the hiving-off of a struggling personal computing unit.   But the shares backtracked ahead of HP’s quarterly earnings report due after the market close on Thursday, declining 3 percent to $30.45.   A spinoff of HP’s PC arm would confirm speculation that has swirled for months that HP was no longer keen on keeping a business struggling with low growth and single-digit margins.   And it would mark a historic shift — mirroring International Business Machines Corp’s (IBM.N) own transformation — for a company that Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard built into a sprawling $120 billion empire from a $538 garage operation in 1939.   “HP is recognizing what the world has recognized, which is hardware in terms of consumers is not a huge growth business anymore,” said Michael Yoshikami, chief executive of YCMNET Advisors, a minor shareholder in HP.   “It’s not where the money is. It’s in keeping with the new CEO’s perspective that they want to be more in services and more business oriented.”   Sources had told Reuters in June that private equity firms from Blackstone Group (BX.N) and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts [KKR.UL] to TPG Capital [TPG.UL] would like HP to break up and sell them some of its units, arguing that the world’s No. 1 PC maker and tech powerhouse is stretched too thin, according to people familiar with the matter. [ID:nN1E75S0GT] <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    TIMELINE-HP                            [ID:nN15248346]    HP must convince with earnings         [ID:nN1E77G201] ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>   Spinning off the PC division, which is run by personal systems group chief Todd Bradley, would mark one of the biggest transformations for the company since 1999, when it spun off its measurement and components businesses to form Agilent Technologies (A.N).   In 2001, it engineered an acquisition of PC rival Compaq, laying the foundation for its later domination of the sector.   The company plans to announce the spinoff after the market closes, a source told Reuters on condition of anonymity, confirming a report by Bloomberg.   Bloomberg reported HP could pay $10 billion for Autonomy, which is valued at above $6 billion.   HP CEO Leo Apotheker, a former chief of European software giant SAP AG (SAPG.DE), had been expected to drive an expansion of the company’s relatively small but very profitable software division — including through major acquisitions.   Autonomy confirmed it was in talks with HP regarding a potential acquisition, but declined to elaborate and said further announcements would be made when appropriate.   The British firm’s CFO, Sushovan Hussain, is on a visit to California, a third source told Reuters.   Cambridge-based Autonomy counts Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) among a long list of major corporate customers that use its software to search and organize unstructured data like emails. Last month, it posted a 16 percent jump in quarterly sales-driven demand for Internet-based cloud computing. [ID:nL6E7IR1CC]   “HP would be buying this as part of a refocus of the business on software. They have been talking for a while about a focus on software,” said Tim Daniels, technology, media and telecoms strategist at Olivetree Securities.   “Clients now don’t have a problem accumulating data, the problem is the structuring of it. Eighty percent of the data on the Web now is unstructured: video, pictures, emails, etc.”  (Additional reporting by Victoria Howley and Georgina Prodhan in London ; Writing by Edwin Chan in Los Angeles; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Richard Chang)   ",8182011,http://www.reuters.com/article/hp/update-3-hp-to-spin-off-pcs-10-bln-autonomy-buy-sources-idUSN1E77H13120110818

95,IBM,Avnet's M&A; focus on emerging markets,"BANGALORE (Reuters) - Avnet Inc, a distributor of electronic parts and computer gear for the likes of IBM and Apple, is focusing its M&A strategy on emerging markets, where the growth is, seeking to bolster its product offerings in an uncertain market.  “We plan to be aggressive on the M&A front,” CEO Rick Hamada said in a telephone interview.  Hamada, who moved into the top job last month after 28 years at Avnet, has earmarked resources to capture growth opportunities in emerging markets.  He said the company was also talking to prospective targets in the Americas and Asia, but declined to be more specific.  “We have active pipeline conversations and opportunities for both our businesses in major regions that we operate in,” he said.  Avnet’s two divisions — electronics marketing and technology solutions — connect leading technology manufacturers with their customers.  In its last fiscal year, the Americas accounted for 43 percent of total revenue, ahead of Europe, Middle East & Africa on 32 percent and Asia Pacific on 25 percent.  Avnet and its rival Arrow Electronics Inc have been on an acquisition spree to boost revenue.  In 2010, Avnet spent close to $700 million on six deals, and has completed another so far this year. Arrow has completed two acquisitions this year.  The two tech distributors are seeing IT spending decline as customers are cautious with new orders against a backdrop of, at best, sluggish economic growth. Both this month forecast slow growth for the current quarter.  “We have taken our expectation for the September quarter down just a little bit primarily out of respect for this cautious approach,” Hamada said, also noting the big impact on Avnet’s $600 million parts business in Japan from the devastating earthquake there six months ago.  Europe, he said, is mixed, with the components business performing well, while IT is seeing slow organic growth.  “We interpret that European consumption may be somewhat muted ... but because the component business is doing well there, it’s an indication that technology exports for Europe have been pretty strong,” he said.  Shares of Phoenix, Arizona-based Avnet, valued at about $3.9 billion, have dropped by a third since hitting a near-4-year high in mid-May. They last traded at $25.62 on Nasdaq on Friday.

98,IBM,"Instant view: HP plans PC exit, Autonomy buy; cuts outlook","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard said on Thursday it is considering a sale or spinoff of its personal computer unit, will halt production of its webOS devices such as the TouchPad, and agreed to buy British software firm Autonomy Corp for $10.2 billion.  At the same time, it reported fiscal third-quarter earnings earlier than expected, and lowered its full-year financial forecasts. The following is immediate reaction from investors and analysts.  PETER MISEK, ANALYST, JEFFERIES & CO  “It’s not sustainable what was going on. We think they had to act. They’re going to get leaner and meaner to get faster.”  “It makes a ton of sense for them to exit as much as possible the consumer business. The consumer has become massively competitive, commoditized, and frankly Apple is the only one that’s shown it can make money in the space.”  “(WebOS) was a great operating system. Everybody was pulling for it but a lot of people weren’t buying it.”  “It’s hard to compete against not just Apple but the ecosystem Apple has built which includes apps content and services. There were also a lot of missteps such as launching it (the TouchPad) a month before it was ready and pricing it the same as the iPad 2.”  “HP is really following the IBM model of becoming a services business and selling off your PC.”  “If they spin (WebOS) out with the IP it could be very interesting for a company like HTC.”  “If Google keeps Motorola and gives it a competitive advantage over other Android licenses, one of those licensees may want to hedge their bets by buying WebOS.”  MILAN RADIA, ANALYST, JEFFERIES & CO (LONDON)  “It was inevitable that one of the big guys would come in and buy Autonomy, the question was timing. It’s a large bite in the current market environment for anyone.”  “Autonomy is an inevitable acquisition target because of its unique position in unstructured data — there’s not an obvious rival and there’s strong growth in the unstructured data market.”  “The challenge for HP would be to deliver a knock-out blow. $10 billion is 25 times 2012 predicted earnings, which is a good price after recent falls in Autonomy’s shares, but it would not be deemed an excessive valuation.”  “There’s no reason why any of the big four or five names should not be interested.”  “Without saying so, (HP) is saying ‘I want to be more like IBM’. What did IBM do many years ago? They divested their PC business and they got more involved in software.”  “The PC industry is a very challenged one because of the slow growth in that sector. For those companies like HP which don’t’ have a strong tablet offering, they are victims of the encroachment of Apple’s iPads and tablets on their notebook business. So they’re vulnerable to losing share.”  “Leo was brought over partly because they wanted HP to get more involved in software. So what he’s doing is basically considering spinning off a hardware related business and getting more involved in software. Therefore this Autonomy acquisition is part of that strategy. Analytics is a hotter segment in the software area.”  “This webOS discontinuing is sad but necessary. They were fighting a losing battle. The winners were already decided before they even launched their TouchPad in the marketplace, and the winners are android and (Apple’s) iOS.”  “Although results are in-line with our estimates, the company’s fourth-quarter outlook is well below our projections and the Street.”  “Despite weakness in the stock on this announcement, we still advise investors to stay on the sidelines as we believe more bad things could be lurking around the corner.”  RAJEEV BAHL, CO-HEAD OF RESEARCH, SOFTWARE & IT SERVICES, MATRIX GROUP  On potential bids for Autonomy:  “Would expect both IBM and Oracle to take a good look at Autonomy. For HP it seems a less natural move given their lack of a database or enterprise content platform.”  “For IBM, Autonomy fits well as a piece of their infrastructure offering alongside Cognos and DB2, for Oracle (an existing Autonomy OEM) it expands their market reach significantly into the unstructured data world.”  “Autonomy’s SPE product (which extends Autonomy’s unstructured data capabilities into structured data) would be a hook for both companies.”  “None of this should be surprising, in light of what’s happening to the consumer with respect to the amount and the type of PCs they’re buying and also the fact that even before Leo (Apotheker, the new CEO) took over, the company had been moving more into software and services, specifically targeted at businesses.”  “You know that consumer PCs is the thing that’s dragging that segment down. Because people aren’t willing to pay up. They want the sexy iPad. And they may need a cheap PC, but they’re not willing to pay up. All consumers seem to have eyes for is the iPad.”  On Autonomy: “I think it’s a move for the future, but I don’t think it’s going to be a boost to the bottom line immediately.”  ",8192011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-hp-iv/instant-view-hp-plans-pc-exit-autonomy-buy-cuts-outlook-idUSTRE77H6IM20110819
99,IBM,"WRAPUP 5-HP may drop PCs, to buy Autonomy for $11.7 bln"," * Exiting PCs, kicks off dramatic overhaul   * Options include spinoff for PCs, will buy Autonomy   * Shares resume slide after suspension  (Rewrites first paragraph, adds analyst’s comments, updates stock price)   By Poornima Gupta and Paritosh Pansal   SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) may spin off the world’s largest PC business, part of a wrenching series of moves away from the consumer market, including killing its new tablet and buying British software company Autonomy Corp AUTN.L for as much as $11.7 billion.   The moves underscore the problems plaguing personal computers and devices, which have long HP’s business. The iconic company associated with the birth of Silicon Valley also plans to kill WebOS-based phones and the TouchPad tablet, which was launched in June but has failed to excite consumers.   HP’s third-largest acquisition ever and its potential departure from the PC arena sets in motion a transformation that recalls International Business Machine Corp’s (IBM.N) overhaul of the last decade.   The barrage of news, which forced HP to announce third-quarter earnings an hour early on Thursday, masked a sharp reduction in HP’s estimates for full-year revenue and earnings that sent its shares 6 percent down to a 52-week low. They slid another 10 percent to $26.61 in after-hours trade.   HP Chief Executive Leo Apotheker is responding to mounting pressure to fire up growth just as global economic and tech-spending outlooks darken. Like other PC makers, it is struggling to come up with an answer for Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) iPhones and iPads, which are gobbling up PC market share.   “HP is at a critical point in its existence and these changes are fundamental to the success we all want,” Apotheker told analysts on a conference call.   The announcement is the second this week to show how quickly technology companies are transforming as they jockey for position to cope with radical changes in consumer demand. Google Inc (GOOG.O) announced on Monday it was buying mobile handset maker Motorola Mobility (MMI.N) for $12.5 billion, launching the Internet search and mobile software company into manufacturing for the first time.   HP “is saying ‘I want to be more like IBM.’ They divested their PC business and they got more involved in software,” said FBN Securities analyst Shelby Seyrafi.   “The PC industry is a very challenged one because of the slow growth in that sector. For those companies like HP which don’t have a strong tablet offering, they are victims of the encroachment of Apple’s iPads and tablets on their notebook business. So they’re vulnerable to losing share.”   The acquisition of cloud search-software specialist Autonomy, which analysts say may draw rival bids, marks its boldest foray into the software and technology services after Apotheker came on board with a mandate to drive innovation.   A PC spinoff marks a historic shift for a company that Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard built into a sprawling $120 billion empire from a $538 garage operation in 1939.   “HP is recognizing what the world has recognized, which is hardware in terms of consumers is not a huge growth business anymore,” said Michael Yoshikami, chief executive of YCMNET Advisors, a minor shareholder in HP. “It’s not where the money is. It’s in keeping with the new CEO’s perspective that they want to be more in services and more business oriented.” <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   TIMELINE-HP                             [ID:nN15248346]   Apotheker’s job: restore credibility    [ID:nN28140915]   Analysts’ views                         [ID:nN1E77H1IA]   HP’s 10 largest deals since 2000        [ID:nN1E77H1IC]   Breaking views-Goodbye Compaq, hello IBM [ID:nN1E77H1UE] ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>   Speculation has swirled for months that HP was no longer keen on keeping a PC business struggling with low growth and single-digit margins.   Sources told Reuters in June that private equity firms from Blackstone Group (BX.N) and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts [KKR.UL] to TPG Capital [TPG.UL] would like HP to break up and sell them some of its units, arguing that the world’s No. 1 PC maker and tech powerhouse is stretched too thin. [ID:nN1E75S0GT]   Spinning off the PC division, run by personal systems group chief Todd Bradley, would mark one of the biggest makeovers for the company since 1999, when it spun off its measurement and components businesses to form Agilent Technologies (A.N).   The moves turn a company that in some ways tried to mimic Apple into a devout follower of IBM, dropping a tablet with innovative software, checking out of the PC business and embracing the software and services Big Blue today embraces.   HP has twisted and turned before, including controversial former CEO Carly Fiorina’s acquisition of PC maker Compaq in 2001, which a spinoff would undo.   “If HP spins off their PC business ..., maybe they will call it Compaq?” Dell Inc CEO tweeted after the news emerged.   Some alternatives HP is exploring include hiving off its PC business into a separate company through a spin-off or other transaction that would likely be tax-free to U.S. shareholders. HP expects the process to be completed within 12-18 months.   Apotheker, however, made it clear that its printing unit — also the target of spinoff speculation — was very strategic to the company.   Apotheker, a former chief of European software giant SAP AG (SAPG.DE), had been expected to drive an expansion of the company’s relatively small but very profitable software division — including through major acquisitions.   Cambridge, England-based Autonomy counts Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) among a long list of major corporate customers that use its software to search and organize unstructured data like emails. It said the offer values its fully diluted share capital at as much as 7.09 billion pounds ($11.7 billion), were a clutch of convertible bonds be exercised. The British firm’s CFO, Sushovan Hussain, is on a visit to California, a source told Reuters. [ID:nL6E7IR1CC]   “HP would be buying this as part of a refocus of the business on software,” said Tim Daniels, technology, media and telecoms strategist at Olivetree Securities. “Clients now don’t have a problem accumulating data, the problem is the structuring of it. Eighty percent of the data on the Web now is unstructured: video, pictures, emails, etc.”   HP’s Personal Systems Group also includes smartphones, tablets and the WebOS operating system, pulling in about $41 billion in revenue but only about 13 percent of profit.   HP’s decision to discontinue the TouchPad — which hit the store shelves in July with much costly fanfare — follows poor demand. It was discounted by $100 a month after it was launched in a market dominated by the iPad. WebOS came with the $1.2 billion acquisition of Palm last year.   “There were also a lot of missteps, such as launching it a month before it was ready and pricing it the same as the iPad 2,” said Current Analysis’ Avi Greengart. “It was a great operating system. Everybody was pulling for it but a lot of people weren’t buying it.”   Going forward, HP expects further pressure on its revenue and cut its full-year forecast for the third straight quarter.   HP now expects full-year revenue of $127.2 billion to $127.6 billion, down from a previous estimate of $129 billion to $130 billion. It also cut its earnings per share estimate to a range of $3.59 to $3.70, down from its previous estimate of at least $4.27 per share.   Barclays Capital and Perella Weinberg are advising HP, while Qatalyst Partners, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, UBS and JPMorgan Chase are advising Autonomy.   HP also named John Visentin as executive vice president of its services group. Ann Livermore, former HP Enterprise unit chief who was managing the services unit on an interim basis, will move over to the company’s board.

100,IBM,"Analysis: HP - Dial ""M"" for mayhem","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Leo Apotheker’s credibility as a CEO is falling along with Hewlett-Packard’s stock price.  Apotheker, who gained a reputation for sharp business acumen when he headed up SAP, thoroughly flummoxed HP shareholders last week with what some analysts have called a “value destroying” $11.7 billion deal to buy British software maker Autonomy and for sticking a for-sale sign on HP’s PC division — thus scaring off clients for the year or so it will take to decide on the division’s future.  In a resounding rejection of Apotheker’s grand vision, shareholders sent HP shares down almost 20 percent on Friday, wiping out $16 billion of value in the worst single-day fall since the Black Monday stock market crash of October 1987.  Since Apotheker joined HP early last November, the company has lost almost 44 percent of its value, and he has lost a significant amount of investor support.  “We wonder whether activist investors will — and should — begin to exert pressure on the board,” said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein. “If HP’s results don’t improve, the company will ultimately restructure its portfolio and/or replace its leadership.”  Pat Becker Jr., fund manager at Portland, Oregon-based Becker Capital Management Inc, which owns HP shares, noted that Apotheker has continually failed to instill confidence in his conference calls with investors.  “Every time he has gotten on the call, the stock has gone down substantially,” Becker said.  On a conference call last Thursday following the announcements on Autonomy and the PC division, Apotheker failed to fully address key questions from analysts, including why HP was paying a large premium for Autonomy. When asked about the vision for HP’s PC unit, he said the decision could range from an outright sale to a spinoff to a “potential “nontransaction.”  “That call — was that an ‘A’ performance by a CEO on that acquisition?” asked Becker, whose firm holds HP shares.  An HP spokeswoman said the “strategic transformation” is intended to position the company for a new future and drive long-term shareholder value.  While investors applaud Apotheker’s long-term plan to get out of HP’s commoditized PC business, and the Palm WebOS tablet and smartphone business — considered a capital sinkhole — that goes with it, the $11.7 billion bill for Autonomy and haphazard articulation of the spin-off strategy left many shaking their heads.  HP’s purchase price is a stunningly rich 10 times sales of Autonomy, a cloud search specialist whose revenues are equal to only about 1 percent of HP’s.  HP’s Personal Systems Group, which includes the PC business and the now-defunct TouchPad tablet — faces an uncertain future, which may undermine the business and benefit Dell, whose shares ended up nearly 2 percent on Friday in a broadly weak market.  Even more worrying, HP’s new strategic road map marked an about-face on several crucial fronts, signaling a lack of direction. Executives as recently as May had touted how WebOS would be on every HP product from printers to PCs. In March, they had played up the advantages of serving both consumers and enterprise.  In addition, Apotheker has been forced to slash HP’s sales estimates three times since he took over last November.  It is not the first time HP seems behind the curve. it agreed to buy Compaq in 2001 in what turned out to be a rocky merger. IBM, on the other hand, transformed itself by selling its PC arm to China’s Lenovo in late 2004 and establishing its dominance in enterprise IT. HP appears to be trying to replicate Big Blue’s success.  Some analysts and fund managers hold out hope that the company is at least now on the right track and can still catch up by making smart acquisitions.  “Just because they didn’t make the move earlier doesn’t mean they still can’t skate to the where the puck is going,” said Tony Ursillo, an analyst with Loomis Sayles Value Fund.  But he added, “HP has overpaid for every acquisition it has made” in the past year.  One thing that could take the sting out of the steep price tag for Autonomy is the sale of HP’s PC division, which industry experts estimate could fetch as much as $10 billion.  And Apotheker did make at least one correct decision by retiring the TouchPad. Sacconaghi estimates the business lost about $250 million last quarter, or 9 cents a share.  But the events of last Thursday have done little to build confidence in Apotheker. The afternoon of high drama kicked off with a series of rapid-fire announcements: disclosure of acquisition talks with Autonomy; confirmation a deal had been done; announcement that HP was killing its TouchPad and other WebOS devices.

101,IBM,Bargain hunters tiptoe back but remain cautious,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended slightly higher on Monday after four weeks of losses as investors hesitated to take big risks without a catalyst for buying.  The market was led by large-cap techs and industrials until late in the session when a rally faded.  Banks struggled. Bank of America (BAC.N), the largest U.S. bank, fell 7.9 percent to $6.42, the biggest drop among the Dow’s components. Chief Executive Brian Moynihan sent a memo to senior executives last week outlining plans to cut another 3,500 jobs. JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) lost 2.7 percent to $33.41.  “The ground zero of all worries is financials,” said Charlie Smith, chief investment officer of Pittsburgh-based Fort Pitt Capital Group.  Google (GOOG.O), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N) and IBM (IBM.N), were among the top gainers. Hewlett-Packard shares came back from a 20 percent decline on Friday in its worst day since 1987.  The S&P 500 has dropped 12.7 percent so far in August on fears of another recession and the intractable European debt crisis. The rebound came on lower volume than in recent days of selling.  “I don’t see any major appetite for buying stocks. We are driven higher (today) because of selling exhaustion,” said James Dailey, portfolio manager of TEAM Asset Strategy Fund in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.  One possible spark for the market could be Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke’s Friday speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Some in the market hope Bernanke will hint at additional stimulus measures that could buoy stocks.  “Until we get some kind of a catalyst from Europe regarding the sovereign debt crisis or from the Fed later this week, I expect range-bound trading with high intraday volatility,” said Dailey.

U.S. equity strategist Doug Cliggott cited expectations for lower earnings in coming quarters and little hope for price-to-earnings multiples to expand.  Speculation is widespread in financial markets that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will use his Friday speech at a central banker conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to signal a new monetary offensive to support a faltering U.S. economy.  Bernanke, however, is most likely to outline gradual measures, which would disappoint those looking for something dramatic, such as a fresh round of bond buying, known as QE3.

107,IBM,"Analysis: HP - Dial ""M"" for mayhem","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Leo Apotheker’s credibility as a CEO is falling along with Hewlett-Packard’s stock price.  Apotheker, who gained a reputation for sharp business acumen when he headed up SAP, thoroughly flummoxed HP shareholders last week with what some analysts have called a “value destroying” $11.7 billion deal to buy British software maker Autonomy and for sticking a for-sale sign on HP’s PC division — thus scaring off clients for the year or so it will take to decide on the division’s future.  In a resounding rejection of Apotheker’s grand vision, shareholders sent HP shares down almost 20 percent on Friday, wiping out $16 billion of value in the worst single-day fall since the Black Monday stock market crash of October 1987.  Since Apotheker joined HP early last November, the company has lost almost 44 percent of its value, and he has lost a significant amount of investor support.  “We wonder whether activist investors will — and should — begin to exert pressure on the board,” said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein. “If HP’s results don’t improve, the company will ultimately restructure its portfolio and/or replace its leadership.”  Pat Becker Jr., fund manager at Portland, Oregon-based Becker Capital Management Inc, which owns HP shares, noted that Apotheker has continually failed to instill confidence in his conference calls with investors.  “Every time he has gotten on the call, the stock has gone down substantially,” Becker said.  On a conference call last Thursday following the announcements on Autonomy and the PC division, Apotheker failed to fully address key questions from analysts, including why HP was paying a large premium for Autonomy. When asked about the vision for HP’s PC unit, he said the decision could range from an outright sale to a spinoff to a “potential “nontransaction.”  “That call — was that an ‘A’ performance by a CEO on that acquisition?” asked Becker, whose firm holds HP shares.  An HP spokeswoman said the “strategic transformation” is intended to position the company for a new future and drive long-term shareholder value.  While investors applaud Apotheker’s long-term plan to get out of HP’s commoditized PC business, and the Palm WebOS tablet and smartphone business — considered a capital sinkhole — that goes with it, the $11.7 billion bill for Autonomy and haphazard articulation of the spin-off strategy left many shaking their heads.  HP’s purchase price is a stunningly rich 10 times sales of Autonomy, a cloud search specialist whose revenues are equal to only about 1 percent of HP’s.  HP’s Personal Systems Group, which includes the PC business and the now-defunct TouchPad tablet — faces an uncertain future, which may undermine the business and benefit Dell, whose shares ended up nearly 2 percent on Friday in a broadly weak market.  Even more worrying, HP’s new strategic road map marked an about-face on several crucial fronts, signaling a lack of direction. Executives as recently as May had touted how WebOS would be on every HP product from printers to PCs. In March, they had played up the advantages of serving both consumers and enterprise.  In addition, Apotheker has been forced to slash HP’s sales estimates three times since he took over last November.  It is not the first time HP seems behind the curve. it agreed to buy Compaq in 2001 in what turned out to be a rocky merger. IBM, on the other hand, transformed itself by selling its PC arm to China’s Lenovo in late 2004 and establishing its dominance in enterprise IT. HP appears to be trying to replicate Big Blue’s success.  Some analysts and fund managers hold out hope that the company is at least now on the right track and can still catch up by making smart acquisitions.  “Just because they didn’t make the move earlier doesn’t mean they still can’t skate to the where the puck is going,” said Tony Ursillo, an analyst with Loomis Sayles Value Fund.  But he added, “HP has overpaid for every acquisition it has made” in the past year.  One thing that could take the sting out of the steep price tag for Autonomy is the sale of HP’s PC division, which industry experts estimate could fetch as much as $10 billion.  And Apotheker did make at least one correct decision by retiring the TouchPad. Sacconaghi estimates the business lost about $250 million last quarter, or 9 cents a share.  But the events of last Thursday have done little to build confidence in Apotheker. The afternoon of high drama kicked off with a series of rapid-fire announcements: disclosure of acquisition talks with Autonomy; confirmation a deal had been done; announcement that HP was killing its TouchPad and other WebOS devices.  HP also disclosed its results an hour earlier than scheduled, marking the second straight quarter that the company had to release earnings ahead of schedule. And in another small sign of disarray, TouchPad ads featuring “Glee” star Lea Michele continued to run on CNBC on Friday.  While HP’s dire competitive position was in the making well before Apotheker’s arrival, shareholders do not view the CEO’s track record as impressive.  “I was skeptical coming in about whether he had the right background for the job,” Ursillo said. “So far the results are not encouraging.”  ",8222011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-hp-ceo/analysis-hp-dial-m-for-mayhem-idUSTRE77K2IL20110822
108,IBM,Analysis: Outlook for tech spending getting darker,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Hopes are rapidly dwindling that there will be even modest growth in technology spending during the second half of 2011. And 2012 may be no better.  Underscoring how governments around the world are rapidly scaling back purchases to try and reduce swelling deficits, the Navy shocked technology executives last month by quietly announcing it planned to cut its IT budget by a whopping 25 percent over five years.  While most analysts do not expect other agencies to attempt such dramatic cuts, they say that the Navy’s plan is a clear indicator that governments have joined businesses in taking a more critical look at technology spending.  That latest bombshell, coupled with warnings from bellwether technology vendors from Dell Inc to Cisco Systems Inc, are prompting analysts to trim their forecasts and warn of threats to the bottom lines of major suppliers from IBM to Hewlett-Packard Co.  “They are putting more scrutiny on spending. They are looking at cutting back,” said Rebecca Wettemann, an analyst with technology research firm Nucleus Research.  It is unclear what might happen to budgets at other U.S. agencies as they wait for a congressional deficit super-committee to identify new spending cuts. The group is charged with finding at least $1.2 trillion in budget savings by November 23.  Meanwhile, European technology budgets are likely to contract as the region’s economy worsens.  “We could go into an economic recession and see tech spending decline,” said Forrester Research analyst Andrew Bartels.  While Bartels remains hopeful that global IT spending will grow in the second half, he warns of a “high probability” Europe will slip into a recession in the third or fourth quarter, causing tech spending there to drop from last year.  Gartner, the world’s biggest technology research firm, is planning to cut its forecasts for IT spending when it updates those numbers next month.  It now expects spending to rise about 3 percent at constant currency in the second half of this year, below its current forecast for 3.6 percent growth.  Gartner also projects that IT spending will grow about 3 percent next year, below the current forecast for 5 percent growth, said Gartner analyst Richard Gordon.  “We are still in the hangover of the global financial crisis and the subsequent recession,” he said.  Other experts on technology spending are even more pessimistic.  Two academics who advise big corporations on technology strategies said that some of the world’s biggest corporations could cut IT budgets before the end of the year. That could cause total technology spending to drop in both the fourth quarter and all of 2012.  Eric Johnson, director of the Center for Digital Strategies at the Tuck School of Business, said hardware makers in particular will be under pressure because companies are delaying upgrades of PCs and servers. Instead they are spending money on smaller, portable devices like Apple Inc’s iPad, which has a lower unit cost.  “There is a huge movement going on to less-expensive devices. It’s a tidal wave,” he said. “I call it the deflation of technology.”  One of the main victims of that trend is HP, which just killed the TouchPad tablet it created to challenge the iPad, cut earnings projections, and announced it is considering pulling out of the PC business, where it is the largest player.  “HP waited too long to get out of the PC business,” Johnson said.  Howard Anderson, a lecturer at MIT’s Sloan School of Business, said his contacts in the corporate world are cutting back on hardware purchases. But he expects Apple and makers of other hot mobile devices to fare better in coming months than most technology companies because consumers are so far willing to spend on the latest gadgets.  “If I work for a corporation, it’s ‘Guess what? Your laptop is going to last another year. Suck it up,’” he said. “But if I absolutely have to have the next iPad or iPhone, I’ll find a way to buy it.”  ",8242011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-technology-slowdown/analysis-outlook-for-tech-spending-getting-darker-idUSTRE77N7TY20110824
109,IBM,Analysis: Little relief seen as U.S. finalizes patent reform,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congress is tantalizingly close to passing patent reform that President Barack Obama has hailed as an economic booster, but the legislation is expected to do little to divert money away from patent litigation and toward innovation.  The Senate will vote on September 6 on whether to take up a patent reform bill passed by the House of Representatives in June.  Senate passage seems possible that same week given that the Senate approved a similar bill by an overwhelming margin in March.  The legislation would come just weeks after Google Inc (GOOG.O) agreed to pay $12.5 billion to buy Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc (MMI.N) — scooping up a trove of 17,000 phone-related patents to defend against infringement lawsuits in its Android operating system.  But high-tech companies, which have been the driving force for patent reform, would get little relief from the legislation that has been watered down to gain support.  “The tech sector wanted patent reform to offer alternatives to litigation. Instead, they have extensions of the patent process itself. That’s fine for other industries, but not for tech,” says Brian Kahin of the tech trade group Computer and Communications Industry Association.  The bill would allow the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to set its own fees, in the hopes that it would be able to clear a years-long backlog of patent applications.  The measure would also create a post-grant review process to allow challenges to bad patents, and would grant patents to the first inventors to file, rather than requiring inventors to show they were the first to develop an innovation.  But companies still feel that they need ammunition to stem the flood of legal challenges, which is why tech companies like Google, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) have spent billions of dollars to protect their products.  “How many jobs could have been created with all this money? This is a large waste. I’m sure Google would rather be spending the money doing things, instead of buying patents,” said Daniel Ravicher, who heads the Public Patent Foundation and is a critic of patent reform.  There were 2,296 patent lawsuits in 2000 in district courts. That number rose 23 percent to 2,833 in 2010 and is on track to hit 3,000 this year unless the economy declines again, said Joshua Walker, head of LexMachina, which tracks patent litigation.  In addition, the number of defendants per lawsuit has risen — from an average of two in 2000 to three in 2010.  The stakes are high in patent litigation. In 2006, Research in Motion Ltd RIM.TO was facing a potential court-ordered shutdown of its BlackBerry system before finally settling a long-running patent dispute.  There is some hope that the pending legislation could make a small dent in the growth of patent litigation.  Some tech industry experts believe that a better-financed, better-run patent office which issues fewer bad patents would eliminate a percentage of lawsuits. Half of the patents challenged in court now are invalidated, says Ravicher, which means they never should have been issued.  But reforming the patent office will not likely be enough to reverse the legal trends.  “We’re going to see more litigation not less. For example, 2011 is looking like it’s going to be the biggest patent litigation year on record,” said Walker. “I don’t think the patent reform bill will slow that.”",8252011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-congress-patent/analysis-little-relief-seen-as-u-s-finalizes-patent-reform-idUSTRE77O63C20110825
110,IBM,Lufthansa optimistic for 2011- CEO," FRANKFURT, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Lufthansa will not be rushing in to pick up routes cut by smaller rival Air Berlin  and is confident it will achieve its targets for 2011, Chief Executive Christoph Franz said.	   “For 2011, I confirm we are aiming for a positive result above that of the previous year. We have four months of the year left, but I’m confident,” Franz said at an event in Frankfurt on Monday evening.	   He said that, while the Euro zone crisis had hit customers, Lufthansa was seeing good demand, with passenger numbers rising.	   He added the airline was growing faster than the market thanks to improved capacity and productivity of its planes.	   When asked whether Lufthansa would take on the routes cut by Air Berlin, Franz said there may well be gaps left in the market, but that not all routes would be interesting for Lufthansa in terms of making a profit. 	   “Everyone has to consider whether they’re focused on earning money or on increasing competition. We forget sometimes that as an industry we have to earn money,” he said.	   Many airlines have cut back on their winter timetables this year in order to protect profits as fuel costs soar.   	   Franz said Lufthansa was looking at options for its loss-making units, but that there was not yet a concrete decision on plans for bmi or Austrian Airlines, which said last week it would miss its 2011 target of returning to a positive operating result. 	   He said the group was looking for strategic partners for its IT division Systems, but that no decision had yet been reached here either. Media reports have said that IBM and Tata have bid to take over the unit.

IBM said the deal, expected to close before the end of October, expands its business analytics capabilities by helping clients manage financial risk.  Laurence Trigwell, IBM’s head of business analytics for financial services, said there was significant demand from banks, financial markets and insurance firms for analytical insight, both to improve performance and comply with increased regulation.  “We see risk analytics as a critical component of that analytical insight, driven by market factors and events over the last 10 years since Basel II (banking regulations) and over the last three or four since the financial crisis,” he told Reuters in an interview.  “(Alogrithmics’) heritage in helping banks produce risk models is incredibly important to help respond to regulatory pressures.”  Algorithmics’ risk analytics software, content and advisory services are used by banking, investment and insurance businesses to help assess risk, address regulatory requirements and make more insightful business decisions.

123,IBM,Insight: Cisco suits on China rights abuses to test legal reach,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Two lawsuits by three Chinese dissidents and a human rights group accusing Cisco Systems Inc. of abetting imprisonment and torture could have far-reaching impact on how U.S. technology companies conduct business in authoritarian regimes.  The lawsuits filed in May and June target a second technology company for complicity in human rights abuses in China after Yahoo Inc. in 2007 paid to settle a case in which it was accused of aiding the prosecution of dissidents.  Both cases could provide answers to an evolving legal question: Can U.S. companies be held liable if foreign governments use their products for repression?  The first lawsuit, filed in May by the Human Rights Law Foundation in Washington in the Federal District Court in San Jose, California, accuses Cisco of designing products to help the Chinese government persecute members of China’s banned spiritual group, Falun Gong.  Last Friday, the rights group amended its original complaint, saying it had new evidence that Cisco customized its products specifically to enable the authorities to persecute members of Falun Gong, some of whom were alleged to have been tortured and killed by the Chinese authorities.  The second suit, filed in June in the U.S. District Court in Maryland, says the company was complicit in the arrests and detentions of political writers Du Daobin, Zhou Yuanzhi and Liu Xianbin.  The lawsuits are drawing broad attention from U.S. companies because these are important test cases of the Alien Tort Claims Act, a law dating back to 1789 that accommodates actions in U.S. courts to uphold international law.  “Undoubtedly this is going to be a big case because I think everyone is waiting for the Supreme Court to make a decision,” said Farzana Aslam, a law professor who teaches a course on business and human rights at the University of Hong Kong.  “The reason you’ve got the NGOs engaged is they want to push this issue on a broader platform — the issue of whether corporations should be held accountable for human rights violations.”  Marco Simons, legal director for environmental rights group Earth Rights International who has spent 10 years litigating cases against corporations under the Alien Tort Claims Act, said the lawsuits could test the courts on the standards for liability in aiding and abetting human rights abuses.  “These cases present what will likely be a fairly clear case of Cisco knowing that it is designing systems that would be used to persecute people,” Simons said. “But where the plaintiffs might have a harder time is showing that Cisco really intended to persecute people.  “That wouldn’t really be impossible to show,” he said. “But it’s much easier to show knowledge rather than purpose. These cases could be important for testing that distinction and standard.”  Cisco is the world’s biggest maker of Internet networking equipment. Both lawsuits name several Cisco executives, including Chief Executive John Chambers.  David Cook, Cisco’s communications director for Asia-Pacific, said the company “builds equipment to global standards which facilitate free exchange of information, and we sell the same equipment in China that we sell in other nations worldwide in strict compliance with US government regulations.”  “Cisco does not operate networks in China or elsewhere, nor does Cisco customize our products in any way that would facilitate censorship or repression,” Cook said in emailed comments.  But Daniel Ward, the lawyer representing the three dissidents, said that Cisco “built the entire backbone” of China’s Golden Shield Project, also known as the Great Firewall — the cloak of Internet security authorities use to censor the Internet and track opponents of the Chinese government.  He called the project the 21st-century version of the deadly crackdown on the Tiananmen Square democracy movement in 1989.  “You don’t have to drive tanks to fend away protesters, you just need to pick them off one by one before they have a chance to work on it,” Ward told Reuters. “And they are doing that with technology and software and infrastructure designed and created by Cisco.”  The lawsuit said Cisco “willingly and knowingly provided Chinese officials with technology and training to access private Internet communications, identify anonymous web log authors, prevent the broadcast and dissemination of peaceful speech, and otherwise aid and abet in the violation of...fundamental human rights.”  Both Du and Zhou told Reuters that Chinese security agents had told them during interrogations that they had monitored all their emails.  Du served a three-year prison term starting in June 2004 for “inciting subversion of state power” — a broad charge that China often uses to punish dissidents — while Liu is serving a 10-year sentence on the same charge starting late March. Zhou was detained in 2008 on the pretext of “revealing state secrets.”  Terri Marsh, a lawyer for the Human Rights Law Foundation, told Reuters that its new evidence includes a PowerPoint presentation from Cisco that describes a specific line of products “as the only product on the market capable of recognizing over 90 percent of Falun Gong pictures.”  “This directly implies that Cisco was involved in the final step of the customization — configuring its product to recognize and inspect for Falun Gong information,” Marsh said in emailed comments.  Marsh also said two Cisco employees were quoted as saying in an online Cisco Q&A in 2006 that a person should “use Cisco’s equipment” in response to a question on how a city-wide network can “guard against Falun Gong.”  Cisco’s Cook said that the company was currently reviewing the amended complaint.  “As we said in May when the lawsuit was filed, there is no basis for these allegations against Cisco, and we intend to vigorously defend against them,” he said.  In 2008, at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Cisco denied allegations by a human rights activist who said the company had given Chinese authorities technical help in their efforts to censor the Internet.  U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS  While civil litigation cases under the act could take up to an average of 10 years, the suit against Cisco could be a major flashpoint in relations between Washington and Beijing, which have tussled on trade, Internet censorship, human rights and U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.  “It will be interesting to see politically what the U.S. does in relation to these cases,” Simons said. “Issues involving human rights abuses in China are very politically sensitive with the U.S. government.  “In many of the past cases, the U.S. government has intervened to tell the courts to dismiss the case or to express concerns about potential foreign policy problems with China,” he said, adding that most of these were under the Bush administration.  In 2002, the U.S. State Department urged dismissal of a lawsuit against Liu Qi, the Beijing mayor, for human rights abuses committed by Beijing police against Falun Gong practitioners, asking the courts to “be cautious when asked to sit in judgment on the acts of foreign officials taken within their own countries.”  “The Obama administration to my knowledge has not intervened in any Alien Tort cases to suggest that they should be dismissed,” Simons said. “A case like this could test that.”  The suits against Cisco raise a set of tough issues for Western technology companies that want to do business in China, which has the world’s largest number of Internet users.  Ward said his firm was lobbying the U.S. Congress about re-evaluating how American companies conduct their business in China. In February 2006, U.S. lawmakers lashed out at Google Inc., Yahoo Inc., Cisco and Microsoft Corp., because of the companies’ alleged complicity in human rights abuses by the Chinese government.  China treats political dissent as a crime and heavily filters the Internet to suppress it. Since February, it has waged a crackdown on dissent, detaining dozens of dissidents, including famed artist Ai Weiwei, mostly for writing articles critical of the government.  Microsoft’s search engine Bing filters out results in China relating to controversial subjects, such as political dissidents and Taiwan, to be able to operate in the country.  The Alien Tort Claims Act — passed to combat piracy not long after the United States was founded — has been used as the basis of litigation mostly against oil companies and mining firms. Only in recent years has the act been used to target technology firms by human rights groups, who say the companies are complicit in abuses when they help regimes intercept emails and block websites.  In 2009, a U.S. judge ruled that lawsuits seeking monetary damages can continue against five large companies including IBM, which is accused of aiding South Africa’s former apartheid system of racial segregation.  In 2007, Yahoo Inc settled a lawsuit alleging it aided China’s prosecution of several dissidents in a case that prompted criticism of the company for cooperating with an authoritarian government.  Yahoo was criticized by the U.S. Congress when it released to Chinese authorities information relating to the email account of Shi Tao, a Chinese journalist who was arrested in 2004. Shi was sentenced to 10 years in jail for revealing state secrets.  Du, 48, who was jailed for posting articles under a pseudonym on the Internet criticizing the Chinese Communist Party’s rule, said Western technology companies should not cooperate with a government that violates civil rights.  “This kind of cooperation hurts us as well as the companies’ business,” he said. “The publication of our articles are closely monitored and once they’re published, we will end up in jail.”  Du said he was interrogated by police in early August about the lawsuit, but added that the case was “not only for myself, but also for the freedom of every individual in China, to put an end forever to China’s ‘literary jail.’”  ",9092011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-cisco/insight-cisco-suits-on-china-rights-abuses-to-test-legal-reach-idUSTRE78809E20110909

Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.	   * France’s largest private-sector banks will likely suffer further credit-rating downgrades this week, the latest sign that the debt crisis on the euro zone’s periphery is slowly infecting the core of the region’s financial system.	   * As middle-market shoppers trade down to cheaper goods, the divide grows between high-end and low-end shoppers.	   * Frank Quattrone, a top technology banker once sidelined by regulatory woes, has returned to big-time deal making partly by tapping a network of former clients, including several executives who held controversial “Friends of Frank” brokerage accounts containing hot initial public offerings.	   * Richard Sylla, a financial historian at New York University’s Stern School of Business, sees better days ahead for stocks, albeit in a few years.	   * The Fed asked Capital One Financial Corp to respond to questions that appear aimed at determining whether the proposed acquisition of  ING Groep NV’s U.S. online-banking business would create a bank so large and complex that its failure would pose a risk to the financial system.	   * A troubled partnership of Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and Suzuki Motor appeared on the verge of collapse after the German company said its Japanese partner violated their contract by agreeing to buy diesel engines from another car maker.	   * Just as the nuclear industry faces growing uncertainty brought on by the crisis in Japan, Toshiba is having to spend more than $1.6 billion to raise its stake in U.S.-based nuclear-energy company Westinghouse Electric Co. to 87 percent from the current 67 percent.	   * U.S. financial regulators are likely to miss an October deadline for the Volcker rule, a hotly contested part of last year’s financial-overhaul law that limits financial firms from trading with their own money.	   * Thailand, the world’s biggest rice exporter by volume, is placing a hefty, and some economists say reckless, bet that prices for the grain will spiral higher as demand increases.	   * Booming demand for BlackBerrys in Indonesia and elsewhere in the developing world is lifting hopes that Research In Motion   still might have the means to grow even as market share for its smartphone plummets in the U.S. and other wealthy countries.	   * WellPoint Inc and International Business Machines Corp are set to announce a deal on Monday for the health insurer to use the Watson technology, the first time the high-profile project will result in a commercial application.	   * Much of the blame for Yahoo Inc’s lack of revenue growth in recent years fell on Chief Executive Carol Bartz.

127,IBM,Dell cautiously optimistic on Europe and Asia,"LONDON (Reuters) - Dell Inc, the world’s second-largest computer maker, is cautiously optimistic that its strong performance in Europe and Asia will continue, but is concerned about U.S. government spending, an executive said.  Steve Schuckenbrock, who runs the U.S. company’s $8 billion services business, told Reuters it was yet to be seen whether a typical September spending surge as U.S. federal budgets close would happen this year.  “We’re continuing to monitor demand big-time, as European issues, U.S. issues continue to get debated and discussed,” Schuckenbrock said in an interview in London on Tuesday.  Dell, which had been predicting 5 to 9 percent revenue growth this fiscal year, cut its forecast to between 1 and 5 percent last month, even though sales in growth markets outside north America, western Europe and Japan increased revenues by 14 percent, accounting for 28 percent of sales.  “We’re very happy with the performance of both Asia and EMEA throughout the second quarter ... so we’re cautiously optimistic about both of those continuing,” Schuckenbrock said.  Dell, an economic bellwether because of its dependence on government, corporate and consumer technology spending worldwide, has been diversifying from hardware into higher-margin services, but at a slower pace than some rivals.  Hewlett-Packard Co said last month it planned to spin off its PC business and would buy enterprise search software company Autonomy Corp Plc for about $11 billion, in a strategic shift under new CEO Leo Apotheker.  IBM sold its PC division to China’s Lenovo Group six years ago.  Schuckenbrock said Dell had no intention of following in their footsteps by selling its hardware business and could benefit from HP customers’ uncertainty as the company may take up to 18 months to make a definite plan for its PC unit.  “We’ve never even discussed exiting the hardware business and so we’re quite delighted to go tell customers we’re here for the long haul,” he said.  Dell began offering multi-vendor support for customers running non-Dell hardware or wanting to migrate to Dell two months ago in the United States, and has just begun to offer the same service in Europe.  Schuckenbrock said Dell had already signed up two major U.S. customers, before or around the time of the HP announcement.  Dell has, however, made 10 acquisitions totaling more than $6 billion in the last 18 months to beef up its capabilities in areas like storage, security and database management — and Schuckenbrock said there would be more to come.  The company was particularly keen to expand its services offering in Europe and was interested in software applications companies with expertise in particular industries, or verticals, like financial services, education or retail, he said.  Schuckenbrock said Dell, which has more than $16 billion in cash, was more interested in small or medium-sized acquisitions of up to $1.5 billion than mega-mergers that would come with unwanted legacy technology and could be hard to integrate.  “What I don’t want to buy is a company that has hundreds of outsourcing contracts that are kind of baked in yesterday’s customized services models.  “I think we want to lean very hard into where is the industry going, which is cloud,” he said, referring to cloud computing, in which data and software are stored and processed remotely in large data centers and delivered back to customers over the Internet.  Schuckenbrock said a major barrier to wider adoption of cloud computing was the pain of moving software applications into the cloud, and said Dell was therefore focused on buying companies which were strong in the applications business.  “That opens up the possibilities of companies across Europe a lot, because there are a good number of companies with talent in the applications arena, some of which are focused on one vertical,” he said.

128,IBM,Insight: Power reliability will cost Americans more,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major blackouts like the one that affected 5 million people in the U.S. Southwest and Mexico last week are rare, but occur more often in the United States than in some other developed nations because U.S. electric companies keep excess power capacity, and consumer costs, to a minimum.  U.S. utilities could shore up reliability, but experts are divided over whether customers would be willing to spend the billions needed to harden the grid to significantly reduce outage risks.  “The fact that the power went out for about 12 hours (in San Diego) does not justify doubling electric rates for the whole rest of the year,” said Jay Apt, Executive Director of Carnegie Mellon’s Electricity Industry Center.  Although most outages are relatively small, blackouts and brownouts, including those due to hurricanes and other storms, do cost Americans an estimated $150 billion a year in spoiled food, lost productivity and other costs, according to data from the Galvin Electricity Initiative.  “The U.S. does not have the excess generation some other nations have. We don’t have two of everything and we shouldn’t - you would not want to pay for it,” Apt said, noting U.S. electric rates are about half of some European rates because the United States runs an efficient power system.  And still the electric grid in the United States remains one of the most dependable in the world.  “We are 99.99 percent reliable. But you still have that (0.01) percent of the time something is going to happen. Nobody is perfect,” said Andrew Phillips, Director of Transmission and Substations at the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI).  Preliminary estimates of the cost of last week’s blackout in the greater San Diego region were $97-$118 million, including spoiled food ($12-$18 million), government overtime ($10-$20 million) and lost productivity ($70 million), according to a report by the National University System Institute for Policy Research, which conducts research in the San Diego area. The study did not include costs from the blackout outside of the San Diego area.  The Sept 8-9 power outage affected Southern California, Arizona and Baja California in Mexico. Its cause was related to work in a substation in western Arizona that tripped a giant 500-kilovolt power line carrying electricity to the San Diego area.  That outage ultimately knocked out more than 4,000 megawatts of generation, including the San Onofre nuclear plant in California. One megawatt powers about 1,000 homes.  Pinnacle West Capital’s Arizona Public Service power company, which owns the Arizona substation, said it was investigating the outage because “operating and protection protocols typically would have isolated the resulting outage” to the area around the substation in Arizona.  Roughly 500,000 Americans spend at least two hours each day without power. But that is only a small fraction of the 312 million U.S. power consumers and big blackouts like San Diego are extremely rare.  The majority of outages are failures at the local level where most investment needs to happen, said John Kelly, Executive Director at the Galvin Electricity Initiative. His group seeks regulatory and market reforms to encourage power companies to invest in the modernization of the grid.  To modernize the grid, Kelly said power companies would have to spend $500 billion to $1 trillion over the next 10 to 15 years on new cleaner generation, transmission and distribution systems, including smart meters, automation equipment and software at consumers’ homes and businesses.  That’s a lot of money, but Kelly estimated Americans could save two to three times that amount (up to $3 trillion) over the same 10 to 15 years if regulators require power companies to commit to reliability improvements to recover their investments, among other things.  Other energy experts believe Americans might be willing to pay a bit more to make the system a little more reliable.  “I think people will be surprised there is a willingness to pay somewhat more for a somewhat hardened grid and better outage response assistance,” said Steve Mitnick, President of the not-for-profit energy research group Build Energy America.  Mitnick said investing billions in the smart grid and other equipment needed to harden the power system would likely only add pennies a day to the average residential electric bill.  The smart grid uses technology to respond to data from generation, transmission and consumers’ homes and businesses to efficiently deliver reliable power at the lowest cost.  Several companies participate in the smart grid space, including smart meter and automation companies Itron and Echelon, and some of the world’s biggest technology companies, including IBM, General Electric, ABB, Siemens, Toshiba and Cisco.

129,IBM,Microsoft boosts dividend 25 percent,"(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp announced a 25 percent increase in its quarterly dividend on Tuesday to 20 cents per share, as the technology giant hands more cash back to shareholders frustrated with its stagnant share price.  The increase, following a 23 percent hike last year, is on the high-end of the range expected by Wall Street, but still may disappoint some investors hoping for a greater payout from Microsoft’s $53 billion pile of cash and short-term investments.  Shares of Microsoft rose 12 cents to $27.10 in extended trading on Tuesday.  The latest increase, payable on December 8 to shareholders of record as of November 15, 2011, means Microsoft’s dividend yield is now about 3 percent.  That puts it in the mid-range of comparable large tech firms, with Intel Corp hovering around 4 percent and IBM Corp at around 1.8 percent. Cisco, which introduced a dividend earlier this year, is at around 1.5 percent. Google Inc and Apple Inc do not pay dividends.  A regular dividend is generally regarded as a mark of a mature company that cannot match earlier growth rates or stock gains, and tends to attract more conservative investors.  Despite explosive growth in the 1990s, Microsoft finds itself in that category, with a share price essentially unchanged for the past decade.  Microsoft, which went public in 1986, paid its first annual dividend in 2003. The following year it issued a special dividend of $3 per share — shelling out more than $30 billion in one go — and started paying a quarterly dividend, which it has raised in increments most years since then.

134,IBM,US STOCKS-Wall St rebounds on Fed and Greece hopes," * Fed begins two-day policy meeting   * S&P downgrades Italy’s credit rating   * Apple hits all-time highs   * Dow up 1.1 pct, S&P up 1.1 pct, Nasdaq up 0.7 pct  * For up-to-the-minute market news see [STXNEWS/US]  (Updates to early afternoon)   By Claire Sibonney   NEW YORK, Sept 20 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks pushed higher on Tuesday afternoon as investors were cautiously optimistic that the U.S. Federal Reserve will offer more economic stimulus and that Greek debt talks were progressing.   The broad-based rally included economically sensitive financial and commodity shares, though defensive sectors such as utilities, telecommunications and health care were up closer to 2 percent, leading the way higher.   AT&T Inc (T.N) rose 1.9 percent to $29.13, while biopharmaceutical company Celgene Corp (CELG.O) surged 7 percent to $65.46.   “It’s a combination of expectations for something positive to come from the Fed and also Europe’s ability to withstand the continued negative concerns about sovereign debt,” said Michael James, senior trader at regional investment bank Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles.   At the Fed’s two-day meeting that started Tuesday, the central bank is expected to try to push already low long-term interest rates even lower by tilting toward longer-duration bonds in its portfolio, a move known as Operation Twist. For details, see [nFEDAHEAD]   Meanwhile, U.S. markets also took their cue from buoyant European dividend-paying shares, which showed resilience after the initial shock of Standard & Poor’s downgrade of Italy’s credit rating. Investors took comfort from news in the previous session that Greece was close to a new deal with the troika of international lenders — the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.   Market players warned that the rally could be short-lived as investors typically “buy the rumor and sell the fact,” and may be tempted to take profits on Wednesday after a strong performance all last week.   The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI climbed 125.83 points, or 1.10 percent, to 11,526.84. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX gained 13.62 points, or 1.13 percent, to 1,217.71. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC rose 18.28 points, or 0.70 percent, to 2,631.11.   Technical indicators, however, pointed to a positive “risk on” tone over the next week. Recent indicators, including the strikingly low number of stocks trading above their 10-week moving averages indicate heavily oversold conditions, said Ron Meisels, technical analyst and president of Phases & Cycles in Montreal.   Meisels is looking for the year to end on stronger ground, but for that to happen, he said the S&P 500 needs to hold above 1,125 to avoid the risk of a sell-off close to 1,000. Before then, he noted the market is vulnerable to another trough in early October, which would mark a 105-day cycle low.   Apple Inc (AAPL.O) again hit an all-time intraday high, up more almost 3 percent to reach $422.86, before easing slightly to $421.24. Wedbush Securities added the stock to its “best ideas” list.

135,IBM,IBM offers concessions to settle EU antitrust probe,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp (IBM) has offered concessions to settle an EU investigation into its business practices, which could allow it to ward off a possible fine and an antitrust infringement finding.  The European Commission opened a probe into IBM in July last year after competing suppliers of mainframe maintenance services accused the U.S.-based company of discriminatory behavior.  A preliminary finding showed IBM’s practices “may amount to a constructive refusal to supply these inputs (required for the maintenance of IBM mainframe hardware and software),” the Commission said in a statement on Tuesday.  “IBM does not agree with the Commission’s preliminary assessment. It has nevertheless offered commitments... to meet the Commission’s competition concerns,” the EU’s executive Commission said.  Antitrust lawyers said a settlement was an easy way for IBM and the regulator to resolve the issue, but that it was difficult to assess the impact on the market.  “If it (the offer) is accepted it’s a win-win situation as IBM doesn’t get fined and the Commission doesn’t have to prove its case,” said Marc Israel, a partner at London-based law firm Macfarlanes. The Commission would also not have to defend a ruling against any appeal that would almost inevitably follow.  “Whether the offer is likely to have any material impact on the maintenance market is an issue the Commission will want to consider, especially if many customers may still prefer to use ‘official’ maintenance contractors,” he said.  IBM offered to provide certain spare parts and technical information to other companies which maintain its mainframe hardware and software under reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions, said the Commission, which acts as competition regulator in the 27-member EU.  The company proposed appointing a manager to handle dealings with other firms. The concessions would last for five years.  EU regulators said third parties now had a month to comment on the proposals. If the proposals were accepted, IBM would not be fined. Penalties for breaking the rules allow for fines of up to 10 percent of global revenues.  The Commission also closed a separate investigation into IBM after three small rivals withdrew their complaints that the firm had tied its mainframe hardware with its operating system.  IBM had said at the time of the allegations that Microsoft and other competitors had inspired the actions by emulator software vendor T3 Technologies Inc. and France’s TurboHercules.  The third complainant was Texas-based Neon Enterprise Software.  IBM welcomed the Commission’s decision on both issues.  “IBM has put in place certain ... parts ordering procedures, and we look forward to that providing the basis for the final resolution,” the company said in a statement.

137,IBM,"In close race for No 1, Deloitte, PwC grow apace","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Forget struggling economies, aggressive regulators, penny-pinching business clients.  The world’s two largest accounting and consulting firms are bulking up with acquisitions and combing the globe for new hires.  Head-to-head in a race for the title of world’s largest private professional services firm, Deloitte and PwC are on a major expansion drive.  With audit revenues leveling off in developed markets, the firms have been making a push in growing countries such as China and India and plowing ahead with investments in consulting, where business is growing after a recessionary slump.  More is at stake than bragging rights. Just as important is cementing their status as professional service supermarkets, able to help clients in almost any market where commerce transpires.  “The more they position themselves as a truly trusted one-stop solution provider to clients, the more they can hope to be more immune to fee pressures from clients that might increase if the economy worsened,” said Ashley Newton, associate director at Kennedy Consulting Research and Advisory.  Last year, a 15 percent jump in the consulting area helped Deloitte overtake PwC as No. 1 in total revenues among the big four global accounting and consulting firms, which also include KPMG and Ernst & Young.  Deloitte claimed the lead by a margin of just $9 million, reporting $26.578 billion revenues to PwC’s $26.569 billion. Prior to 2010, PwC had been the largest for at least five years, according to data from Accounting News Report.  One factor behind the win was Deloitte’s decision to hold on to its consulting arm about a decade ago while other audit firms shed theirs amid concerns of conflict of interest.  The decision helped Deloitte keep its grip on the high-potential area of information technology, a business with good growth prospects even in a dodgy economy. Consulting got a further boost from Deloitte acquisitions such as the government business of BearingPoint in 2009.  Although regulators in the United States and elsewhere have tightened restrictions on the consulting services auditors can provide, consulting has not been prohibited outright, and both Deloitte and PwC have focused their consulting work largely on companies that are not audit clients.  Powerful brand names and close ties with C-suite executives, built partly through audit relationships, have helped make all of the big four formidable competitors in consulting, according to Gartner Research.  “What the audit work does is allow them to create competence in an industry,” building credibility that is a big plus in pulling in consulting work, said Gartner analyst Alex Soejarto.  The move into consulting has been going on for some time, partly because it is far more profitable than mandatory audit work, said Arvind Hickman, editor of International Accounting Bulletin.  “Audit is labor-intensive and has suffered a lot from fee pressure due to the global financial crisis.”  PwC, which sold its consulting arm to IBM in 2002, has been rebuilding its consulting muscle with acquisitions such as Paragon Consulting Group and the commercial services business of BearingPoint in 2009.  Over the past 12 months, it picked up 700 consultants with its purchase of management consulting firm PRTM and hundreds more through its acquisition of Diamond Management & Technology Consultants. Recently it announced it was building its edge in the so-called sustainability or responsible resource use area, by taking on “green” business consultant Andrew Winston as an adviser.  Still the worldwide leader in audit revenues, it also has targeted emerging markets such as India, China and the Middle East to rev up growth.  Deloitte has bought a slew of consulting firms, including energy consultants Altos Management Partners and AJM Petroleum Consultants; performance management advisory firm Jackson Browne; economic consultancy Access Economics and business analytics firm Oco. It also beefed up in the sustainability area, picking up Clear Carbon Consulting and DOMANI Sustainability Consulting.  Full-service clout has helped the firms compete against a range of firms, from management giants such as McKinsey to technology consultants such as IBM Corp (IBM.N) and Accenture (ACN.N).  Both Deloitte and PwC have been hiring nonstop.  PwC said its member firms across the globe hired about 45,000 new staff in the 2011 fiscal year ended in June. Deloitte will not announce its hires until it releases fiscal 2011 revenue figures, but said it was on track with a projection announced last year of 50,000 hires a year globally over the coming five years.  The big four are expected to report their fiscal 2011 revenues in coming weeks and any significant growth will likely once again be in the consulting area, said Jonathan Hamilton, managing editor of Accounting News Report.  “The audit business, while certainly the staple of all these firms, is a slow-growth business,” Hamilton added.  The firms’ growth raises challenges, however, such as assuring quality as their empires expand.  “They are really individual firms that are badged together, but they don’t have a tight centralized control,” said Shan Nair, chief executive of Nair & Co, which advises companies on international expansion and works with the big four firms.  Expansion in China, a key market, has already brought headaches in the audit area. The Chinese arms of both Deloitte and PwC have had to drop clients because of concerns about their accounting and Deloitte’s Shanghai office has been subpoenaed for records by U.S. regulators.  More worries loom from stepped-up regulatory scrutiny. As consulting revenues grow, complaints are surfacing again that firms will be tempted to go easy on audit clients for the sake of winning or keeping a consulting job — a charge the audit firms deny.  Last week, European Union lawmakers approved a report that calls for barring auditors from providing audit and non-audit services to the same client. The report is nonbinding but could shape a draft law in the works.  PwC and Deloitte both said there was no conflict of interest in the consulting services they provide. Much of their consulting is done for companies they do not audit and they follow regulators’ standards and companies’ own restrictions on the kind of consulting they do for audit clients.  PwC also said it follows a code of ethics set by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants to assure its independence.  Also to the firms’ advantage, much of their consulting work — such as helping companies cut costs and become more efficient — should be in demand even if the economy slows, analysts said.  “All-in-all, I’d say they’re generally taking a pretty prudent approach to expansion, even if it is aggressive,” said Newton at Kennedy Consulting Research.

139,IBM,Microsoft boosts dividend 25 percent,"(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp announced a 25 percent increase in its quarterly dividend on Tuesday to 20 cents per share, as the technology giant hands more cash back to shareholders frustrated with its stagnant share price.  The increase, following a 23 percent hike last year, is on the high-end of the range expected by Wall Street, but still may disappoint some investors hoping for a greater payout from Microsoft’s $53 billion pile of cash and short-term investments.  Shares of Microsoft rose 12 cents to $27.10 in extended trading on Tuesday.  The latest increase, payable on December 8 to shareholders of record as of November 15, 2011, means Microsoft’s dividend yield is now about 3 percent.  That puts it in the mid-range of comparable large tech firms, with Intel Corp hovering around 4 percent and IBM Corp at around 1.8 percent. Cisco, which introduced a dividend earlier this year, is at around 1.5 percent. Google Inc and Apple Inc do not pay dividends.  A regular dividend is generally regarded as a mark of a mature company that cannot match earlier growth rates or stock gains, and tends to attract more conservative investors.  Despite explosive growth in the 1990s, Microsoft finds itself in that category, with a share price essentially unchanged for the past decade.  Microsoft, which went public in 1986, paid its first annual dividend in 2003. The following year it issued a special dividend of $3 per share — shelling out more than $30 billion in one go — and started paying a quarterly dividend, which it has raised in increments most years since then.

140,IBM,DEALTALK-Queuing for CoreLogic: one sale or several?," * Two strategic and five private equity players line up   * May have to sell itself piecemeal - analysts   * FDIC suit, management issues could be hurdles    By Aditi Sharma and Rachana Khanzode	   Sept 23 (Reuters) - At least seven firms, mainly private equity, have shown interest in data and analytics company CoreLogic Inc , attracted by its growth businesses and relatively cheap valuations.	   Analysts are divided over whether CoreLogic — which has hired boutique advisory firm Greenhill to explore a possible sale — may be sold whole or in pieces.	   Spun off from First American Corp in June 2010, CoreLogic put itself in the shop window due to a U.S. housing slump that prompted it last month to slash its full-year outlook to below analysts’ expectations.	   At least two strategic buyers and five private equity firms have shown interest in the company, said a source with knowledge of the process. The source, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter, declined to name the companies.	   CoreLogic declined to comment for this article.	   IBM , Infosys , Accenture and Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) were among some names cited by analysts as potential bidders.	   Santa Ana, California-based CoreLogic operates in two segments: business and information services, such as property tax data, flood data, and appraisal and default management; and data and analytics, including property and mortgage securities information, and credit solutions.	   Its second-quarter revenue fell 4 percent year-on-year to $396 million, as a housing slump brought down mortgage originations and hit earnings.	   But the data and analytics business showed continued growth in risk and fraud services.	   “I think their complete business is more valuable than in pieces,” said Morningstar analyst Brett Horn, noting the parts of the business dealing with residential real estate, mortgages and the processing and data market all support each other.	   “Just selling these pieces separately to different buyers is probably not going to be the most effective way to realise their value.”	   CoreLogic shares sank to an 11-year low of $7.64 late last month after the company slashed its outlook, but have since partly recovered on news the company might be sold.  	   The stock last traded at $10.79, but is still down 40 percent year-to-date, underperforming an 11 percent drop on the S&P Midcap Data Processing & Outsources Services sub-index  .	   Some analysts reckon the shares look undervalued because investors have focused on this year’s earnings in isolation.	   One CoreLogic shareholder said, ultimately, it comes down to price.	   “If it’s keen to sell itself for $14 a share and asks shareholders to vote, I’d say ‘No’. But if they say we’re getting a great price, then I’d support it,” said the shareholder, who asked not to be named.	   Private investment firm TPG Capital paid about 11 times EBITDA when it bought MDA DataQuick, a CoreLogic competitor in business and information services, last year.	   That makes it possible for CoreLogic to get 11-12 times its multiple from some private equity firm, the investor said, suggesting a price of above $18 a share.  	   Morningstar’s Horn believes CoreLogic could even fetch a 30 percent premium — around equal to the stock’s trading level just 7 weeks ago.	   “When you look at Lender Processing Services , Fiserv  , Experian , Verisk Analytics , D&B  and Equifax , companies that do the same kind of work, they trade at about 8 times EBITDA, and CoreLogic is priced far below that on a consolidated basis,” the investor said.	   The businesses CoreLogic is most likely to want to sell are the defaults — sitting on record levels of distressed mortgages and expected to drag down overall earnings — and appraisals, said Horn.	   Stephens Inc analyst Carter Malloy said CoreLogic’s unique data and analytics assets, which are showing growth, would likely attract most interest, however.	   “The risk and fraud segment is really the crown jewel, and that’s what I think people are really interested in,” the CoreLogic shareholder said.	   Keeping pace with booming demand for data storage and analytics companies, Teradata Corp this year bought Aster Data for $263 million, and Aprimo for $525 million  , while U.S.-based payment processor FIS had planned to buy UK software firm Misys , but later opted instead for a share buy-back. 	   Tempted bidders will also have to be aware of outstanding issues at CoreLogic.	   Such as the $129 million in damages sought by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) over CoreLogic’s alleged negligence in preparing appraisals for Washington Mutual. 	   “Assuming these disputes remain outstanding, we believe any buyer of CoreLogic would have to be comfortable taking on this potential liability,” said Greg Smith, analyst at Sterne Agee.	   CoreLogic shareholders are also pressing for management changes as the company went six months without a chief financial officer.	   CoreLogic, which has been divesting non-core assets, sold its employer services and litigation support business last December , and was paid $50 million in July by Cognizant Technology Solutions for its India-based CoreLogic Global Services Pvt Ltd unit.

141,IBM,FASB Chair: Slow switch would smooth rule change," * SEC studies adding international accounting rules   * Problems would “fall aside” - Seidman   By Ross Kerber   BOSTON, Sept 26 (Reuters) - A gradual switch to international accounting standards would mitigate some concerns over the new rules, the chair of the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board said on Monday.   If U.S. regulators decide to slowly merge the board’s standards and the international rules being developed by the International Accounting Standards Board, then issues such as certain tax matters and how to manage bonus payments “fall aside,” Leslie Seidman, the FASB’s chair, said at a conference sponsored by the Council of Institutional Investors in Boston.   The details matter because the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is deciding whether to adopt the international rules, to make it easier to compare U.S. and foreign companies — and if so, whether to simply adopt the rules at once or slowly incorporate some or all of them.   Among their differences, the international rules have fewer specialized standards for certain industries such as casinos and airlines. The U.S. rules also allow different types of inventory accounting. The two bodies had hoped to harmonize their major standards by the summer of 2011, but have now pushed some of those goals to sometime in 2012.   The SEC already allows some foreign private issuers to make U.S. filings under the international standards without reconciling them to the standards formulated by Seidman’s group, known as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Some big multinationals like Ford Motor Co (F.N) and IBM (IBM.N) already use the international accounting standards for their foreign operations.   However, some investors worry that broad changes to GAAP could prove to be expensive for U.S. corporations domestically, and for their auditors and law firms. In an informal poll at the Boston conference, which was attended by several hundred professionals including many who manage public pension funds, two thirds — 66 percent — said they were “concerned” or “very concerned” that a change to the new standards could beexpensive. Many also said they had more confidence in the current GAAP rules.   Others said there was some value to the new rules, as a way to promote transparency, and that a fast shift may be the best way to save costs.   “It should be done (quickly), otherwise I think it will just drag out,” Erik Sebusch, a partner at San Francisco private-equity firm CMEA Capital, said in an interview during a break in the conference.   Seidman’s international counterpart Hans Hoogervorst, chair of the IASB, also spoke at the panel and promoted his group’s guidelines as a way to fairly value companies worldwide.   “At this moment, the only standard that has the potential to become a truly global standard is IFRS,” he said, using the acronym for the IASB’s International Financial Reporting Standards.   Seidman cautioned the decision on what standard U.S. companies should use is up to regulators and not to the FASB, which serves only an advisory role. Were regulators to decide to use the foreign guidelines, it would be better to merge, or “incorporate” them rather than fully adopt them, to smooth the transition.   “Some sort of an incorporation approach is more appropriate,” she said.

142,IBM,Tech firms to invest $4.4 bln in upstate New York," ALBANY, N.Y., Sept 27 (Reuters) - A group of five technology firms will invest $4.4 billion in New York State in an effort to develop a new generation of computer chips, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced on Tuesday.  The companies which signed an agreement with New York are Intel (INTC.O), IBM (IBM.N), GLOBALFOUNDRIES [CSMF.UL], TSMC (2330.TW) and Samsung (005930.KS).   The investment could keep or create about 7,000 jobs upstate, Cuomo said in a statement, adding that no private company would receive any state funds.   “This unprecedented private investment in New York’s economy will create thousands of jobs and make the state the epicenter for the next generation of computer chip technology,” Cuomo said.   Under an agreement between the state and the firms, New York will kick in $400 million over five years to the State University of New York’s College for Nanoscale and Science Engineering (CNSE) in Albany.   The state’s investment will be directed entirely to CNSE, and all tools and equipment acquired will be owned by CNSE.   New research and development facilities will be located in Albany, Canandaigua, Utica, East Fishkill and Yorktown Heights.   Two projects make up most of the investment. The first will focus on making the next generation of computer chips while the second will focus on changing existing production over to the new technology.   Tuesday’s announcement came as 10 newly created regional development councils began to debate economic development initiative ideas. On a radio show on Monday, Cuomo said “plans with a high degree of predictability” would be rewarded with grants and tax credits.

143,IBM,"UPDATE 1-Lenovo in $300 mln JV with Compal, shares jump"," * Lenovo to own 51 pct of JV, Compal the remainder   * Lenovo jumps 8.5 pct, Compal up 6 pct at 1-mth high   * JV is first between PC brand and contract manufacturer   (Adds details)	   By Lee Chyen Yee and Argin Chang	   HONG KONG/TAIPEI, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Lenovo Group Ltd  , the world’s No.3 PC brand, has entered into a $300 million venture with contract laptop PC maker Compal Electronics Inc in eastern China, the companies said, pushing their shares up sharply.	   Lenovo rose as much as 8.5 percent in Hong Kong, while in Taiwan Compal rose 5.9 percent to a more than one-month high before pulling back slightly, after the companies announced their plan to form what analysts said was the first joint venture between a PC brand and a contract manufacturer.	   Lenovo will own 51 percent of joint venture Lienpal (Hefei) Ltd, with Compal, the world’s No.2 contract PC maker, holding the remainder, the companies said in separate statements. 	   “The joint venture shows the close relationship between Lenovo and Compal, but with this venture I think Compal’s other clients such as Dell Inc and Acer Inc will be concerned,” said Daiwa Securities analyst Jenny Shih.	   Analysts said that in the short run Compal would benefit from the agreement, although there could be some long-term uncertainty over client loyalty.	   “There are certain risks in such a cooperation as it could mean the plant relies only on orders from Lenovo,” said KGI Securities analyst Angela Hsiang. “On the other hand, the deal will allow Compal to secure production from a key client.”	   Both companies will invest $100 million initially followed by an additional $200 million over the subsequent 18 months, depending on business climate and capacity expansion.	   Lienpal would begin full-scale manufacturing of Lenovo laptop and desktop PCs by the end of 2012, the companies said.	   The deal will help secure Lenovo’s production as it seeks to increase its global market share.	   In early September, Lenovo Chairman Liu Chuanzi said Lenovo expected to surpass Dell to become the second-largest seller of personal computers in the world by the end of the year. 	   “Lenovo has made a lot of investments lately, including in Japan and Germany, to capture market share in emerging markets. The deal with Compal will allow it to secure production lines and have better control over output,” said Bank of China International analyst Michael Meng.	   Lenovo, which ranks behind industry leader Hewlett-Packard Co and Dell in the global PC sector with a 12.2 percent market share in the second quarter, bought Germany’s Medion AG  in June, in its biggest acquisition since purchasing International Business Machines Corp’s PC unit six years ago.	   Earlier this year, it formed a joint venture with NEC Corp  to sell laptops in Japan.	   Compal said in a separate announcement on Tuesday that it planned to invest $31.8 million in Ascendant Private Equity Investment as a long-term investment.

144,IBM,"Microsoft CEO bonus lags on phone, tablet results","SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp Chief Executive Steve Ballmer failed to clinch his maximum bonus for the second year running due to the company’s slow progress in mobile phones and adapting to the tablet computer revolution.  Ballmer, 55, got a bonus of $682,500 for the latest fiscal year, matching his annual salary, according to a filing with securities regulators on Monday. Under his bonus scheme, he was eligible to receive between zero and double his salary.  The long-time CEO, who took over from Bill Gates in 2000, has been a lightning rod for criticism of the former technology leader’s static share price. One prominent shareholder called for his ouster this year, but he shows no signs of stepping down.  Last year, Ballmer also received a bonus equaling his salary, and was faulted for the failure of the Kin phone and keeping up with new forms of computing.  Microsoft’s latest filing said Ballmer’s performance review for fiscal 2011 — which ended June 30 — took into account lower than expected sales of Windows Phone 7 software and “the need for further progress in new form factors,” a reference to Microsoft’s inability to counter runaway sales of Apple Inc’s iPad.  It also pointed to a 2 percent dip in sales at its key Windows unit, which was in line with global personal computer sales, but also shows that Apple’s tablet is starting to eat away at the core PC market.  Microsoft is not expected to enter the tablet market in earnest until next year, when it releases its next operating system, code-named Windows 8.  In Ballmer’s favor, the company’s compensation committee recognized his success in launching the Kinect hands-free gaming system for Xbox and the online Office 365 product, while building up the Azure cloud computing platform and Bing search engine.  It also mentioned his work toward the purchase of online chat company Skype, which has not yet been completed, and partnerships with Facebook and phone maker Nokia.  LOW-PAID CEO  Ballmer has long requested that he receive no stock compensation, which might otherwise boost his pay packet. He already owns 3.95 percent of the company’s shares and is the 33rd richest person in the world with a fortune of $14.5 billion, according to Forbes.  Overall, Ballmer’s compensation rose only about 2 percent from last year to $1.38 million, making him one of the lowest-paid leaders of a major U.S. company.  Microsoft’s filing pegs Ballmer’s maximum possible compensation — if he had received twice his salary in bonus — at about $2 million, compared to an average of $15.8 million for CEOs of peer companies. In the filing, Microsoft said its board believes Ballmer is “underpaid for his role and performance,” but accepted his request to receive no stock.  Ballmer’s small pay rise comes as the company increases its sales, but is struggling to keep pace with the innovation of Apple, which is now bigger in terms of sales, profit and market value. In May, Microsoft’s old foe IBM also surpassed its market value for the first time since 1996.  During Microsoft’s last fiscal year, its sales rose 12 percent to almost $70 billion and its operating profit rose 13 percent to $27 billion, helped by strong performance from its Office unit.  Microsoft’s shares gained 13 percent in that time, compared to a 31 percent gain in the tech-heavy Nasdaq, but have retreated since. The stock closed at $24.53 on the Nasdaq on Monday, around the same level as a decade ago.

147,IBM,IBM buys Q1 Labs to expand in security software,"(Reuters) - IBM Corp (IBM.N) will buy security software provider Q1 Labs as it looks to expand in a market which has seen recent high-profile cyber attacks on victims from Sony Corp (6758.T) to the British police.  Last year, Intel Corp (INTC.O) paid $7.68 billion for data security firm McAfee Inc, and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N) bought security software company ArcSight Inc for $1.5 billion.  Also on Tuesday, McAfee said it would buy NitroSecurity, a privately-owned provider of security information and event management tools. NitroSecurity and Q1 Labs, which is also privately owned, make software to help businesses analyze security logs and spot hacking threats and attacks.  IBM, which did not say how much it was paying for Q1 Labs, sees the security software and services business as a $94 billion market opportunity and has been buying analytics companies to beef up its security offerings.  In five years, it has spent more than $14 billion on 25 deals focused on analytics to help customers deal with the huge volumes of unstructured data from sources such as social media, biometrics and criminal databases.  In August, it bought British security analytics software firm i2, also for an undisclosed sum, and last month acquired Toronto-based risk analytics software firm Algorithmics for $387 million in cash.  Symantec Corp (SYMC.O), with a 19 percent share, dominated the global security software market — worth $14.7 billion by revenue — last year, according to research firm Gartner.

150,IBM,HOW TO PLAY IT- Run from the bear or grin at it," ISSUE: The stock market dropped briefly into bear market territory on Monday. What does an investor do while the market flirts with a big drop?   By Manuela Badawy   NEW YORK, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Wall Street started the week under a foreboding shadow.   The Standard & Poor’s 500 index extended a three-month downward spiral to a total loss of 20 percent — a level at which many technical analysts declare a bear market, and from which stocks often fall into a longer, deeper retrenchment.   While the market has staged a strong rebound since, optimism is in short supply as Europe tilts toward recession, Greece toward default and the United States toward more sluggish economic growth. Equity fund withdrawals are at their highest rate since the 2008 financial crisis.   Here are views on what to do while waiting to see if the bear is back in hibernation or ready for action once again:   Some strategists see the present levels as tempting. The market has been swinging back and forth over a wide range and some see it continuing to rebound.  “We did sell in early August when momentum broke down, but we are looking for an entry point,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Bank with $55 billion in assets.   A bear market is supposed to kick in when an index such as Standard & Poor’s SPX.N falls 20 percent from a high. On Monday, stocks rebounded late in the day, avoiding the bear status, albeit just barely.   Many are skeptical about reading too much into the numbers.   But there clearly is a pattern: Seven of the eight times the S&P has closed with a 20-percent cumulative loss, stocks have fallen further over the next year and sometimes by a lot more.   However the market plays out, cash-rich corporate America has enough of a cushion to pay dividends — even in a recession, says Colin Moore, chief investment officer at Columbia Management Investment Advisers, with $362 billion in assets under management.   Indeed, dividend hikes are still possible. Companies are paying out 30 percent of their cash, which is historically low, especially in a business climate where managers see few places to put cash to work.   “The amount of dividend paid should be closer to 40 percent to 45 percent,” Moore said.   Moore’s Columbia Dividend Income Fund (LBSAX.O) top holdings are International Business Machines (IBM.N), Philip Morris (PM.N), Verizon Communications (VZ.N), Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and AT&T (T.N).   In a full-on bear market, all equities suffer. But to reduce risk exposure, strategists suggest looking at companies like consumer staples firms, which are less prone to recession.   Food and beverages are “products that we need in our everyday lives irrespective of whether we are in recession or not,” said John De Clue, senior vice president at US bank, with $113 billion in assets.   Healthcare is a classic defensive area because while these companies are influenced by the state of the economy, they depend more on the regulatory environment, De Clue said.   Bernie Williams, money manager for USAA who oversees $4 billion in discretionary assets from high net worth individuals, cites Sysco (SYY.N), Chevron (CVX.N) and McDonalds’ (MCD.N) as good defensive holdings.   Treasury yields have sunk so low they have lost their appeal for many income-driven investors. Two to three percent yields seem like small beans given the recent U.S. debt downgrade and the chance that monetary stimulus might boost inflation.   Investment-grade bonds, by comparison, have managed to hold higher yields and credit quality has remained reasonably high in some sectors.   It’s not hard to find four percent corporate bond yields, which offer more than twice the yield of the U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury note of 1.89 percent.   Some strategists are looking at high-yield bonds — but they advise caution since the  high-yield sector tends to do worse in slowdowns than higher-rated fixed income.   Still, mutual funds or Exchange Traded Funds that carry these assets can return a yield of up to 8 percent.   “That’s darned attractive,” says Bernie Williams, money manager for USAA who oversees $4 billion in discretionary assets from high net worth individuals.   Williams cited two funds with close to an 8 percent yield, USAA High Yield Opportunities Fund USHYX and an ETF, iShares iBoxx HY Corp Bond Fund (HYG).   The perception is that emerging market investing is one of the riskiest categories. But since China and Brazil have become net creditors, and with robust economic growth in many emerging economies, some fund managers say this sector is worth looking at — even when “risk” assets are being dumped.   Some even see it as a safe haven in with U.S. and European markets in upheaval.   “If you look at the pull-back in price, it is an attractive buying opportunity,” said Thomas Wilson, senior investment manager of the institutional investment group at Brinker Capital with $12 billion in assets.  “Europe looks very cheap but you are playing with politics,” Williams said. “One strategy is to wait for the news of the (Greek) default and then go in.”  ",10062011,http://www.reuters.com/article/howtoplay-bearmarket/how-to-play-it-run-from-the-bear-or-grin-at-it-idUSN1E7940UQ20111006

Equity fund withdrawals are at their highest rate since the 2008 financial crisis.  Here are views on what to do while waiting to see if the bear is back in hibernation or ready for action once again:  Some strategists see the present levels as tempting. The market has been swinging back and forth over a wide range and some see it continuing to rebound.  “We did sell in early August when momentum broke down, but we are looking for an entry point,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Bank with $55 billion in assets.  A bear market is supposed to kick in when an index such as Standard & Poor’s falls 20 percent from a high. On Monday, stocks rebounded late in the day, avoiding the bear status, albeit just barely.  Many are skeptical about reading too much into the numbers.  But there clearly is a pattern: Seven of the eight times the S&P has closed with a 20-percent cumulative loss, stocks have fallen further over the next year and sometimes by a lot more.  However the market plays out, cash-rich corporate America has enough of a cushion to pay dividends — even in a recession, says Colin Moore, chief investment officer at Columbia Management Investment Advisers, with $362 billion in assets under management.  Indeed, dividend hikes are still possible. Companies are paying out 30 percent of their cash, which is historically low, especially in a business climate where managers see few places to put cash to work.  “The amount of dividend paid should be closer to 40 percent to 45 percent,” Moore said.  Moore likes Columbia Dividend Income Fund top holdings are International Business Machines, Philip Morris, Verizon Communications, Exxon Mobil and AT&T.  In a full-on bear market, all equities suffer. But to reduce risk exposure, strategists suggest looking at companies like consumer staples firms, which are less prone to recession.  Food and beverages are “products that we need in our everyday lives irrespective of whether we are in recession or not,” said John De Clue, senior vice president at US bank, with $113 billion in assets.  Healthcare is a classic defensive area because while these companies are influenced by the state of the economy, they depend more on the regulatory environment, De Clue said.  Bernie Williams, money manager for USAA who oversees $4 billion in discretionary assets from high net worth individuals, cites Sysco, Chevron and McDonalds’ as good defensive holdings.  Treasury yields have sunk so low they have lost their appeal for many income-driven investors. Two to three percent yields seem like small beans given the recent U.S. debt downgrade and the chance that monetary stimulus might boost inflation.  Investment-grade bonds, by comparison, have managed to hold higher yields and credit quality has remained reasonably high in some sectors.  It’s not hard to find four percent corporate bond yields, which offer more than twice the yield of the U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury note of 1.89 percent.  Some strategists are looking at high-yield bonds — but they advise caution since the high-yield sector tends to do worse in slowdowns than higher-rated fixed income.  Still, mutual funds or Exchange Traded Funds that carry these assets can return a yield of up to 8 percent.  “That’s darned attractive,” says Bernie Williams, money manager for USAA who oversees $4 billion in discretionary assets from high net worth individuals.  Williams cited two funds with close to an 8 percent yield, USAA High Yield Opportunities Fund and an ETF, iShares iBoxx HY Corp Bond Fund.  The perception is that emerging market investing is one of the riskiest categories. But since China and Brazil have become net creditors, and with robust economic growth in many emerging economies, some fund managers say this sector is worth looking at — even when “risk” assets are being dumped.  Some even see it as a safe haven in with U.S. and European markets in upheaval.  “If you look at the pull-back in price, it is an attractive buying opportunity,” said Thomas Wilson, senior investment manager of the institutional investment group at Brinker Capital with $12 billion in assets.  “Europe looks very cheap but you are playing with politics,” Williams said. “One strategy is to wait for the news of the (Greek) default and then go in.”  ",10062011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-howtoplay-bearmarket/how-to-play-it-run-from-the-bear-or-grin-at-it-idUSTRE7956AV20111006
152,IBM,Marketers struggle to harness social media: survey,"LONDON (Reuters) - Marketing chiefs feel overwhelmed by the growing volume of customer data on websites like Facebook and Twitter, and while they realize its potential value they consider themselves ill-equipped to harness it, an IBM study found. Only 26 percent of chief marketing officers track blogs and just 40 percent track any online communications, while 82 percent still rely on traditional market research to shape marketing strategies, according to the study. A few top consumer brands, such as Coca-Cola, Nike and Starbucks — are using high-profile social media campaigns to great effect to find out what their customers want and to communicate with them. But most CMOs are struggling to prove that investments in social media marketing would yield returns, according to the survey of more than 1,700 CMOs published on Tuesday and carried out in face-to-face interviews from February to June. “The perfect solution is to serve each consumer individually. The problem? There are 7 billion of them,” said one CMO at a consumer-products firm in the survey. Some 82 percent said they planned to increase their use of social media over the next 3-5 years. IBM, along with other technology firms and big advertising agencies, is seeking to capitalize on the need of marketers to analyze data being created and shared on sites like Twitter and YouTube or by email. Facebook has more than 800 million active users, while Twitter users send about 200 million tweets per day. Such unstructured data, which are not collected in databases or documents, are difficult to understand using traditional computer programs. IBM estimated that more than 90 percent of all real-time information being created today are unstructured — and has spent $14 billion in the past five years on acquisitions of analytics companies to fulfill that new demand. “We have entered the age of the smarter consumer,” IBM marketing executive Marcel Holsheimer told journalists at a briefing in London. “Marketing is going to become much more an automated and software play than it was in the past.

154,IBM,Wall St Week Ahead: S&P; 500 index poised to extend streak,"* S&P; 500 closes above key 1,220 level * Apple, IBM hit life closing highs before earnings * Ten blue chips to report quarterly results next week By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, Oct 14 (Reuters) - With one-third of the Dow components and crowd favorite, Apple, reporting results next week, U.S. stocks are setting the stage for another week of gains. After the steepest two-week rally in more than two years, the S&P; 500 is at the top end of its range for the past two months. The benchmark closed Friday above 1,220 for the first time since early August, and bets against the recent rally could start to pile up. But Monday earnings and guidance from IBM , followed by results from Apple , Coca-Cola and Intel on Tuesday could give shorts a reason to put their guns down. The S&P; could be on its way to a third straight winning week —a streak not seen since February. “There are some fundamental catalysts which could play right into the momentum,” said Richard Ross, global technical strategist for Auerbach Grayson in New York. He said the S&P; 500 “has potential to take out that well defined resistance (at 1,220) and it would be a fast move up to the next level, between 1,265 and 1,275.” The sharp turnaround in stocks from a 2011 low hit Tuesday took many by surprise, and buying has spurred more buying as traders and money managers try to catch up with the benchmark’s performance. The pattern repeated itself Friday, with the three major indexes closing at or near session highs. For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average  gained 4.9 percent, the S&P; 500 added 6 percent, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 7.6 percent. Ten of the 30 Dow components, including Microsoft , American Express and Johnson & Johnson , are scheduled to report quarterly results next week. Big financial names expected to report include Citigroup , Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo , which follow Thursday’s earnings disappointment from JPMorgan Chase & Co that battered the sector. Reported and estimated earnings growth for the current earnings season is seen at 12.4 percent for all S&P; 500 companies, according to Thomson Reuters data. That is down from this year’s estimate peak of 17 percent in July. But companies like Apple and IBM, which hit lifetime closing highs on Friday, are expected to trounce expectations. And positive surprises could play into the buying momentum. “Price will start to discount even more optimism,” said Wasif Latif, vice president of equity investments at the San Antonio, Texas-based USAA Investment Management, which manages about $45 billion in mutual funds. “Growth companies, given the high expectations, need to have a ‘wow’ factor when it comes to reporting and beating earnings,” he said, adding it was certainly possible for these two names to rise further. The VIX volatility gauge has declined in the past weeks, closing on Friday at its lowest level since Aug. 3. That could translate into less uncertainty and more of the buying frenzy that drove the S&P; 500 to its largest two-week percentage advance since mid 2009. ECONOMY: LESS BAD THAN FEARED Softening economic numbers in the United States and abroad, as well as a grinding expansion of the euro zone sovereign debt crisis, stymied investors and drove stocks and commodity prices to heavy losses in the third quarter. But despite Greece’s slow crawl toward a default and rising borrowing costs in Spain and Italy, the perception of efficient action in Europe gave investors the confidence to return to equities —or at least cover their short bets. Economic numbers, expected at a certain point in the summer to show the U.S. economy was sliding back into recession, have generally come in above those lowered estimates. USAA’s Latif said that even if current levels are subdued and expectations are lowered “it’s definitely very encouraging” to have data land better than expected. Among the main economic indicators due next week are industrial production and capacity utilization on Monday; producer and consumer inflation on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively; and weekly jobless claims on Thursday.

155,IBM,PREVIEW-Cloud spending helps techs as PC sales stagger,"* IBM, Intel, Apple, Microsoft report next week * Cloud computing seen as big driver in down economy * PC sales limp along, hurts Microsoft, hardware makers By Bill Rigby and Noel Randewich Oct 14 (Reuters) - Big U.S. Internet computing companies should outshine their plainer PC cousins when earnings season kicks off next week, as corporations and fast-growing Web players dramatically accelerate their pace of hardware spending. Corporations are increasingly turning to new technology to make themselves more productive in a downtrodden global economy. Meanwhile, a social networking and e-commerce boom is spurring massive outlays on the giant server factories that power Internet computing. That’s good news for Intel Corp , which is supplying more of its microchips direct to companies building their own servers, and firms like EMC Corp and VMware whose businesses are integral to the storage and transmission of remote data, known as “cloud computing”. But it is less of a boon for traditional hardware makers such as Dell Inc and Hewlett Packard Co , which find themselves selling PCs at low margins and struggling to cope with an accelerating migration to smartphones and tablets. “The area of strength is still data centers, the cloud,” said Kevin Cassidy, chip analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “You have Facebook building out their data centers ... five football fields large.” Facebook, like online leaders Amazon.com and China’s Baidu , is buying masses of equipment to fill two major data centers in Oregon and North Carolina, but going straight to component makers like Intel for parts, rather than buying whole servers from HP or IBM . “It’s server demand, specifically emerging-market server demand,” said Evercore Partners analyst Patrick Wang, identifying growth areas. “Companies tied to the cloud and data centers are doing relatively better, there’s no question.” Apple Inc , which reports on Tuesday, continues to defy the economy and astound Wall Street by luring ever more consumers to buy its newest gadgets. But most other hardware companies are limping along, with little sign of a revival ahead. Worldwide PC sales barely rose more than 3 percent last quarter over last year’s numbers, according to the major research firms, as consumers stick with old machines or buy smartphones and tablets instead. Gartner last month cut its annual PC sales growth forecast to 3.8 percent, down from its previous projection of 9.3 percent. “I would not want to be in the hardware business right now,” said Michael Yoshikami, CEO of fund manager YCMNET Advisors. “Cloud companies are going to continue to accelerate, but PC companies generally are going to continue to suffer.” The knock-on effect hurts Intel’s traditional business of supplying chips for PCs, but it especially hits Microsoft Corp , which still relies on PC sales to keep its core Windows and Office products growing, despite making recent inroads into the cloud market with its server software and Azure developer platform. “I expect little or no growth from the consumer and I just want to know that companies are still spending for the refurbishment of the existing PC fleet,” said Kim Forrest, senior analyst at money manager Fort Pitt Capital Group, on Microsoft’s outlook. “If you are not hiring people, you don’t need to buy that extra PC. If it’s still kind of working, you’ll suffer through till the company has more money.” Wall Street is expecting a modest 9 percent rise in IBM’s quarterly net profit when it reports on Monday, and a 6 percent rise from Microsoft on Thursday. Intel, reporting on Tuesday, is expected to post a 12 percent increase. Apple, launching sales of its newest iPhone on Friday, is expected to post a whopping 57 percent jump in net profit. Only the smaller cloud-focused tech companies look close to rivaling that kind of growth rate. VMware, the small but fast-growing leader in projecting or “virtualizing” operating systems onto computers via the Internet, also reports earnings on Monday, with analysts’ predicting a 30 percent jump in net profit. “VMware is making a legitimate move to become the next major enterprise software stack,” said Jefferies & Co analyst Ross MacMillan, in a research note to clients earlier this month, putting a “buy” recommendation on the stock. “It is a bold strategy, but one with significant rewards if successful,” said MacMillan. The world’s biggest data storage equipment company, EMC, which owns the majority of VMware, reports on Tuesday, with analysts expecting a 27 percent jump in net profit. “I think companies with higher exposure to the cloud will do better,” said Cassidy at Stifel Nicolaus, citing small newcomers like Mellanox Technologies Ltd , which builds high-end networks connecting servers and storage devices. “You build these new high-speed servers and you need to have highways or networks that keep them connected at higher speeds.”",10142011,http://www.reuters.com/article/technology-earnings/preview-cloud-spending-helps-techs-as-pc-sales-stagger-idUSN1E79D0OG20111014

158,IBM,"IBM's Q3 disappoints, stock drops","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - IBM’s quarterly results failed to impress investors used to a stellar showing from Big Blue, dragging its stock down more than 3 percent. Revenue and service signings roughly met forecasts, but paled in comparison with strong results in recent weeks from Oracle Corp and Accenture Plc that had fueled an IBM stock rally to an all-time high on Friday. The information technology hardware bellwether, with its global span and diverse clientele, said total services signings — an indicator of future growth — climbed to $12.3 billion in the third quarter, at the low end of expectations of $12 billion to $13 billion. Revenue rose 8 percent to $26.2 billion, marginally softer than the average forecast of $26.26 billion. “We’re in the early stages of third-quarter earnings season and everyone’s looking at top-line numbers to see any evidence of the economic slowdown working its way into financial results,” said Keith Wirtz, chief investment officer for Fifth Third Asset Management. “All the news on macro has been negative. At what point does it creep into the company numbers? We’re still seeing above-average results.” Buttressed by recurring revenue that helps keep IBM’s results steady in strong and weak economies, its shares have outperformed the market and hit a record high last week. They are up about 28 percent this year versus the Standard & Poor’s 500 index’s 4 percent dip. International Business Machines Corp’s results on Monday triggered profit-taking. The stock, which closed at an all-time high of $190.53 on Friday, fell 3.7 percent to $179.70 in extended trade after closing down 2.1 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. “The company exceeded published expectations, but the underlying expectations were even higher,” Annex Research analyst Bob Djurdjevic said. “Investors who have been very bullish on IBM are probably taking some profits now.” U.S. economic concerns and a worsening European financial crisis have hurt consumer demand. Companies such as IBM that sell hardware and software for data centers powering the Internet have remained resilient. IBM said revenue from cloud computing in the first nine months of this year was twice as much as in full-year 2010. Business software maker VMware Inc, also a major player in cloud computing, on Monday posted quarterly profit above expectations but warned of uncertainty among some of its corporate customers in Europe. “We have seen a bit more scrutiny and higher levels of approval required. Particularly with larger deals where they would go for CFO and CEO approval, where in the past we may not have seen those approvals to be necessary,” said VMWare Chief Financial Officer Mark Peeking. IBM also derives a major portion of its revenue from government spending and the financial services industry — both hit hard by widening fiscal deficits and crumbling markets, respectively. “There isn’t much happiness with these numbers. The software number is up 13 percent, but adjusted for currency, it was up 8 percent. That’s a little disappointing,” said Richard Sichel, chief investment officer for Philadelphia Trust Co. IBM has consistently beaten Wall Street forecasts. In the second quarter, it trounced expectations with signings of new business surging 16 percent. At the time, that stellar performance raised hopes that 2011 would be a good year for overall tech-spending. On Monday, it raised its full-year diluted earnings forecast to at least $13.35 per share, from its prior estimate of at least $13.25. But that was just pennies above the Wall Street target of $13.32, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. IBM reported a third-quarter profit, excluding items, of $3.28 per share, up 15 percent year over year, just pennies above expectations for $3.22. “Whatever IBM could control, they did a great job. But they are not immune to macro conditions. Financial conditions are tough,” said Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry. “People don’t want to cancel projects, but projects are getting delayed. Sales cycles are getting elongated. New projects are getting smaller budgets.” Despite uncertainty in the fourth quarter and 2012, some portfolio managers remained confident in IBM’s ability to weather a tougher global environment. “IBM’s business has a degree of resiliency to it. The company has maintenance agreements that generate recurring revenue, giving us more visibility on future results,” Wirtz said.

The stock, which closed at an all-time high of $190.53 on Friday, fell 3.7 percent to $179.70 in extended trade after closing down 2.1 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. “The company exceeded published expectations, but the underlying expectations were even higher,” Annex Research analyst Bob Djurdjevic said. “Investors who have been very bullish on IBM are probably taking some profits now.” U.S. economic concerns and a worsening European financial crisis have hurt consumer demand. Companies such as IBM that sell hardware and software for data centers powering the Internet have remained resilient. IBM said revenue from cloud computing in the first nine months of this year was twice as much as in full-year 2010. Business software maker VMware Inc, also a major player in cloud computing, on Monday posted quarterly profit above expectations but warned of uncertainty among some of its corporate customers in Europe. “We have seen a bit more scrutiny and higher levels of approval required. Particularly with larger deals where they would go for CFO and CEO approval, where in the past we may not have seen those approvals to be necessary,” said VMWare Chief Financial Officer Mark Peeking. IBM also derives a major portion of its revenue from government spending and the financial services industry — both hit hard by widening fiscal deficits and crumbling markets, respectively. “There isn’t much happiness with these numbers. The software number is up 13 percent, but adjusted for currency, it was up 8 percent. That’s a little disappointing,” said Richard Sichel, chief investment officer for Philadelphia Trust Co. IBM has consistently beaten Wall Street forecasts. In the second quarter, it trounced expectations with signings of new business surging 16 percent. At the time, that stellar performance raised hopes that 2011 would be a good year for overall tech-spending. On Monday, it raised its full-year diluted earnings forecast to at least $13.35 per share, from its prior estimate of at least $13.25. But that was just pennies above the Wall Street target of $13.32, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. IBM reported a third-quarter profit, excluding items, of $3.28 per share, up 15 percent year over year, just pennies above expectations for $3.22. “Whatever IBM could control, they did a great job. But they are not immune to macro conditions. Financial conditions are tough,” said Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry. “People don’t want to cancel projects, but projects are getting delayed. Sales cycles are getting elongated. New projects are getting smaller budgets.” Despite uncertainty in the fourth quarter and 2012, some portfolio managers remained confident in IBM’s ability to weather a tougher global environment. “IBM’s business has a degree of resiliency to it. The company has maintenance agreements that generate recurring revenue, giving us more visibility on future results,” Wirtz said.

161,IBM,IBM shares fall as tech-spend worries loom,"(Reuters) - Shares of IBM fell 5 percent in pre-market trading on Tuesday after Big Blue’s third-quarter beat failed to stem worries about a slowdown in tech spending. International Business Machines also increased its 2011 profit outlook but that fell short of high investor expectations after recent strong reports from Oracle and Accenture. New deals at IBM’s global technology services business fell below some Wall Street expectations, increasing the need for strong deal signings in the fourth quarter, Collins Stewart said in a research note. The brokerage said customers may be deferring new projects because of the uncertain macroeconomic environment that may become more evident in 2012, but added that IBM’s trends were somewhat of a positive for the technology sector overall. IBM, an information technology hardware bellwether with a global clientele, said total services signings — an indicator of future growth — climbed to $12.3 billion in the third quarter, in line with expectations. The company’s recurring revenue also cushions it from hitting a low when business slows and has helped its shares outperform the market. “IBM’s software results are consistent with our thesis that software companies will report good 3Q11 (third quarter) results despite recent macro weakness though with some evidence of slowing,” Collins Stewart said. BofA Merrill Lynch said it expected the blue chip to cut costs further, given the slowdown in IT spending. “Longer term, we view IBM as a share winner in the IT spending market,” the brokerage said in a note. BofA Merrill, which expects IBM to ramp up its software and services products and boost revenue through acquisitions, raised its price target to $205 from $190. Citigroup said though the third quarter results would not boost the shares in the near term, IBM remained on track to deliver low double-digit earnings-per-share growth despite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. Shares of the company were down at $178.10 in trading before the bell. They closed at $186.59 on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.

166,IBM,IBM taps Rometty to succeed Palmisano as CEO,"(Reuters) - IBM global sales chief Virginia Rometty will take over as CEO from Sam Palmisano in January, becoming one of the most powerful women in business and technology today. In taking the helm of the storied industry icon, she makes it the largest U.S. corporation by value to be headed by a woman. IBM, which over the decades had a reputation of being a strait-laced, plodding, male-dominated business empire, will formally appoint the 54-year-old engineering and computer science graduate its first female CEO on January 1. The selection went down well with Silicon Valley and Wall Street, especially because the 60-year-old Palmisano — who helped transform Big Blue from a computer hardware company into a global services and software behemoth — is staying on as chairman. “Given Ginni’s experience running the largest portion of the business by revenue, she was a logical choice,” said Macquarie Securities analyst Brad Zelnick. Her ascension will set up a rivalry with Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman for the mantle of most powerful woman in technology, mirroring a long-running rivalry between the two companies. Rometty joins a relatively small circle of top female CEOs, including Whitman, Pepsico’s Indra Nooyi, Xerox’s Ursula Burns, Kraft Foods’ Irene Rosenfeld and DuPont’s Ellen Kullman. Rometty — who most recently served as senior vice president of global sales — made her mark with the smooth 2002 integration of PriceWaterhouseCooper’s consulting arm, a landmark move that catapulted IBM into the upper echelons of the technology consulting business. Colleagues say that Rometty, often clad in elegant pastel-colored suits, cut a striking figure in IBM’s staid hallways and impressed co-workers with both her cool-headedness and enthusiasm. “She exudes energy,” said Nelson Fraiman, professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Business. Fraiman, who has known the computer science and electrical engineering graduate from Northwestern for about a decade, said she was a good strategist and an early advocate for IBM’s expansion into business analytics, or tools and services that help companies quickly analyze trends. “She thinks in a very analytical way. That’s part of her engineering training,” he said. One former IBM executive said Rometty — who sometimes carries a backpack rather than a briefcase — worked long hours and demanded that her subordinates do the same. “People who work for her just don’t sleep,” said the source. “She has a style that is very different from anybody else’s, but is all her own.” In nine years as IBM’s leader, Palmisano exited low-margin businesses including PCs, printers and hard drives. He expanded the company’s offerings in services, consulting and software. Since the former history major took the reins, Big Blue’s stock has outperformed HP’s and matched Oracle’s, according to Thomson Reuters data. Wall Street appeared to approve of the choice of Rometty, and some analysts said that Palmisano had put in place a structure that would ease the way for anyone to follow in his footsteps. Sources told Reuters in 2010 that Rometty had rebuffed advances from arch-rival HP, which was then looking to replace the ousted Mark Hurd, to stay at the company where she was seen as a rising star. “She has done well at IBM. She has contributed to their expansion overseas — emerging markets — and has done a fantastic job in that space,” said Morningstar analyst Sunit Gogia. “All the public knowledge about her performance is very encouraging.” But “computing is an industry that is always evolving,” Gogia said. “It’s moving into an era of cloud computing.

Commentary: “I wouldn’t say it’s a surprise. I think this is a very good choice. Ginni has been very visible at analyst days and she is one of the most articulate speakers over the last four or five analyst days I’ve attended. “If you think about where the world is going, you can have a technology or a services bend. Ginni is comprehensive about both technology and services, and that is very important. “She has been very hands-on with the corporation and the size it has. I think she has the right strategy to lead the company for the next 10 years. “I would say there’s a huge bench in IBM. Steve Mills is a strong executive but to be CEO of IBM, you can’t be a software guy and he’s a software guy. The software drives IBM hardware. “You need to understand the company’s value chain and I think there couldn’t be a better choice than Virginia. “I wouldn’t say I have met her one on one, but I have interacted with her at analyst says. She is the most impressive executive of all the companies I have followed, and has an aura of magnitude. In tech, you can’t be just a sales person and you can’t just be a services person. You have to have comprehensive experience. “She has the skills and and she’s passionate. I wouldn’t consider her to be an administrator — she is more an entrepreneur. An administrator thinks shorter-term and is focused on politics. Entrepreneurs are focused on both the short-term and the long-term and its success that motivates them, not politics.” “It’s wonderful news for IBM shareholders. She has all the smarts as any other top executive. She has something extra that is rare — she has this spark, enthusiasm, bubbling positive energy that is catchy. “This isn’t the kind of stuff you learn at Harvard or Stanford or any other business school. You are born with it. She has that in a pleasant and unobtrusive way. “Nothing new really. IBM is a well-oiled machine, set a new stock record for an all-time high. She just has to keep up the momentum. She, along with Sam Palmisano, are the reason that IBM is doing so well.” “She has done well at IBM. She has contributed to their expansion overseas — emerging markets — and has done a fantastic job in that space. All the public knowledge about her performance is very encouraging. “Computing is an industry that is always evolving. It’s moving into an era of cloud computing. The company will have to reinvent itself for the future, stay with the times and maintain the revenue base when they do that. “It was expected. Typically their CEOs step down at 60. She was speculated to be a strong contender.” “I don’t know enough about the incoming CEO. But I do know their current CEO has made the right calls in terms of moving them away from hardware and toward software and focusing on global infrastructure. “IBM’s structure is set up so that it’s going to be difficult for a new CEO to come in and make a mess of it, like what happened at Hewlett Packard.” “He may have resigned a little earlier than expected. The surprise will be probably be out of the stock tomorrow once trading gets rolling. “The positives will carry on and there’s always room for improvement.” “It’s largely expected that Palmisano would step down this year, just looking at the prior CEOS who all step down as they turn 60. “In terms of Rometty, she is a logical choice. This is a non-event. “Some view this as a disappointment for other SVPS that were in the running. “I don’t think Steve Mills will leave.

174,IBM,Buffett sheds tech aversion with big IBM investment,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett has always made his distaste for technology investments clear, but on Monday he changed his ways in spectacular fashion. The Berkshire Hathaway chief executive said he has bought nearly $11 billion of International Business Machines Corp stock in the last eight months, building a roughly 5.5 percent stake that potentially makes him the largest shareholder in the company. It was a surprise reversal for Buffett, who has always said he would not invest in technology because he largely did not understand it. But in an interview on cable television network CNBC, Buffett said he was struck by IBM’s ability to retain corporate clients, which made it indispensable in a way that few other services are. “It’s a company that helps IT departments do their job better. It is a big deal for a big company to change auditors, change law firms” or to switch to a new technology vendor, Buffett said. “I don’t know of any large company that really has been as specific on what they intend to do and how they intend to do it as IBM,” said Buffett, who teased CNBC’s anchors for a few minutes with a guessing game about what the major investment was before unveiling the IBM news. IBM shares, which have a market value of about $220 billion, were up 0.2 percent to $187.79 in afternoon trading. Earlier they hit $189.84, nearing the all-time high of $190.53 that the stock touched in mid-October. Buffett, known as one of the best value investors of all time, appeared to have come to IBM late in the game — a year ago the stock was a third lower than it is now. Buffett himself said he should have paid more attention to IBM five years ago. Yet technology analysts said he had still gotten a good deal. “Maybe he could have gotten a better price ... but if you look at Warren Buffett’s investment policy I would assume this is a long term investment,” said Collins Stewart analyst Louis Miscioscia. “This is not your father’s IBM; the management has done a good job of cost control, returning cash to shareholders.” Though it seems like a contrarian move, one long-time Berkshire investor speculated that Buffett was buying IBM for its services business rather than its technology platform. “It’s going to be one of the four or five ‘generals’ in the portfolio,” said Steve Check, chief investment officer of Check Capital Management, a California firm. Another long-standing Berkshire shareholder said the investment was also a global play. “More confirm(ation) that he sees international as more important,” said Michael Yoshikami, chief executive of wealth manager YCMNET Advisers, which manages about $1 billion and holds Berkshire shares. The investment fits with Buffett’s desire to make big bets. Earlier this year, in his annual letter to investors, he joked about having a loaded elephant gun ready to make big deals. He has followed through on that, buying chemicals company Lubrizol, investing $5 billion in Bank of America Corp and taking the IBM position. Though Berkshire started buying IBM shares in March, Buffett’s comments suggested the firm did not cross reporting thresholds on the investment until the third quarter, which let him keep the stake secret until Monday. Buffett has also previously asked for, and received, the right to keep some investments temporarily confidential on the grounds that, given his notoriety, if his trades were to be known, masses of investors might try to pile in as well. The IBM stake was so confidential, in fact, that the company had no idea Buffett was investing in it until he disclosed that he had bought 64 million shares on TV on Monday. An IBM spokesman declined to comment. According to Thomson Reuters data, Buffett’s 5.5 percent position in IBM would tie him with State Street Corpinvestment management affiliate State Street Global Advisors for the largest stake in the company. During the third quarter, IBM shares traded in a range of $157.14 to $185.61, suggesting that no matter when Buffett bought, he is still up on his investment at least $160 million. The median analyst price target for the stock is $200, with 14 of 28 analysts rating it a “strong buy” or “buy” and the rest rating it a “hold,” according to Thomson Reuters data. One thing Buffett is not buying is European banks. Buffett comes up whenever there is talk of a large European bank needing to raise capital, particularly in the current environment of writedowns on sovereign debt. But he told CNBC that he would need to understand European banks better before investing, and that he has not yet seen an investment opportunity there in which he wants to take part. The “Oracle of Omaha” and Berkshire Hathaway chief executive said he expects Europe’s economy to show improvement 10 years from now, but getting there will be difficult. In a three-hour interview, Buffett also disclosed that he was interviewed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in June about David Sokol, his former heir apparent who left Berkshire amid scandal earlier this year. Sokol left the company after it emerged he had bought shares in Lubrizol while trying to convince Buffett to acquire it. Buffett said he had an informal interview with the SEC, which was not a deposition and was not transcribed by a court reporter. He told CNBC the SEC had questions it wanted answered, and he and Berkshire were cooperating. The Sokol episode turned into a major scandal for Berkshire earlier this year, with Buffett conceding at the company’s annual meeting that he had handled the matter poorly.

176,IBM,UPDATE 5-Buffett builds $10.7 bln stake in IBM,"* Says started buying in March * Did not tell IBM he was accumulating stake * Due to report quarterly holdings Monday night By Ben Berkowitz Nov 14 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett said his Berkshire Hathaway Inc has accumulated a 5.5 percent stake in IBM , the billionaire investor’s biggest bet in the technology field he has historically shunned. Buffett said he was convinced by IBM’s long-term roadmap and by its entrenched position with major businesses — part of the durable competitive advantage that he looks for when investing in a company. “I don’t know of any large company that really has been as specific on what they intend to do and how they intend to do it as IBM,” Buffett told CNBC in an interview on Monday. The move puts Buffett’s money squarely in the heart of the technology industry, a sector he has steadfastly avoided on the grounds he simply did not understand it. One long-term Berkshire investor said the investment was a global play. “More confirm(ation) that he sees international as more important,” said Michael Yoshikami, chief executive of wealth manager YCMNET Advisers, which manages about $1 billion and holds Berkshire shares. Buffett said he had bought about 64 million shares of IBM, paying $10.7 billion. Berkshire started buying the shares in March, with a goal of building a $10 billion position, he said. Buffett said IBM did not know that he was building a stake and that the company was finding out about his investment for the first time as he disclosed it on television. An IBM spokesman declined to comment. Buffett said he has always looked at IBM’s annual report — his preferred method of identifying companies to invest in — but this year “I read it through a different lens.” He said follow-on conversations with various technology executives throughout the Berkshire conglomerate convinced him to start building the stake. Berkshire is due to make a quarterly report of its equity holdings Monday night. Though it started buying IBM shares in March, Buffett’s comments suggested Berkshire did not cross reporting thresholds on the investment until the third quarter, which let him keep the stake secret until Monday. According to Thomson Reuters data, a 5.5 percent position in IBM would tie Buffett with State Street Global Advisors for the largest stake in the company. IBM shares rose nearly 1 percent in premarket trading. Buffett, known as one of history’s great value investors, appears to have gotten into IBM late in the game. By early March, when he started buying the stock, the shares had risen more than 25 percent from their low of six months earlier. Even the stock’s lowest point during the third quarter, when Buffett built the rest of his stake, was one of its highest levels ever. At a Friday close of $187.38, the stock is nearing analysts’ median price target of $200, according to Thomson Reuters data. One place where Buffett is not investing is European banks. Buffett, who put $5 billion into Bank of America Corp earlier this year, comes up whenever there is talk of a large European bank needing to raise capital, particularly in the current environment of writedowns on sovereign debt. But he told CNBC that he would need to understand European banks better before investing in them, and that he has not yet seen an investment opportunity there in which he wants to take part.

The euro fell against the dollar as initial optimism about prospects of crisis-fighting reforms under new governments in Italy and Greece gave way to caution over the huge debt problems still plaguing the single currency zone. “Last week the markets chose to treat the glass as half full in interpreting the retirement of the regimes in Greece and Italy as positive, but it did nothing to cure the underlying issues,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. Industrial production in the euro zone fell in September, the most since early 2009, supporting expectations of a sharp contraction of industry and a probable economic recession. Output at factories in the 17-nation bloc fell 2.0 percent for the month. “It is confirming directionally what investors hold as their belief, which is that Europe is either in or moving quickly toward what is likely recession,” Luschini said. Stocks have traded choppily and in tandem with the euro recently in a sign U.S. investors are taking cues from the euro zone’s mushrooming debt crisis as bouts of risk aversion are followed by periods of relative optimism.

Dow Jones industrial average futures up 6 points, while Nasdaq 100 futures up 0.5 points. Voicing the caution felt in the United States, investor Warren Buffett, chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc , told CNBC it was not clear Europe has the ability to do whatever it takes to stop the crisis. He said it was too early to buy European sovereign debt or bank shares. The president of Italy asked former European Commissioner Mario Monti on Sunday to form a government to restore market confidence in an economy whose debt burden is too big for the euro bloc to bail out. “What we have here is a market that still remains skeptical as to whether or not Italy’s regrouping of its politics will be able to enhance the austerity program,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital. “Remember that Italian politics can be quite surprising at times.” In Greece, new Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, a former central banker who oversaw his country’s entry to the euro zone in 2002, will have to win Wednesday’s confidence vote in his cabinet before meeting euro zone finance ministers in Brussels on Thursday.

181,IBM,Black Friday online sales growth lags last year,"* Amazon growth slower than 2010 surge-ChannelAdvisor * Good weather may have limited online shopping-Mercent By Alistair Barr Nov 26 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc , eBay Inc and other e-commerce companies had a strong “Black Friday,” but the industry’s growth rate lagged last year’s surge in online buying on the traditional first day of the holiday shopping season. Online shopping jumped 24.3 percent on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, versus the same period a year earlier, IBM Benchmark, which tracks transactions on websites of 500 retailers, said on Saturday. IBM was expecting growth of about 15 percent. Higher-than-expected online buying was partly driven by increased use of mobile devices, it said. Some of the best-performing retailers also did a good job informing consumers about online promotions ahead of the crucial post-Thanksgiving shopping day, said John Squire, chief strategy officer at IBM Smarter Commerce. Mercent, a company founded in 2005 which helps retailers sell through e-commerce channels including Amazon, eBay and Google Inc’s Internet search engine, reported a 23-percent jump in Black Friday same-store sales by clients. “E-commerce continues to grow on an absolute basis and take additional market share from (traditional) bricks and mortar retailers,” said Eric Best, chief executive of Mercent and a former Amazon executive. Best expects a “huge” Cyber Monday - which this year falls on Nov. 28 - but he warned that this doesn’t mean the whole holiday season will be strong. Cyber Monday is the first work day after Thanksgiving, when workers often use office computers to shop online. Last year, over $1 billion was spent on Cyber Monday, making it the heaviest online shopping day in history, according to ComScore . “Holiday shopping is becoming more front-loaded around Black Friday and Cyber Monday,” Mercent’s Best said. “All of this is great news, but it’s still early in this 45-day shopping season.” Last year, Mercent clients saw same-store sales growth of 30 percent on Black Friday. Best said slower growth this year may have been caused by better weather. “The weather was really good this year, which can have an effect on the amount of screen time,” Best added. “People were outside shopping offline or they weren’t shopping at all.” Amazon saw some of the strongest growth again this year, according to ChannelAdvisor, which helps merchants sell on websites run by Amazon, eBay and other e-commerce companies. ChannelAdvisor clients saw same-store sales via Amazon jump 49.8 percent on Black Friday, versus a year earlier. Traditional retailers offered Black Friday deals earlier this year, but Amazon aggressively matched this strategy by running Black Friday promotions online starting on Nov. 21, according to Scot Wingo, chief executive of ChannelAdvisor. Still, on Black Friday in 2010, ChannelAdvisor clients saw same-store sales growth of about 80 percent via Amazon, Wingo noted. Sellers on eBay generated same-store sales growth of 15.1 percent on Black Friday this year, down from 15.5 percent year-over-year growth in 2010, he added. Mobile shopping surged on Black Friday but remained a relatively small part of overall online commerce. EBay said U.S. shoppers bought almost two and a half times as many items via mobile devices this past Black Friday compared to 2010. PayPal, eBay’s online payments business, saw a six-fold increase in global mobile transaction volume on Black Friday, versus the same day last year. More than 14 percent of Black Friday traffic on retail websites came from mobile devices, up from 5.6 percent a year ago, according to IBM. eBay said it offered an XBOX 360 250GB Kinect gaming system from Microsoft for $259.99 the evening before Black Friday that sold out in 20 minutes - at a rate of 75 units per minute. Best sellers on Amazon.com on Black Friday included the company’s Kindle Fire tablet computer, a Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-TX10 Waterproof Digital Camera and a Mr. Coffee Single Serve coffee machine powered by Keurig, according to an Amazon spokeswoman.

182,IBM,Early Cyber Monday sales up 20 percent- IBM,"Nov 28 (Reuters) - “Cyber Monday” online retail sales got off to a strong start, International Business Machines Corp’s IBM Benchmark unit said. Online sales as of midday Eastern time in the United States were up 20 percent versus the same period last year, according to IBM Benchmark. Cyber Monday is traditionally the first day after Thanksgiving when employees return to offices — and purchase items using their work computers. In 2010, Cyber Monday sales topped $1 billion, making it the heaviest day of online spending ever, according to comScore Inc . This year, the firm expects Cyber Monday sales to exceed last year’s tally. “We expect most shopping to come from laptops and PCs during the day with mobile shopping activity picking up later,” IBM Benchmark said in a statement. Online sales have grown strongly in the first part of the crucial holiday shopping season, which starts around Thanksgiving and runs through Christmas. ChannelAdvisor, a software company that helps retailers sell more online, said clients saw same-store sales via Amazon.com Inc jump 59 percent on Sunday, versus the same period last year. ChannelAdvisor’s Amazon gross merchandise value hit a record on Saturday, setting the stage for what is likely to be its highest-ever Cyber Monday today, the company added.",11282011,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-retail-cybermonday/early-cyber-monday-sales-up-20-percent-ibm-idUSN1E7AR16L20111128

192,IBM,IBM planning major job cuts in Germany: union,"(Reuters) - International Business Machines is sounding out plans to cut thousands of jobs in Germany and other countries to reduce costs and raise earnings, a German union official said. “We have been aware of IBM’s plans to cut jobs for some time,” Christine Muhr, a labor representative on IBM Germany’s supervisory board, told Reuters on Wednesday. Scope and time frame were still unclear, she said, adding that IBM was planning to reduce the number of full-time employees and hire more temporary staff through projects advertised on the Internet. German business daily Handelsblatt reported in its Wednesday edition that IBM was planning to cut up to 8,000 jobs in Germany. It cited an IBM executive as saying that “in the end it could be that only 12,000 of currently 20,000 jobs will be left in the subsidiary.” Representatives at IBM headquarters in Armonk, New York, were not immediately available for comment. A spokeswoman for IBM Germnay would only comment on the Handelsblatt report, saying the company did not comment on speculation. The paper cited IBM Germany as saying that IBM did not discuss company staffing plans in public due to the competitive nature of its business. According to German services union Verdi, no layoffs have been announced, but Muhr said that IBM was already testing using temporary staff on projects in other countries. Internally the restructuring has been dubbed “Generation Open” and staff that work for IBM on projects but are not full time are called “liquid players,” according to an internal document seen by Reuters. With the move, IBM aims to accelerate the speed at which it completes projects by 30 percent and reduce costs by a third, according to the document. IBM offers a wide range of services, from analyzing data and helping cities manage traffic flow to mining social media data so retailers can tell which products will sell best. IBM wants to deliver earnings of $20 per share by 2015. This year it aims to reach at least $14.85 despite ongoing macro-economic concerns in Europe and expected currency headwinds. Its earnings in 2011 were $13.44 per share. ",2012012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ibm-germany/ibm-planning-major-job-cuts-in-germany-union-idUSTRE8102CW20120201

195,IBM,UPDATE 1-SAP aims to become major database software maker,"* Move will heat up rivalry with Oracle Corp * May also put SAP at odds with IBM, Microsoft * To disclose plans at April 10 press conference March 15 (Reuters) - German software maker SAP AG  says it intends to become a major provider of database software in a move that would heat up its long-running rivalry with Oracle Corp, led by Silicon Valley billionaire Larry Ellison. SAP said it will disclose its plans at an April 10 news conference in downtown San Francisco, not far from Oracle’s headquarters in Redwood City, California. The German company is the world’s biggest maker of business management software, which includes programs that manage tasks such as accounting, manufacturing and payroll. While Oracle is the No. 2 player in that market, it sells more software, thanks to its leadership in the multi billion-dollar market for databases. “SAP will unveil its unified data management portfolio and demonstrate how we will become a leading database vendor,” the company said in a press advisory. SAP acquired Sybase, the world’s No. 4 maker of database software, in July 2010. Former chief executive John Chen has stayed on as CEO of SAP’s Sybase business unit, but has kept a low profile since the acquisition. Chen is not scheduled to speak at the April 10 event, according to SAP spokesman Scott Behles. Since the acquisition, SAP has focused on expanding Sybase’s line of mobility software. It has so far said little about its plans for integrating Sybase’s database technology with its other products. In getting more aggressive in the database business, SAP will be taking on two of its closest sales partners - IBM Corp  and Microsoft Corp. Officials with IBM and Microsoft declined to comment on how SAP’s moves might affect their relationships with the German company, which was founded in 1972 by five ex-IBM employees. Last year, the company launched a specialized database dubbed Hana that pulled in 160 million euros ($208 million) in sales in its first two quarters on the market, ahead of SAP’s target of 100 million euros. So far SAP has sold the technology to handle a series of niche applications, helping companies analyze large quantities of data. But the company plans to make it available as a database for business management applications by the end of the year. SAP will also discuss its mobility strategy at the news conference, Behles said. Oracle spokeswoman Deborah Hellinger declined comment on the matter. SAP and Oracle are in a bitter legal dispute over allegations a unit of SAP illegally downloaded millions of Oracle files. A second trial is scheduled to begin in June after a judge threw out a jury decision that SAP should pay Oracle $1.3 billion.",3152012,http://www.reuters.com/article/sap-oracle/update-1-sap-aims-to-become-major-database-software-maker-idUSL2E8EFBU520120315
196,IBM,IBM ramps up data analytics offerings,"March 20 (Reuters) - International Business Machines  launched on Tuesday three services to help companies sift and understand so-called “big data,” hoping to get some of the $120 billion or more that businesses are expected to invest in data analytics by 2015. IBM, which has spent $16 billion itself on acquisitions to grow its analytics business since 2005, said it aimed to target top executive levels with its new offers of software and services to reduce fraud, manage financial performance and predict customer behavior. It sees strong growth opportunities as companies, governments and organizations struggle to make sense of the large amount of data available. IBM offers the broadest portfolio in the data analytics market and competes with Teradata, SAP, EMC , NetApp and Oracle among others. The idea behind big data is to converge structured data found inside databases and unstructured data found in social networks, mobile devices, meters or sensors to identify patterns or predict behavior. The market for such services is growing at an annual rate of 60 percent, IBM said, and according to IDC research, companies will invest more than $120 billion by 2015 on analytics, hardware, software, and services. IBM, which has a long history of analyzing data, began growing the segment almost a decade ago when the costs of computing started to drop. It now anticipates $16 billion in business analytics revenue in 2015. “It’s not just that we discovered more data could be good, it’s become more economical,” said Steve Mills, who heads IBM’s software and systems unit. Mills, who has a degree in psychology, joined IBM in 1973 at a time when IBM was picking students from all areas for its data processing aptitude test or DPAT. “There was really no computer science at that time ... all you had to do is show up in a suit, not say anything stupid and pass the DPAT,” Mills said. Today, IBM’s analytics can be found across various industries, from water and waste management to traffic and retail predictions. Its new services could be used to protect against insurance fraud, for example, IBM said. Infinity Insurance, which specializes in covering high-risk drivers, was applying IBM analytics to detect patterns in historic data to identify fraudulent claims more quickly, IBM said. In the healthcare sector, where Mills said fraud runs up to $650 million in costs per day, IBM systems use advanced algorithms to help spot fraud before claims are paid.",3202012,http://www.reuters.com/article/ibm-data/ibm-ramps-up-data-analytics-offerings-idUSL1E8EKJ6G20120320

199,IBM,Facebook buys 750 patents from IBM-source,"SAN FRANCISCO, March 22 (Reuters) - Facebook has acquired hundreds of patents from International Business Machines Corp as the social networking company attempts to bolster its intellectual property portfolio in the wake of a lawsuit filed by Yahoo. The 750 patents from IBM cover a broad range of technology, ranging from search to semiconductors, according to a person familiar with the matter. A Facebook spokeswoman said the company had no comment, and an IBM representative could not immediately be reached. Yahoo sued Facebook earlier this month, claiming that Facebook infringed 10 patents, including several that cover online advertising technology. A classic defense for companies targeted with patent claims is to threaten a countersuit using its own patents. But Yahoo possesses far more patents than Facebook. Before the IBM transaction, Yahoo had over 3,300 patents and published patent applications, according to a U.S. government database. Facebook had 56 issued patents and 503 applications as of December 31, the company said in a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Facebook, the world’s largest Internet social networking service, is preparing for an initial public offering that could value the company at up to $100 billion. It is unclear how much Facebook paid for the IBM patents, but tech companies seeking to build their portfolios have pushed intellectual property prices higher. Google agreed to buy Motorola Mobility last summer for $12.5 billion, and said Motorola’s patents were a prime attraction. That deal came after Nortel Networks Corp < NRTLQ.PK > sold about 6,000 patents to an Apple Inc-led consortium for $4.5 billion, after Google bowed out of the bidding. IBM’s transaction with Facebook was first reported by Bloomberg.",3222012,http://www.reuters.com/article/facebook-ibm-patents/facebook-buys-750-patents-from-ibm-source-idUSL1E8EM89Y20120322
200,IBM,Pressure builds for Augusta golf club to bend ban on women,"* President Obama, challenger Romney join the call * Women can play the course only if invited by member AUGUSTA, Ga, April 6 (Reuters) - Political pressure mounted on Friday for Augusta National Golf Club, which hosts the Masters tournament, to bend its ban on women members to allow the female chief executive of tournament sponsor IBM to join the exclusive club. President Barack Obama and his likely Republican challenger in the race for the White House, Mitt Romney, both said on Thursday the conservative, all-male club should admit women. On Friday, former presidential candidate and Arizona Senator John McCain joined the chorus, posting on Twitter: “Don’t you think it’s time Augusta National joined the 21st century - or the 20th - and allowed women members?” The controversy concerns Virginia Rometty, the 54-year-old former IBM global sales chief tapped in October to head IBM, which is a leading sponsor of the glamorous tournament. Traditionally, the CEO of a major corporate sponsor is granted club membership and given one of Augusta’s famous green jackets, which go to the winner of one of the world’s most celebrated sporting events. Four previous male IBM chief executives have been granted membership to Augusta. At a pre-tournament press conference on Wednesday, Augusta Chairman Billy Payne repeatedly refused to comment on whether Rometty would be offered membership. “We don’t talk about our private deliberations,” Payne said in response to a question. “We especially don’t talk about it when a named candidate is a part of the question.” The club has stubbornly adhered to the all-male membership rule, even when it came under intense scrutiny over the issue a decade ago. In 2002, a heated war of words erupted between Augusta’s then-chairman William “Hootie” Johnson and Martha Burk, the former chair of the National Council of Women’s Organizations. She attacked the club’s males-only policy as sexist. At the time, 15 percent of the club’s membership were CEOs, many of them from Fortune 500 companies. Burk argued the exclusion meant women were at a disadvantage at social events where business relationships are often formed. Johnson said Augusta was just a single-sex organization, like the Boy Scouts or the Girl Scouts. The controversy led two high-profile members of Augusta to resign from the club. John Snow, former President George W. Bush’s nominee for Treasury Secretary, resigned before he was confirmed in that post. Thomas Wyman, a former CBS television network CEO left the club, calling its policy “pigheaded.” IBM has tried to steer clear of the controversy. “We don’t comment on our executives’ travel schedules,” IBM spokesman Edward Barbini said on Friday in response to a question on whether Rometty would attend the event, which concludes on Sunday. Augusta’s invitation-only membership has been steeped in secrecy since the conservative club opened in 1932. Women are allowed to play the course if invited by a member but cannot become members themselves. The club does not reveal its full list of members, believed to be around 300, although it is known that some of the most powerful men in industry and finance are members, including Microsoft founder Bill Gates and investor Warren Buffett.",4072012,http://www.reuters.com/article/golf-masters-ibm/pressure-builds-for-augusta-golf-club-to-bend-ban-on-women-idUSL2E8F63VR20120407
201,IBM,IBM targets rivals with info tech maintenance product,"(Reuters) - IBM is taking aim at competitors such as Hewlett Packard Co and Oracle Corp with PureSystems, a new product line that helps companies reduce time and money spent on increasingly complex information technology maintenance. Data from both IBM and research firm IDC shows that companies spend upwards of 70 percent of their IT budgets on simple operations and maintenance, leaving little to invest in innovation. Perhaps more alarmingly, two-thirds of corporate IT projects exceed the allotted budget and are delivered behind schedule. “PureSystems will help clients to free up time and money to focus on innovation and the urgent to-do’s that many businesses cannot address due to ever rising costs and staffing needs in the traditional data center,” IBM said in a statement. For example, the company said that the time and effort needed to build, procure and deploy the infrastructure needed for a typical Web application currently takes six months or more. But PureSystems, which includes a number of different offerings and will be available this quarter, could reduce that time by a third. “Depending on how large the system and application is, it could take days and weeks to set up, with PureSystems it could take less than a day in some cases,” said Ron Adkins, head of IBM’s systems and technology group. PureSystems was developed through acquisitions and $2 billion in research and development over four years. Jon Rymer, an analyst at research firm Forrester, said that the launch of PureSystems was “hugely important” to IBM because many of the areas in which the company competes have become commoditized. “Their added value is in creating higher-performing products,” Rymer said, noting that IBM was taking the infrastructure convergence trend further than its competitors. Oracle, HP, Cisco Systems Inc and other top IT vendors have been pushing converged infrastructure, which integrates server, storage, networking and other technologies into a single managed architecture. Ideally, this locks customers in while keeping competitors out. “IBM is taking that further by layering Websphere and data centers on it,” said Rymer, referring to IBM’s Websphere, which is a set of tools that allow customers to create and manage business Websites. As an impetus for adoption, IBM said it would buy back servers, including those made by HP and Oracle, from those clients migrating to PureSystems. But Rymer said he was not sure if IBM’s offer to dispose of customers’ existing equipment would take off. “We’ll see if anybody cares,” Rymer said.

204,IBM,IBM may raise full-year software demand forecast,"(Reuters) - IBM Corp (IBM.N) reports earnings after the bell on Tuesday and investors are hoping strong software demand will make for a repeat of last year’s first-quarter performance, when the company raised its full year forecast. After Oracle Corp’s ORCL.O strong first-quarter software sales and outsourcing firm Accenture Plc’s (ACN.N) positive outlook on IT spending, there is a chance that IBM - which competes with both companies - may raise its full year outlook. Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu wrote in a recent note that there was a “fair likelihood” IBM would “modestly raise” its outlook. Software represents IBM’s most important division and biggest growth driver and includes everything from data analytics that help forecast and fight crime to software that manages infrastructure. IBM, which dumped its PC business in 2004 to concentrate on consulting and services, has squarely focused on software as a means to provide the foundation for its growth strategy. The company proved that once again on Monday, with the Nikkei business daily reporting it sold its point-of-sale (POS) terminal business, which includes cash registers and related devices, to Toshiba Corp (6502.T) for 70 billion yen ($870.86 million). IBM declined to comment. IBM’s software business generated 44 percent of its pre-tax profit last year and the company has said it will contribute 50 percent to its segment profit by 2015. IBM has said it expects to reach an operating EPS of at least $14.85 this year compared with analysts’ forecasts of $14.94, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In the first quarter, analysts expect IBM to post an operating EPS of $2.65 and sales of $24.8 billion. The thinking behind IBM’s strategy is that specialized software is of higher value and will result in higher margins, keeping IBM firmly on track to reach its earnings per share goal of $20 by 2015. Sterne Agee’s Wu agrees, saying IBM’s strategy of marrying IT with software and services “has given it strategic and structural advantages.” Improving demand for branded middleware - a software that facilitates integration of applications or end devices and servers - and continued momentum in analytics could make software the stand-out division this quarter and this year for IBM, according to Goldman Sachs. IBM competes with business software makers Oracle Corp and SAP AG (SAPG.DE) as well as Hewlett Packard Co (HPQ.N). IBM’s services business, its second-largest unit, is expected to be stable given rival Accenture’s strong quarter and optimistic outlook. That is good news for investors considering that outsourcing competitors Infosys Ltd (INFY.NS) and Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp (CTSH.O) had warned that customers were spending less. The services unit incorporates PriceWaterhouseCoopers consulting business, which IBM bought in 2002. It generated 42 percent of the company’s pre-tax profit in 2011. IBM’s smallest division, its mainframe business, is expected to continue to show declining revenue in the first half of 2012. But rising demand for storage should boost the business near-term, Goldman Sachs said. “We believe a new mainframe cycle and remarkably easy comparisons could produce healthy revenue and profit growth in the second half,” Goldman Sachs said. Stifel Nicolaus’ David Grossman said IBM may even be taking server business away from HP and Oracle. “In hardware, HP and Oracle posted weak January and February quarters, respectively, which we believe at least partially reflects competitive displacements by IBM,” Grossman said, adding that IBM would likely benefit from an ongoing infrastructure build-out in emerging markets. IBM trades at 13.2 times estimated 12 month forward earnings, according to StarMine, which gives more weight to timelier forecasts and those from the historically most accurate analysts. By comparison, Oracle and HP are valued at 10.9 and 5.8, respectively. As it has done historically, IBM’s Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge will run the company’s earnings call and not new Chief Executive Virginia Rometty, who made headlines last week for attending the Masters golf tournament, hosted by the Augusta National Golf Club - a men’s only club. IBM is one of the sponsors of the tournament and its CEOs have traditionally been granted membership to the exclusive club, but so far Augusta chairman Billy Payne has refused to say whether it would change its policy for Rometty.

Toshiba Tec Corp, which will make the purchase, is ranked fourth worldwide and has a 7 percent share, the newspaper said. IBM technology will strengthen Toshiba’s cloud computing services that enable stores, shoppers, manufacturers and others to exchange information and offer services, the Japanese daily said. Toshiba Tec aims to close the deal, financed mostly by cash reserves and bank loans, by the summer, the daily said.

206,IBM,IBM boosts outlook; revenue shortfall hits shares,"(Reuters) - IBM’s revenue fell slightly short of Wall Street expectations, sending its shares down almost 2 percent in late trade even as the company beat quarterly profit expectations and boosted its 2012 earnings target on strong software demand. International Business Machines, whose shares had closed up 2 percent on Tuesday, reported revenue of $24.7 billion — flat with the previous year and below analyst expectations for $24.78 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company, which has been shifting its focus from hardware to higher-margin services and software over the past decade, raised its full year target to at least $15 adjusted earnings per share on strong demand for its software services and growth in emerging markets. Analysts had on average anticipated $14.94. IBM’s previous target was for at least $14.85. Despite the share reaction, some investors were heartened by the strong guidance for the full year and IBM’s profit growth. “I think the stock was priced for perfection,” said ISI Group analyst Brian Marshall. “Revenue was a little light relative to expectations. They did a good job on the bottom line. The guidance was good.” IBM’s Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge promised IBM would deliver revenue growth again in the second half of the year once it overcomes some obstacles in the second quarter such as currency headwinds and two challenging projects in Japan. “I think stabilizing Japan in the second half and seeing the new announcement contribution from our hardware base of business, that’s going to be a significant dynamic,” Loughridge said on a call with analysts, adding that the challenges in Japan were “a bit of an anomaly”. ISI’s Marshall said IBM was careful to pursue revenue that would also lead to margin growth. “What they’re doing is maximizing their operating margins by making sure they’re not taking on revenue opportunities that aren’t going to give them high margins,” Marshall said. Loughridge said the software business — IBM’s largest segment — had a strong quarter with revenue of $5.6 billion, up 5 percent and that its smallest unit, the systems and technology business, declined as expected, falling 7 percent. In services, IBM said its IT consultancy unit GBS declined 2 percent mainly due to problems in Japan and little demand in the public sector, while demand for its infrastructure services grew 2 percent. Asked about his expectations for Europe, Loughridge said it looked “pretty stable”, noting that growth in the United Kingdom and Spain was particularly strong. Rival outsourcing company Accenture cheered investors last month by beating expectations on strong growth in Europe, especially after competitors such as Infosys and Cognizant had warned of lower IT spending due to the Eurozone debt crisis. IBM also competes with business software makers Oracle Corp and SAP AG as well as computing giant Hewlett Packard. IBM said earnings per share, excluding items, in the first three months of the year were $2.78 — beating average analysts’ earnings per share of $2.65. Net earnings rose 7 percent to $3.1 billion. The company’s shares fell 2 percent to $203.50 in late trade after closing up 2 percent at $207.45 on New York Stock Exchange.

208,IBM,"Instant View: Intel, IBM, Yahoo in earnings trifecta","(Reuters) - Intel forecast better than expected revenue and said the first Intel-chip-based smartphones will emerge this quarter, marking its response to a consumer shift toward tablets and other mobile gadgets. IBM, which also reported after the closing bell, posted first-quarter profit above Wall Street’s targets and the blue chip is closely watched as an indicator of enterprise IT spending. Completing a trio of major earnings released on Tuesday, Yahoo Inc, which is going through a massive internal overhaul, posted better than expected earnings. Intel: “It looks like a solid result and a good guide. “I would have liked to see a stronger enterprise computing number. We maybe got a little ahead of ourselves with expectations. The fundamentals are strong in cloud. “The quarter was a beat, and I don’t think that the tablet threat is growing. You could argue it’s getting less significant. The tablet seems to be going more and more into e-readers, 7-inch screens”, which are less of a threat to larger PCs. “I’m still expecting a strong second half of the year.” “Expectations were a little high and the stock had a good run going into earnings. The results and guidance are in line but there were slightly higher expectations. “Mobile is still small and probably not material at this point. Their bread and butter continues to be PCs. We think demand has mostly come from restocking in the channel and supply chain, rather than market demand. We may get more color on the call about that. Advanced Micro Devices, or “AMD is actually growing faster than Intel. They have been taking share on the notebook side.” “Revenues came in better than expected. The margin guidance for Q2 looks a little light, and that’s probably why the stock is down. “Given the topline is slightly better than expected, it doesn’t seem like there’s a meaningful impact from tablets right now. The PC market is holding up pretty well.” “IBM has been on a great tear here. I think the stock was priced for perfection. There’s a little bit of profit taking here. “Revenue was a little light relative to expectations. They did a good job on the bottom line. The guidance was good. “At the end of the day the numbers looked fine to me. “What they’re doing is maximizing their operating margins by making sure they’re not taking on revenue opportunities that aren’t going to give them high margins. At the end of the day there’s a lot of pruning going on here. “The important part is they continue to expand earnings. EPS looked pretty good. “The black eye is systems and technology. Their hardware business was down 7 percent year over year. The area that continues to shine is software. That was up 6 percent year over year.” Yahoo: “Very modestly ahead of expectations, disappointing display results (down 4 percent), that is obviously their most important business. “Yahoo continues to struggle in the Internet advertising space. “Investors are anxious to hear how (CEO Scott) Thompson can turn this around and are largely skeptical he can do it. It’s going to be hard for him to articulate a convincing strategy but investors are all ears now.” “Here is the one piece that is always sad about Yahoo. Their income from operations was about $169 million and their earning and equity interest was about $172 million. “Their minority stake in their investments is generating more profit than their core business. “So far Scott has done the right things. He is bringing in some of his own people, he’s taking costs out of the system. His first quarter out of the gate, he controls what he can control, which is earnings.” ",4172012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-earnings/instant-view-intel-ibm-yahoo-in-earnings-trifecta-idUSBRE83G1JB20120417

Chesapeake Energy Corp dropped 5.5 percent to $18.06 and was among the most actively traded stocks on the New York Stock Exchange after a Reuters report that CEO Aubrey K. McClendon did not disclose loans of as much as $1.1 billion over the last three years against his stake in thousands of the company’s oil and natural gas wells. The stock fell as low as $17.17, its lowest since July 2009. International Business Machines Corp and Intel Corp ranked among the biggest drags on the Dow. IBM missed its revenue forecast, while investors said Intel’s results failed to make a “bull case” for the stock. IBM shares slipped 3.5 percent to $200.13 while Intel shares fell 1.8 percent to $27.95. The PHLX semiconductor index dropped 0.9 percent. The lackluster reports from the two technology heavyweights came at the start of what has so far been a strong earnings season. On Tuesday, the S&P; 500 had its best day in a month as Coca-Cola Co led the day’s round of solid earnings and concerns eased over the euro zone’s debt crisis. Tuesday’s rally also gave both the Dow and the Nasdaq their biggest one-day percentage gains since March 13. “Both Intel and IBM have led to some profit-taking today, with both companies posting decent reports, but disappointing investors for different reasons,” said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at RDM Financial in Westport, Connecticut. “If you want to be an optimist, you could point to the fact that the market didn’t sell off all that much, given the solid advance we saw yesterday.” The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 82.79 points, or 0.63 percent, to close at 13,032.75. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index shed 5.64 points, or 0.41 percent, to 1,385.14. The Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 11.37 points, or 0.37 percent, to 3,031.45. After the closing bell, shares of Qualcomm fell 3.3 percent to $64.77 as the chipmaker provided a disappointing quarterly and full-year outlook. In contrast, shares of eBay shot up 7.6 percent to $38.60 in extended-hours trading following the release of its results, which topped expectations. Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist of Robert W. Baird & Co in Nashville, Tennessee, expects the market to continue its back-and-forth moves, possibly trending lower in the second quarter after strong gains earlier in the year. “A consolidation or correction phase in the second quarter would make the most sense, and probably it would be the most healthy thing for the market,” he said. In the regular session, among other declining stocks were Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s Class B shares, which dropped 1.3 percent to $79.74 a day after CEO Warren Buffett said he has cancer. On Tuesday, Buffett said that he has Stage 1 prostate cancer that “is not remotely life-threatening or even debilitating in any meaningful way.” A bright spot in the tech space, Yahoo Inc shares gained 3.2 percent to $15.49, a day after reporting that quarterly revenues rose - marking Yahoo’s first quarterly sales growth in three years, as the new CEO outlined plans to revamp the struggling Internet media company.

The companies did not disclose financial details for the deal, which is expected to close in the second quarter of this year. An IBM spokesman said the company hopes to address company marketing officers with Tealeaf’s software and as a result open up new revenue streams. Tealeaf, which was founded in 1999 and is an independent spin-off of SAP, offers software that improves websites and will be integrated into IBM’s software business, IBM said on Wednesday.

Buffett’s revelation in November that he bought IBM stock surprised many investors, given his usual aversion to technology stocks. Even in Berkshire’s annual report, which lists criteria for acquisitions, Buffett said he prefers “simple businesses (if there’s lots of technology, we won’t understand it).” Buffett controls most of Berkshire’s investment portfolio.

226,IBM,IBM sets record low coupon for 7-year note,"NEW YORK, May 8 (IFR) - International Business Machines Corp on Tuesday set a record for the lowest ever coupon on a seven-year note, breaking through the 2.00% barrier in that maturity for the first time. IBM, rated Aa3/A+/A+, sold $1.5 billion of debt in a two-part deal, consisting of $900 million of three-year notes and $600 million of seven-year notes. The seven-year priced at 99.85 with a coupon of 1.875%, to yield 1.898% or 65 basis points above comparable Treasuries. The three-year priced at 99.834 with a coupon of 0.75% to yield 0.806% or 45 basis points above Treasuries. IBM already holds the low coupon record in three-years with its 0.55s due February 2015, a tough number to beat. Tuesday’s three-year managed to rank number 4 - tied with WalMart, Coca-Cola and Pepsico in that position. Today’s three-year marks the fourth appearance by IBM in the current top 20 three-year bucket. Announced as benchmark size, initial price talk was for a deal in the high 40-70 basis point area. Official guidance emerged right in line with that talk, coming in at Treasuries plus 45-47 basis points on the three-year and 70 basis points area on the seven-year. IFR does not include a seven-year bucket in its regular low coupon top 20 runs as it is a rare maturity. But the IBM deal tops the previous record low of 2.25% held by John Deere from a trade done on April 12 and Private Export Funding Co (PEFCO) on a deal carried out in 2010.

227,IBM,IBM's 'building whisperer' sees retrofit boom,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - America’s skyscrapers, many built before World War Two, are showing their age. IBM’s “building whisperer,” Dave Bartlett, believes many of these buildings could use a diet. Bartlett, who leads IBM’s smarter building initiative, is known as the “building whisperer” because he views buildings as living organisms, an approach that can help identify problems and suggest cost-effective ways of making buildings healthier and more energy-efficient. Bartlett is bullish about demand for building retrofits, a market that electrical service companies and other participants see growing by double-digits for several years. “In New York City, we’re definitely in the depths of middle age, trying to get a second lease on life,” Bartlett said. “I’m very gung-ho about the outlook for retrofits.” Getting a building in shape is a lot like eating right. Under this approach, dubbed “the physiology of buildings,” a heating and cooling system is akin to the respiratory system; elevators and corridors are a circulatory system; and a building’s smart sensors with sophisticated computer monitoring are the nervous system. Each system affects others: water meters in bathrooms work together with security systems to analyze occupancy, affecting how quickly the building breathes in fresh air. Lighting, by heating a space, affects how much power is used for cooling. With the right data, an owner can decide whether replacing air conditioners makes better sense than a new roof. The interaction of those systems adds up to an ecosystem that can be measured and improved, like a visit to the doctor or a gym membership. Bartlett, who studied biology, eventually sees buildings forming part of a wider ecosystem that brings nature into cities, making them more literally “green.” IBM is in the early stages of greening New York’s massive convention hall, the Jacob Javits Center, looking at ways to turn its sprawling roof into an animal habitat. “We think we can create one of the largest green spaces in Manhattan,” Bartlett said. FAST-GROWING MARKET Technology giant IBM competes in a market for building automation software that is forecast to reach $36 billion by 2015. The global market for energy efficiency in buildings will reach $103.5 billion by 2017, up more than 50 percent from 2011, according to Pike Research, a consultancy. The high-profile retrofit of the Empire State Building is becoming a rallying point for advocates who say building retrofits could lift the U.S. economy and create jobs. “The savings are so significant,” Bartlett said. “It’s a building everyone knows and everyone appreciates.” Engineers Johnson Controls Inc and its partners on the Empire State retrofit said Monday energy savings are ahead of projections. Not all retrofits require a lot of capital, according to IBM. Some call for only minor modifications to control systems or the way people operate the building. Recent upgrades to lighting, security and other systems have led to a proliferation of sensors. The next step is tap the vast data being generated to look for patterns and potential savings, and to improve the quality of life for tenants. For example, heating and a cooling system may both be optimized, but if they are not communicating, they could be working at cross-purposes. Obstacles remain to a retrofit boom. One of the biggest is a lack of financing for capital-intensive projects. Also, the motivation is split between building owners who commit money and tenants who benefit from lower utility costs, Bartlett said. However, the cost of leased assets like buildings is increasingly the concern of finance chiefs, especially under accounting rules that make such assets more visible on the balance sheet. Those CFOs will push for smarter use of space, while more tenants are also demanding green work spaces. “We’re at this tipping point,” Bartlett said. “It’s going to take off.” ",5082012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ibm-buildings/ibms-building-whisperer-sees-retrofit-boom-idUSBRE8470US20120508
228,IBM,IBM helps oil companies manage gusher of data,"HOUSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM thinks it can make geologists and engineers more effective at mining the fast-growing wealth of data on everything from oil reservoirs to refineries to help them find, extract and process oil. The computer services company has spent the past three years building a team of 5,000 consultants, scattered around major oil basins worldwide, to help companies tackle the data explosion. Just having a lot of data is not enough: As with crude, data must be refined and then shipped out to the people who can use it: those who make drilling decisions with millions of dollars on the line. “Data management: we see a lot of effort, and by effort I mean investment, in that space,” David Womack, IBM’s director of strategy and business development for chemicals, petroleum and industrial products, told the Reuters Global Energy & Environment Summit on Tuesday. “They’ll give you these big data sets, and being able to manage and manipulate that is a non-trivial act,” he added. Chevron Corp has estimated its network manages 1.5 terabytes a day, or equivalent to about 1.5 million books, and says its computers store more information than the Library of Congress. Much of that is due to the development in recent years of three-dimensional oil reservoir imaging, which is far more data-intensive than 2-D seismic imaging. Even on the other end of the oil value chain, refiners deploy thousands of small instruments to monitor various parts of their plants. “They’re about valves and transmitters, and if it creates a pile of data for somebody? They don’t think about that,” IBM’s Womack said. He said Royal Dutch Shell Plc hired his team to help manage the data deluge. An equivalent expansion of processing power has been driven by “cluster computing,” with multiple computers tied together to solve one huge problem. “As you get faster machines, you can beat out analytics that tell you you’ve got to change injection rates in this area or that area,” Womack said. “You can hit enter and get an answer back in 10 hours, instead of 10 weeks.” Womack stressed that sophisticated imaging will be crucial in locating new reservoirs now that all the “easy oil” is gone. Three years after Chevron introduced the industry’s first 3-D visualization centers in 1997, the California oil company started working with cluster computers, which are now its standard set up. It retired its last mainframe computer in 2010. In a 2010 interview, Chevron Chief Technology Officer John McDonald explained how real time reservoir management allowed the company to start up a Gulf of Mexico project three months early. “That data has great utility if you can start making sense of it,” McDonald said at the time.

232,IBM,IBM helps oil companies manage gusher of data,"HOUSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM thinks it can make geologists and engineers more effective at mining the fast-growing wealth of data on everything from oil reservoirs to refineries to help them find, extract and process oil. The computer services company has spent the past three years building a team of 5,000 consultants, scattered around major oil basins worldwide, to help companies tackle the data explosion. Just having a lot of data is not enough: As with crude, data must be refined and then shipped out to the people who can use it: those who make drilling decisions with millions of dollars on the line. “Data management: we see a lot of effort, and by effort I mean investment, in that space,” David Womack, IBM’s director of strategy and business development for chemicals, petroleum and industrial products, told the Reuters Global Energy & Environment Summit on Tuesday. “They’ll give you these big data sets, and being able to manage and manipulate that is a non-trivial act,” he added. Chevron Corp has estimated its network manages 1.5 terabytes a day, or equivalent to about 1.5 million books, and says its computers store more information than the Library of Congress. Much of that is due to the development in recent years of three-dimensional oil reservoir imaging, which is far more data-intensive than 2-D seismic imaging. Even on the other end of the oil value chain, refiners deploy thousands of small instruments to monitor various parts of their plants. “They’re about valves and transmitters, and if it creates a pile of data for somebody? They don’t think about that,” IBM’s Womack said. He said Royal Dutch Shell Plc hired his team to help manage the data deluge.

233,IBM,IBM tries to tidy yield curve with exchange offer,"NEW YORK, May 29 (IFR) - IBM has launched what bankers hope will be the liability management trend of the year: exchanging old, high coupon bonds that are marring corporate yield curves for new highly liquid securities. The company is asking bondholders to tender about $322 million of 7.125% 100-year bonds due 2096, $187 million of 8% notes due 2038, and $800 million of the outstanding $1.54 billion of 5.6% notes due 2039 — all in exchange for a new 30-year bond with a 4% coupon. At first glance, it’s hard to understand why investors would agree to give up IBM bonds that are paying the kind of coupons offered these days by junk-rated companies. But with a record number of investment-grade bonds now trading well above par — and suffering extreme illiquidity as a result — investors may be more willing to surrender their coveted high-coupon investments. According to Barclays, about 92% of all of the bonds in the Barclays US Corporate Investment Grade Index are trading above par, and more than 48% trade at more than $110. The average price of the index stands at $111.30. A full 541 bonds, or 14.24% of the market value of the index, trades above $125. Some, like the 8% 2038s that IBM is tendering for, trade as high as $165. The company’s 5.6% 2039s trade around $127-$128 and the 7.125% 2096s trade around $150-$156. The bonds have soared in price precisely because they offer such high coupons. Union Electric’s 8.45% 2039s, for instance, trade around $162; MetLife 10.75% 2039s at $138 and Altria’s 10.2% 2039s around $158. While portfolio managers love the coupons, liquidity has become a high priority. When an issuer such as IBM is willing to pay a premium over the market value of the bond and offer a liquid on-the-run security, investors can be enticed to loosen their hold on high-coupon debt. “Exchange offers have more appeal to investors now than they did even a year ago, because secondary-market liquidity has deteriorated and investors have limited appetite for very high dollar price bonds,” said Pamela Au, head of liability management at Barclays. “These bonds have underperformed due to their lower duration, and every dollar above par translates into additional recovery risk for investors.” High dollar price bonds naturally become more illiquid because, in case of default, a bondholder can only claim up to the par amount. “Every dollar a bond trades above par is a dollar you will not get back in a default scenario,” said Perry Piazza, director of investment strategies at Contango Capital Advisors in San Francisco. High coupon and high dollar price bonds have much less convexity than par bonds, which means that the rate of change in their price as yields change is lower than in a par bond. That reduces their appeal to investors who trade actively in the bond market. Some insurance companies are also restricted from buying very high dollar priced bonds. For many companies, high dollar bonds is a problem they would love to have. But for a blue-chip issuer like IBM, which has consistently re-written the record book in the past year for low coupons, its stable of high coupon longer-dated bonds is an eyesore — and one with real pricing consequences for a new deal. “We often make the case to issuers that a high dollar, high coupon bond can distort their credit curve,” said one head of liability management at a major Wall Street firm. “If we are going to bring a new bond to market for an issuer, the most obvious place for an investor to look for a pricing comparable is that issuer’s existing bonds in the same part of the curve.” Exchanges make sense for companies that can extract a net present value positive scenario, after taking the upfront tax benefits from paying off old debt — and amortizing the cost of doing so over the life of the new bond. IBM will be relying heavily on the offer of a liquid benchmark new 30-year to entice bondholders to tender, especially those holding the 100-year bonds maturing 2096. IBM has made its offer for the 2039s the most attractive of the three, according to one source. It has capped the exchange on this note to $800m of principal. The 2039s were created in 2009, as part of a tender and exchange for the 2038s and 2096s at the time. The company is paying less for the 2038s than it did in 2009, and nothing in the way of a premium on the 2096s. Even so, bankers away from the deal thought IBM was generally offering a fair trade. “We think what IBM is offering is very reasonable,” said one banker. “We would expect pretty good participation, although you might see smaller participation for the 38s and the 96s because they’re tendering for the residuals left from a previous exchange, and these might be the tougher ones to get.” One banker thought IBM was offering about a 20bp pickup on average for the 39s and 38s, and nothing for the 96s. In the week of the exchange announcement, the 2039s were quoted at around $127-$129 to yield around 3.84% at the higher price. IBM was offering an extra $40 for every $1000 denominated bond, if the bonds are tendered by an early exchange date of June 4. That equates to a $1,155.07 principal amount of new notes for every old bond tendered. Bond holders also get $150 in cash per old bond. The 2038s were around $165 to yield around 3.82%. IBM is offering an early exchange premium of $40 principal amount of new notes, but no cash. That equates to $1,694.8 principal amount of new notes for every old bond. IBM is not offering anything in the way of a premium on the 2096s, however. Each old bond will be exchanged for $1,369.69 of new notes, plus $200 cash. Those bonds were trading around $150-$156 when the exchange was announced, to yield around 4.6%. “The tender for the 2096s is really about the liquidity they are being offered in the new bond,” said one banker not involved in the deal. “The 2096s were trading at US$125 in 2009 and now they are trading at US$156.” Exchanges rarely get full participation, and one that takes out at least half to 75% of the eligible bonds is considered a success.

236,IBM,Seoul shares fall as Spain bank aid hope turns to worry,"* KOSPI retreats from Monday’s 4-week closing high * Shipbuilders pull back after hefty previous gains * Unison up after Toshiba becomes majority stakeholder By Joonhee Yu June 12 (Reuters) - Seoul shares fell on Tuesday morning to retreat from a four-week high set in the previous session, as earlier optimism over the bailout plan of Spain’s cash-strapped banks was dashed by worries of mounting public debt pressure in that country. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) was down 0.96 percent at 1,848.94 points as of 0203 GMT. “We may see a moderate 1 percent decline with foreigners not selling too heavily so far, although the market was disappointed that the bailout came with conditional strings attached after all, with the possible side effect of hampering Spain’s ability to refinance itself in the capital market,” said Park Suk-hyun, an analyst at KTB Securities. “The price of the bailout will become clearer on whether or not the funds are tapped from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), but the decision likely won’t come before the independent audit results on Spain’s banks due in a week’s time,” he added. Although it remains unclear whether or not the bailout will utilize the ESM, whose debt has senior credit status over that of private bondholders, its possible use sparked a selling binge by ordinary investors on the added risks of a bigger haircut to cover for the ESM loans in case of a financial restructuring deal. Notable corrections were seen among shipbuilders after they outperformed peers on Monday, with Hyundai Heavy Industries  falling 2 percent Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering shed 1.8 percent. Investors were seen taking refuge in some defensive plays, as foodmaker Dongwon Industries rose 1.6 percent while brewer Hite Jinro Holdings edged 0.2 percent higher. Shares in energy firm Unison bucked trends to gain 3.2 percent after reporting to the Korea Exchange that Japan’s Toshiba Corp had increased its stake in the company to 31.3 percent to become the majority shareholder. The KOSPI 200 benchmark of core stocks was down 1 percent while the junior, tech-heavy KOSDAQ edged 0.3 percent higher. Foreign investors sold a net 20.8 billion won ($17.8 million) worth of shares for the morning, on track to end three straight net buying days.

238,IBM,SAS says spurned IBM and others for independence,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - SAS Institute, the world’s largest privately held software company, said it plans to remain independent despite continued approaches from companies such as IBM keen to acquire the only pure play data analytics firm, its top executive said. “Before IBM went on their buying spree they came to us first because they recognized the fact that our solutions were something no one else has, everyone else is just a tool maker,” Chief Executive Jim Goodnight said in an interview on Wednesday. “I wasn’t willing to sell because I have seen what happens to companies that get swallowed by a bigger company, all their culture disappears, a lot of employees disappear,” Goodnight, who co-founded the company in 1976, explained, adding that SAS was courted at regular intervals by interested parties. IBM, which has been beefing up its data analytics offerings with a number of acquisitions, declined to comment. Goodnight said IBM approached SAS shortly before IBM acquired Cognos in 2007 but a price was never discussed. “It never got to that point mainly because I did not want them looking at our books,” he said. SAS itself has pursued a moderate acquisition strategy, on average buying two companies a year, said Jim Davis, SAS’ senior vice president and chief marketing officer. Typically we acquire companies that move us into domains where we don’t have much expertise,” Davis said. SAS started out doing agricultural research and has grown into the world’s largest company that helps customers collect and analyze data generally known under the term “big data.” The idea behind big data is to converge structured data found inside databases and unstructured data found in social networks, mobile devices, meters or sensors to identify patterns or predict behavior. Goodnight, a tall, soft-spoken Wilmington, North Carolina native who holds a doctorate in statistics from the state’s university, said the company routinely surveys staff on a number of issues among which is the question of whether employees would like SAS to become a publicly listed company. “85 percent said no right after the dot.com bust and that has consistently stayed the same,” he said. Revenue last year was $2.75 billion and according to research firm IDC, SAS had a leading data analytics market share of 35 percent in 2010, the most recent figure available. Davis said the company had seen revenue growth and profitability every year since it was founded and that its sales were growing partly thanks to its rivals. “When we talk about IBM and SAP or Oracle getting in this space, yes they have very large marketing budgets they can outspend us in a week but... their interest in this space has increased sales for us by creating awareness,” Davis said. He added SAS generates about 40 percent of its revenues from the financial sector but also has a large presence in the government sector, retail sector as well as telecommunications, manufacturing and life sciences. Goodnight said that despite the economic turmoil in Europe the company was seeing demand especially from governments keen to increase their tax revenue for example. “There is a lot of interest right now in the revenue departments of various countries to improve their tax revenue and they use SAS to detect the filers who have underfiled or not filed at all,” Goodnight said. Davis added that “there’s a whole different side to government too which is the top secret side, the security perspective for example where analytics plays a big role”. SAS software will also be used to help the city of London monitor criminal activity through social media during the Olympics, Goodnight said. “The silver lining in this gray economic cloud that we have had in the past few years is that analytics has sort of risen in stature... it’s no longer a back office function it is now considered an asset,” Davis said. Asked if there were any succession plans, Goodnight, who turns 70 next year, declined to say but quipped: “They have plans to stuff me.” ",6202012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sas-independence/sas-says-spurned-ibm-and-others-for-independence-idUSBRE85J1K820120620
239,IBM,Fitch affirms IBM's IDRs at 'A+/fF1'; outlook stable,"June 20 (Reuters) - NEW YORK, June 20 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) and IBM International Group Capital LLC (IIGC), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary whose debt is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by IBM, as follows: IBM —Long-term IDR at ‘A+’; —Senior unsecured revolving credit facility at ‘A+’; —Senior unsecured debt at ‘A+’; —Short-term IDR at ‘F1’; —Commercial paper (CP) rating at ‘F1’. IIGC —Long-term IDR at ‘A+’; —Senior unsecured debt at ‘A+’; —Short-term IDR at ‘F1’; —CP rating at ‘F1’. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch’s action affects approximately $42 billion of debt, including IBM’s undrawn $10 billion credit facility. The ratings and Outlook reflect IBM’s: —Strong company profile primarily supported by i) significant revenue market share in information technology (IT) services (#1), servers (#1), enterprise software (#1) and external storage (#2); ii) Solid recurring revenue (50%) from IT services, software and financing that mitigates revenue and profit volatility; and iii) Highly diversified revenue base by offering, customer, industry and geography (60%+ revenue outside U.S.). —Exceptional financial flexibility due to i) robust internal liquidity with a significant cash position ($12 billion) and free cash flow (FCF) exceeding $11 billion since 2008; ii) solid external liquidity with an undrawn $10 billion RCF due 2016 and ready access to capital markets; iii) strong credit protection metrics; and iv) Roughly $26 billion of finance receivables (59% short-term and 62% considered investment grade). —Well executed management strategy, including i) ability to identify early trends that present significant higher margin, long-term growth opportunities and reposition investment priorities, both organic and inorganic, to capitalize on these opportunities (i.e. analytics and growth markets); ii) consistent and sizable investments in R&D; (6% of revenue) to develop innovative differentiated solutions that leverage IBM’s entire portfolio of offerings and command higher profit margins (i.e. Smarter Planet); iii) core competency in identifying and integrating strategic acquisitions and iv) established track record of consistently meeting or exceeding financial forecasts. Ratings concerns include: —Risk of core debt (non-financing) increases to achieve financial and/or business objectives, such as sizable debt-financed share repurchases and/or acquisitions, resulting in a material reduction of credit protection measures. Fitch notes IBM has significant incremental debt capacity without adversely affecting its current credit ratings. —Consistent, material increases in cash dividends long-term, which could pressure FCF and financial flexibility in the absence of commensurate growth in profitability. This could necessitate further increases in core debt to fund acquisitions and/or share repurchases. —Long-term outlook for mainframe demand (system z) and associated operating system software (zOS) as industry standard servers become increasingly capable. This could potentially narrow the cost (i.e. total cost of ownership) and benefit differential to mainframes. IBM has strong financial flexibility and liquidity supported by $12.3 billion of cash and equivalents as of March 31, 2012 and an undrawn $10 billion revolving credit facility expiring on Nov. 10, 2016. Liquidity is further supported by strong and consistent annual FCF (post-dividends) exceeding $11 billion since 2008. Fitch expects IBM’s FCF to be approximately $13 billion in 2012. This is primarily due to continued profit margin expansion, reflecting a more favorable revenue mix and continued cost discipline. Also a factor is modest top-line growth led by Smarter Planet solutions, business analytics, growth markets and cloud computing. Fitch expects IBM to continue to use FCF for acquisitions, particularly in the software and services industries, aggressive share repurchases and dividend payments to shareholders. The underfunded status of IBM’s worldwide defined benefit (DB) pension plans deteriorated to negative $10.4 billion (89% funded) at year-end 2011 from negative $7.9 billion (92% funded) in 2010. This is primarily due to lower discount rates in the U.S. and worldwide plans, which increased the present value of IBM’s future pension liability (US discount rate declined 80 basis points to 4.2%). Excluding unfunded nonqualified DB pension plans, the funded status of IBM’s U.S. and worldwide plans at year-end 2011 and 2010 was 96% and 99%, respectively. In 2012, IBM is legally mandated to contribute a minimum of $800 million to its international DB plans. This compares with approximately $800 million actually contributed in 2011. The amount of the 2012 pension contribution is very manageable given the amount and consistency of IBM’s cash flow. Fitch believes IBM has more than ample liquidity to satisfy its longer-term legally mandated pension funding requirements (estimated at approximately $3.9 billion through 2016). This estimate could increase due to more frequent re-measurement of funded status in certain non-U.S. countries and the performance of financial markets. Total debt was $32.1 billion as of March 31, 2012 and consisted of $6.3 billion of short-term debt (including $300 million of CP) and $25.8 billion of long-term debt. Fitch estimates $23.6 billion (74%) of total debt is attributable to IBM’s global financing business with the remaining debt attributable to core (non-financing) operations. For the purpose of financial evaluation, Fitch analyzes IBM’s core business and financing activities separately since they are capitalized differently and have dissimilar cash flow characteristics. IBM Global Finance (IGF) accounted for nearly 9% of IBM’s pre-tax earnings in 2011. This, however, represents the largest component of IBM’s balance sheet, constituting approximately 28% of total assets and 25% of total liabilities as of March 31, 2012. IBM has $2.9 billion of long-term debt maturing in the remainder of 2012 and nearly $5.5 billion in 2013. Fitch believes IBM will refinance the vast majority of the upcoming debt maturities in order to maintain a targeted debt/equity ratio of approximately 7x for the financing business and maintain a permanent amount of core debt in the capital structure. Total leverage and interest coverage as of March 31, 2012 were relatively unchanged at 1.2x and 27.8x, respectively. Core leverage and interest coverage remained flat at 0.3x and 62.2x, respectively. The main purpose of IGF is to facilitate clients’ acquisition of IBM systems, software and services by providing financial and capital management solutions. IGF has a solid long-term operating record, provides strategic advantages to IBM in terms of attracting and retaining customers by delivering total solutions. IBM also generates an annuity-like revenue stream associated with multi-year leases. IGF’s primary focus on IBM’s products and clients mitigates some risks associated with financing via a deep knowledge of its client base and clear insight into the solutions being financed. Asset quality metrics have remained relatively solid due to a relatively conservative underwriting culture and strong risk management capabilities. IGF’s capitalization remains solid for the rating category and leverage levels continue to hover near management’s target of 7x.",6202012,http://www.reuters.com/article/ibm-fitch/fitch-affirms-ibms-idrs-at-a-ff1-outlook-stable-idUSWNA961420120620

241,IBM,Analysis: Tech Inc's invincible aura fades,"(Reuters) - Hopes are evaporating that leading technology companies will offer a safe harbor this year from the economic storms swirling across Europe, Asia and the United States. Investors should brace for some of the biggest names in U.S. software and hardware — from Microsoft Corp and IBM to Intel Corp — to disappoint when Big Tech begins reporting quarterly earnings next week, analysts said. The trio’s shares are all in the red for July, in the wake of earnings warnings over the past week from smaller peers, including Advanced Micro Devices Inc, Applied Materials Inc and Informatica Corp. Corporate IT budgets have historically proved more resilient to worsening macroeconomic conditions than other kinds of spending, because businesses invest on the assumption that technology boosts productivity and helps save them costs over the long term. But investors may have misjudged the depth of the European crisis, and with once-reliable-as-clockwork Chinese growth waning, demand in other emerging markets has not picked up enough of the slack. The profit warnings could signal a broader pullback in orders, which means that Wall Street’s earnings projections now appear over-optimistic to some outside experts. “I don’t think the companies or the market anticipated the kind of slowdown like the one we are going to see in the second half,” said Fred Hickey, editor of the High-Tech Strategist Newsletter for investors. “Companies haven’t had a chance to adjust estimates yet and they will. That’s coming,” said Hickey, who has been following the tech industry since the 1980s. The sense of impending gloom is not confined to the United States. Samsung Electronics, Asia’s top-earning tech company and the world’s leading maker of smartphones, TVs and memory chips, has predicted record quarterly profit of $5.9 billion for April-June — but its stock has slumped more than a fifth since May on concerns about the broader outlook for chip demand and the impact of the euro zone crisis on sales of its TVs and home appliances. Since mid-June, analysts have cut by more than a quarter their earnings forecasts for LG Electronics, South Korea’s other tech heavyweight, according to Thomson Reuters Starmine SmartEstimates, which accords higher weight to the timeliest forecasts from historically more accurate analysts. Shares of China’s Lenovo, the world’s No.2 PC maker behind Hewlett Packard, have retreated to 5-month lows with brokers downgrading their outlooks for the company as global economic weakness damps demand for personal computers. In Japan, a fast fading powerhouse in consumer electronics and technological innovation, shares in Sony Corp and Panasonic Corp are mired near more than three-decade lows as investors fret over their ability to regain profitability in today’s hostile macro environment and against tough competition from nimbler rivals in South Korea and Taiwan. The one bright spot is Apple Inc, which still has many fans on Wall Street. The iPhone and iPad maker is one of the few major tech stocks to have gained in July, up 4 percent. Apple has beaten analysts’ earnings forecasts in seven of the past eight quarters by at least 12 percent. Last quarter, it reported earnings 22.5 percent above Wall Street estimates. Its performance has propped up the entire sector and analysts expect a new iPhone this year to keep that up. Apple is likely to report earnings of more than 1 percent above the Street’s average forecast, according to StarMine SmartEstimates. In contrast, Microsoft, which is preparing to launch the Windows 8 operating system and its first tablet computers, may report earnings 0.7 percent below the average. “Guidance could turn out to be very conservative given momentum with new Macs, a potential iPad mini and ongoing success with the new iPad,” Barclays analyst Ben Reitzes said in a research note. Apple said the latest iPad will hit Chinese store shelves on July 20. Apple aside, market watchers expect the economic malaise will broadly hit technology companies in the second half of the year, even at firms that managed to squeak by in the second quarter and avoid issuing preliminary earnings warnings. Over the past three months, analysts have largely held on to their second-quarter earnings forecasts for technology and telecommunications companies, while cutting estimates in other sectors. Now many may have to make up for that oversight. An IDC survey of chief information officers (CIOs) at about 250 U.S. companies conducted two weeks ago found, on average, that they expected their budgets to decrease for the first time since early 2009. “There is this sense among CIOs that things have slowed down and they are going to have to think about ways of cutting back,” said IDC analyst Stephen Minton. Analysts currently forecast companies in the S&P; 500 Index will report profit growth of 5.8 percent in the second quarter, with technology earnings growing at 7.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. They are more optimistic about prospects for the second half and that’s where some expect cuts to come. Analysts forecast third-quarter earnings growth of 12.9 percent for the S&P; 500’s technology index and fourth-quarter growth of 14.9 percent. Companies at risk in the second half include services giant IBM, No. 1 chipmaker Intel, as well as software makers including Microsoft and VMware Inc, analysts said. It’s not a surprise to some that sentiment has shifted so quickly. Historically when businesses have frozen or cut technology budgets, they have sometimes done so suddenly, taking tech companies and Wall Street by surprise. That process appears to have begun. “Sentiment is turning into reality,” said Cliff Waldman, senior economist with the Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity and Innovation. “Negative sentiment is truly starting to affect investment spending.” When it issued its warning last week, Informatica said business conditions “dramatically” worsened in June with customers scrutinizing deals more closely.. Applied Materials warned on Tuesday that it expected weak demand from chipmakers to put a damper on sales through at least the third quarter. “Demand is weaker than expected in Europe and China, and this makes chipmakers delay or cancel equipment orders,” said James Song, analyst at KDB Daewoo Securities in Seoul. “They are slowing investment in capacity expansion or technology migration.” Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, which manages about $54 billion, blames the tech turmoil on Europe, a strengthening U.S. dollar, which reduces the revenue contribution from overseas sales, and concerns about a U.S. tax increase. “If there is no improvement on domestic data points, or news from Europe that the saga has ended, why should there be a change?” Luschini said.

242,IBM,IBM raises earnings outlook despite weak tech spending,"NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) raised its full-year earnings target, even as it posted a quarterly revenue shortfall, reflecting its ability to manage costs as global technology spending sputters. International Business Machines Corp, a bellwether for the global IT industry because of its global span and breadth of businesses, now expects full-year earnings per share - excluding items - of at least $15.10, versus at least $15.00 previously. The company known as Big Blue has shifted its focus from hardware to higher-margin services and software over the past decade. But like rivals Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) and Oracle Corp ORCL.O, it continues to grapple with sliding budgets as the European crisis tightens spending and emerging market growth decelerates. IBM said on Wednesday its revenue fell 3 percent to $25.8 billion in the quarter, missing average expectations of $26.27 billion. It said it took a $1 billion hit because of a weaker euro and other foreign exchange “headwinds” that translate into fewer dollars. Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge told analysts on a conference call after IBM reported earnings that they foresaw a $2 billion hit from foreign currency factors in the second half. Richard Sichel, chief investment officer for Philadelphia Trust Co, said it was encouraging to see IBM raising its profit forecast after a string of recent earnings disappointments by other technology firms. But he said investors also wanted to see sales rise. “You want to see earnings grow by top-line growth and not by cutbacks and buybacks and that sort of thing,” he said. IBM said second-quarter earnings per share, excluding items, was $3.51, beating average analysts’ estimate of $3.43. A number of companies such as Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) have cautioned that tech spending may slow down in the second half of 2012 and companies such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.N have warned that earnings would suffer. (For a graphic: U.S. tech companies since July 2 link.reuters.com/rew39s) IBM shares rose 2.5 percent to $193 in extended trade, from their New York Stock Exchange close of $188.25. The stock has fallen 11 percent in the three months since it reported a quarterly revenue shortfall when it last released earnings.

243,IBM,"Instant View: IBM hikes 2012 outlook, Qualcomm misses; eBay keeps forecast","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - International Business Machines, a bellwether for the global enterprise IT sector, raised its outlook for fiscal 2012 earnings, defying worries about how crumbling corporate tech-spending may erode the bottom line. Qualcomm Inc, also reporting on Wednesday, missed quarterly revenue and earnings targets and pulled back on estimates for mobile device shipments in 2012. And EBay Inc rounded out major technology-sector earnings with better-than-expected quarterly results. It stuck to its full-year forecasts, seemingly averting a major hit from Europe’s woes. Commentary: “IBM’s miss on the top line is related to the macro conditions. It suggests that revenue will be a challenge for all technology companies. Most technology companies close their big deals in the last weeks of the quarter. Only the first month of this quarter was okay. The last two months were terrible. “This weakness is a buying opportunity for stocks like IBM, HP, Apple, Google and VMware. They are getting impacted by macro-economic conditions. But there is no market-share loss. You should buy stocks like this when times are bad and use them as a buffer.” “They did better on margins, expenses and share buybacks. So they delivered EPS upside. We continue to think that that is going to be challenging to continue to deliver upon, in the face of revenue deterioration. “They’re big, so there’s limited opportunities. Two, currency headwinds were much greater than what they forecasted. And three, 60 percent of their revenue come from aboard.” “I know they missed on the top line, but a lot of that is currency. I don’t think a lot of the people who forecast are all that great about figuring out the currency equation. “The headline here is really margins. I expected them to be more in-line with last year. For example, Global Technology Services was 36.3 percent and last year it was 34 percent. It’s really hard to manage a bench of people and get money out of them. Another example was Global Business Services. That came in at 30.7 and last year it was 28.9. “The only area where I am kind of concerned is hardware, because I see the margins declining.” RICHARD SICHEL, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, PHILADELPHIA TRUST “It’s very nice that they beat expectations on earnings. I would say the look-ahead is really what investors are looking for. You get a very credible forecast this way, and what they said was more positive than how people have been feeling lately.” “They modestly missed on the revenue line, partially due to forex, and slightly on software hardware revenue. “But the big message is they beat EPS handily and they’re raising the full-year EPS target, and that’s probably enough for the stock to keep working. It’s a sign that this company can keep executing despite the revenue headwinds they have.” Qualcomm: “The slight miss and slight guide-down for the September quarter was generally about as expected. The company reassured on the other hand that the ramp in 28-nanometer chips is happening and they expect a strong December quarter. “They said that since June 24, they have repurchased about $617 million worth of stock. The other positive thing is the ASPs of devices shipped in the March quarter, on which they recognized royalties in the June quarter, were much higher than what people and the company had estimated. That’s good news in the long run as well.” “It’s a mess, well below expectations on revenue guidance, and chip sales much lower than people expected. It could be a slowdown in demand, it could be a delay in the iPhone 5. It could be 28 nm supply.” EBay: “The numbers suggest strength in the Marketplaces business in the quarter. So I think some of the initiatives in the last couple of years have definitely helped. The biggest change is really fixed price. “International was fairly strong, they actually saw an acceleration in the international GMV for Marketplaces. The quarter was pretty solid across both Marketplaces and payments and they maintained guidance over the year. “This quarter will help reinforce what management has been trying to say for a while now, that the turnaround in Marketplaces is sustainable. PayPal had “impressive growth. The total revenue number was a little bit light of what we were expecting. But they did also mention that they’re now expecting Ebay and Paypal mobile to each do $10 billion in volume in 2012. So there were some positive comments in terms of PayPal opportunity. I’m sure not that the flightiness on the payments number will detract from the long term opportunity there. “Guidance was a bit little bit below the Street’s. I think people had anticipated that there could have been some weakness there, particularly with the Euro depreciation which really began in earnest in May. As we look forward now, I think guidance has remained conservative. Consensus is at the high end of the range. So I think most of those factors are already embedded within current guidance.” (Reporting by Malathi Nayak, Alexei Oreskovic and Noel Randewich in San Francisco and Jim Finkle in Boston)",7182012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-ibm/instant-view-ibm-hikes-2012-outlook-qualcomm-misses-ebay-keeps-forecast-idUSBRE86H1GT20120718
244,IBM,Technology earnings boost Wall Street,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks rose on Thursday for a third straight day, with the S&P; 500 at a 2-1/2 month high, as earnings from technology companies and expectations for more monetary stimulus outweighed weak economic data. So far in this earnings season a majority of companies have beaten analysts’ lowered expectations. In the latest boost, IBM (IBM.N) raised its full-year outlook, eBay’s (EBAY.O) profit beat forecasts and Qualcomm (QCOM.O) said it expects a “strong December quarter.” “Europe has been quiet and earnings news, while not earth-shattering, is slightly better than expected,” said Fred Dickson, chief market strategist at D.A. Davidson & Co. in Lake Oswego, Oregon. “A trading range environment is how we see it.” Weak manufacturing and employment data as well as falling revenue at investment bank Morgan Stanley (MS.N), which sent its shares down more than 5 percent, capped gains in the wider market. The S&P; financial index .GSPF fell 1 percent. Even so, expectations that the Federal Reserve will soon step up stimulus efforts have helped the market shake off bad news. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said this week that the U.S. central bank would act if the outlook worsened. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI gained 34.66 points, or 0.27 percent, to 12,943.36. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX rose 3.73 points, or 0.27 percent, to 1,376.51. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC added 23.30 points, or 0.79 percent, to 2,965.90. But despite the Nasdaq’s out-performance compared with the other indexes, decliners in the index beat advancers by a ratio of more than 5 to 4. Investors like to see advancers beating decliners by a wide margin to confirm market strength. The S&P; is at its highest level since early May. Some investors are pointing to a trading range between recent highs above 1,400 and a low in June around 1,280. “People are focusing on individual stocks after earnings and trying to figure out (through) outlooks how weak the economy really is,” said Giri Cherukuri, head trader at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois. “It is baked into stock prices that growth is going to be slow for a little while,” he said. Manufacturing in the U.S. mid-Atlantic region shrank for a third month and home resales were lower than forecast. That came shortly after a report showed more Americans applied for unemployment insurance in the latest week. IBM shares jumped 3.8 percent to $195.34, making it the largest boost to the Dow industrials a day after it raised its full-year profit forecast. Semiconductor company Qualcomm cut its revenue and earnings forecast for the current quarter, but investors took heart as it said sales would improve for a strong last quarter of 2012, sending its shares up 4.2 percent to $58.43. EBay shares jumped 8.6 percent to $43.95 after it posted stronger-than-expected quarterly revenue and earnings as more consumers shopped on its online marketplaces and used its PayPal payment service. Morgan Stanley fell 5.3 percent to $13.25 as quarterly revenue declined due to a slowdown in trading and dealmaking volumes. The company will cut 1,000 employees by the end of this year. Of the 19 percent of S&P; 500 companies reporting earnings so far, 65 percent have beaten expectations, slightly better than average since 1994, according to Thomson Reuters data. U.S.-traded shares of Mellanox Technologies MLNX.TA(MLNX.O) touched their life-time high after the chipmaker’s profit beat analysts’ expectations. Mellanox, up about 41.5 percent at $93.90, was the biggest boost to the PHLX semiconductor index .SOX. Outside the tech sector, Textron (TXT.N) shares rallied 11.5 percent to $26.50 after the world’s largest maker of corporate jets, which also makes EZ-Go golf carts and industrial components, handily beat Wall Street forecasts. Walgreen WAG.N shares soared 11.7 percent to $34.62 and Express Scripts Holding (ESRX.O) added 1.9 percent to $58.76 after the companies said they struck a pharmacy network agreement that settles a long-running dispute. Walgreen competitor CVS Caremark (CVS.N) fell 6.2 percent to $45.43. Shares of Johnson Controls (JCI.N), the battery and auto interiors company, tumbled 7.9 percent to $26.07 after it posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit and cut its outlook for the current period. About 6.5 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and Amex, compared with the 50-day moving average of 6.7 billion shares.

245,IBM,US STOCKS-Futures point to gains driven by earnings,"* IBM rallies after raising outlook, Morgan Stanley down * S&P; on track to notch third straight day of gains * Jobless claims rise more than expected in latest week * Futures up: Dow 43 pts, S&P; 7.2 pts, Nasdaq 16.5 pts By Ryan Vlastelica NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures looked poised on Thursday to extend its recent rally, even as a weak reading on the labor market underlined the headwinds facing the economy’s recovery. The S&P; 500 index was on track for a third day of gains, after Wednesday’s advance took it to its highest level since May. The rally has largely been driven by corporate earnings, and investors were cheered by IBM ‘s move to raise its full-year profit forecast late on Wednesday. Futures were off session highs early on Thursday as jobless claims rose more than expected in the latest week, the latest in a string of data pointing to weakness. “The labor market is clearly not recovering,” said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York. “We don’t expect employment to recover strongly anytime soon.” Still, futures remained in positive territory after IBM’s rosier full-year forecast, which bucked a recent trend of tech companies - such as Intel Corp and Qualcomm Inc  - lowering their outlooks. Analysts feared the reduced views could have negative broader implications as the sector is considered a proxy for business spending. Shares of Dow component IBM rose 2.5 percent to $193 in premarket trading. S&P; 500 futures rose 7.2 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures added 43 points and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 16.5 points. The S&P; is on track to notch a third straight day of gains on Thursday, having advanced 1.4 percent over the past two sessions. Investors have been concerned that the debt crisis in Europe and signs of slowing growth worldwide would hurt corporate profits, but thus far, most companies have beaten the recently moderated expectations of analysts. With 10 percent of the S&P; 500 having reported, according to the latest Thomson Reuters data, 73 percent have exceeded expectations. “What IBM did, and what other companies are indicating, is that earnings will not be as poor as people felt was possible,” said Rick Meckler, who helps oversee $2 billion as president of LibertyView Capital Management in New York. “When you see earnings hold up in a weakening economy, that allows stocks to keep their momentum and suggests these companies could really advance when the economy picks up.” Morgan Stanley fell 3.6 percent to $13.49 before the bell as quarterly revenue declined due to a slowdown in trading and dealmaking volumes. A pair of Dow components also reported. Travelers Cos Inc  posted a profit that missed expectations while Verizon Communications Inc’s revenue rose on strong subscriber additions, though the revenue was slightly below consensus estimates and shares fell 1.5 percent to $45.21. Existing home sales and the Philadelphia Fed business activity survey are on tap for release at 10:00 a.m. (1400 GMT) Home sales are seen rising 1.1 percent, while the Philadelphia Fed survey’s main index is expected to improve to minus 8.0 for July from minus 16.6 the month before. Weak economic data recently has amplified hopes the Federal Reserve would step in with measures to boost growth. On Wednesday, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke repeated in congressional testimony the Fed’s pledge to act if the economy needed it. Later in the day, the Fed’s anecdotal Beige Book survey showed the economy is still struggling. Nokia Corp  also reported results, coming in with a loss that was narrower than expected and ending the quarter with more cash than investors had expected.

247,IBM,IBM raises earnings outlook despite weak tech spending,"NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) raised its full-year earnings target, even as it posted a quarterly revenue shortfall, reflecting its ability to manage costs as global technology spending sputters. International Business Machines Corp, a bellwether for the IT industry because of its global span and breadth of businesses, now expects full-year earnings per share - excluding items - of at least $15.10, versus at least $15.00 previously. Unlike other companies, IBM said it had seen a strong June and Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said he was “pretty confident going into the next quarter.” Smaller companies such as Informatica INFA.O said earlier this month conditions “dramatically” worsened in June with customers scrutinizing deals more closely and possibly signaling a broader pullback in tech spending [ID:nL3E8I62XC] [ID:nL2E8IB0GR]. Despite Loughridge’s confidence, IBM — like rivals Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) and Oracle Corp ORCL.O — continues to grapple with declining corporate budgets as the European crisis tightens spending and emerging market growth decelerates. The company known as Big Blue has been compensating by shifting its focus from hardware to higher-margin services and software over the past decade but software revenue was flat in the quarter and services was down 2 percent. IBM said on Wednesday its revenue fell 3 percent to $25.8 billion in the quarter, missing average expectations of $26.27 billion. It said it took a $1 billion hit because of a weaker euro and other foreign exchange headwinds that translate into fewer dollars. IBM generates about 60 percent of its revenue outside the U.S. While revenue in the Americas declined by only 1 percent, the drop in Europe, Middle East and Africa was 9 percent. The Asia-Pacific region grew a mere 2 percent. Loughridge told analysts on a conference call after IBM reported earnings that the company foresaw a $2 billion hit from foreign currency factors in the second half. Other companies that have a similar global reach will grapple with currency effects as well, said Andrew Bartels, analyst at research firm Forrester. Some analysts expressed confidence that IBM would continue to manage any impact on revenue. “I am not concerned about revenue growth,” said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein & Co, citing “IBM’s ability to deliver against its EPS objectives, especially given the significant cost reductions the company is taking this year.” Others said that while they appreciated the raised earnings targets, revenue growth would be appreciated as well. Richard Sichel, chief investment officer for Philadelphia Trust Co, said it was encouraging to see IBM raising its profit forecast after a string of recent earnings disappointments by other technology firms. But he said investors also wanted to see sales rise. “You want to see earnings grow by top-line growth and not by cutbacks and buybacks and that sort of thing,” he said.

248,IBM,IBM prices first ever 10-year bond with a coupon below 2%,"July 25 (IFR) - IBM Corp on Wednesday priced the first 10-year coupon inside of 2.00% - grabbing the all-time low-coupon record for that maturity with an impressively low 1.875%. Big Blue has become a virtual master at breaking low coupons over the last two years, with eight out of 12 tranches priced during the period resetting the bar for low-coupon issuance. 3M Co had set a tough level to beat in 10-years when it priced its 2-part deal comprising five-year and 10-year debt on June 21 with a couple of landmark tranches of its own.  The 10-year came in at 2.00%, and the five-year at 1.00%. IBM was clearly a contender to beat that level but the company’s quarterly earnings came and went last Wednesday with no appearance.  Instead, IBM made its move today, and was able to knock 3M Co from the top of the 10-year table. A look back at IBM’s trades over the past couple of years shows that today’s deal is one of many low coupon records the company has managed to wipe out during that period. IBM’s last visit to the market was on May 8 with a USD1.5bn 2-part offering of three-year and seven-year notes. In that transaction, IBM printed the lowest seven-year coupon on record  - the 1.875s due May 2019. The three-year tranche in the May 8 deal priced with a coupon of 0.75%, which was above the 0.55% the company achieved on notes due February 2015. That record three-year was part of a USD2.5bn two-part offering of three-year and five-year notes that priced on February 1. Both parts of that deal set records — the five-year priced with a coupon of 1.25%, although the record was short-lived. Walt Disney swept in on February 9 with notes due February 2017 that achieved a coupon of 1.125%. That record, in turn, was taken out by 3M Co on June 21 with a five-year tranche that had a coupon of 1.00%. Back on Aug 2, 2010, IBM achieved the first-ever three-year deal to print with a 1.00% coupon, creating quite a talking point at the time with many wondering why anyone would want to buy a corporate bond with a 1.00% coupon. Today, a 1.00% coupon does not even make the top 20 three-year bucket which currently cuts off at 0.875%. Prior to that, low-coupon record breaking was really not much of a sport. The game really kicked off when Wal-Mart broke low coupon records in five-year, 10-year and 30-year maturities with a USD3bn deal that priced on June 30, 2010. Wal-Mart’s records were a 2.25% five-year (record now 1.00%), a 3.625% 10-year (record now 1.875%) and a 4.875% 30-year (record now 3.375%). US Treasury yields remained close to record lows on Wednesday amid worry about global growth and concerns that Spain will need a huge financial bailout on top of a bank rescue package already in place.

249,IBM,Cemex to outsource jobs in biggest Mexican deal for IBM,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s top cement maker Cemex is outsourcing jobs worldwide to IBM in a deal that will help it save $1 billion over 10 years, the latest bid by the company to trim costs and boost its financial health. Cemex, which was swamped by the collapse of the U.S. housing market after paying out some $16 billion to buy Australian peer Rinker, has been working its way out of a deep debt hole for the past three years. Cemex Chief Financial Officer Fernando Gonzalez told Reuters that the deal with International Business Machines Corp would likely affect between 1,500 and 2,000 staff, but he said that was a preliminary estimate. The company did not give specifics about the types of jobs that would be outsourced. Some jobs may be absorbed by IBM, Gonzalez said. Cemex will start passing jobs to IBM from September, and the entire transition should be complete by December 2013. “Starting 2014 is when we will have a full year of savings ... that we hope should be of more than $100 million per year,” Gonzalez said, adding that final numbers for the outsourcing plan would not be public until later this year. The contract is IBM’s largest outsourcing deal with a Mexican company and ranks among the biggest IBM has agreed in Latin America, said Bob Hoey, general manager for IBM’s integrated technology services business. By cutting costs and its debt burden, Cemex is getting back on its feet. Two weeks ago, the company posted its highest quarterly operating core profit in nearly three years on a pickup in its U.S. business. Monterrey-based Cemex employs about 42,000 people worldwide and has operations in over 50 countries. IBM will provide Cemex with business process and information technology services. It will also include finance and accounting, and human resources back-office services. “While $1 billion sounds pretty attractive, and it is definitely good news for the company, we won’t see the real benefits until they get reflected in their profits,” said Norma Lopez, an analyst with brokerage Multivalores. Cemex is extending the maturity on a big chunk of its debt, which would help it dodge a maturity tsunami of $7.25 billion in early 2014, as it struggles with a stagnant construction market. Cemex has proposed a debt exchange to lenders - selling assets, a pre-payment and revised financial covenants to gain breathing space. The proposal, announced in late June, has been negotiated with half of the creditors. The exchange offer is due on August 20. So far, Cemex has reported strong participation by lenders. Gonzalez said Cemex was reviewing operations worldwide to spot the ones that could be sold entirely, but it is open to unloading minority stakes, too. He declined to comment on which operations were being reviewed. Cemex shares traded down 2.44 percent to 9.61 pesos on Monday afternoon, while its New York-traded stock slipped 2.95 percent to $7.23.

252,IBM,Cemex to outsource jobs in biggest Mexican deal for IBM,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s top cement maker Cemex is outsourcing jobs worldwide to IBM in a deal that will help it save $1 billion over 10 years, the latest bid by the company to trim costs and boost its financial health. Cemex, which was swamped by the collapse of the U.S. housing market after paying out some $16 billion to buy Australian peer Rinker, has been working its way out of a deep debt hole for the past three years. Cemex Chief Financial Officer Fernando Gonzalez told Reuters that the outsourcing deal with International Business Machines Corp would likely affect between 1,500 and 2,000 jobs, which he said was a preliminary estimate. Some of those jobs may be absorbed by IBM, Gonzalez said. Cemex will start passing jobs to IBM from September, and the entire transition should be complete by December 2013. The company declined to give specifics about the types of jobs that would be outsourced or say where it would take place. Monterrey-based Cemex, employs about 42,000 people worldwide and has operations in over 50 countries. It was not clear if jobs in Mexico would be affected. “Starting 2014 is when we will have a full year of savings ... that we hope should be of more than $100 million per year,” Gonzalez said, adding that final numbers for the outsourcing plan would not be public until later this year.

IBM will provide Cemex with business process and information technology services. It will also include finance and accounting, and human resources back-office services. Mexico has kept labor costs in check over the past decade and manufacturing has helped to power the economy, which last year outperformed Brazil for the first time in years. Latin America’s second-biggest economy is expected to grow faster than Brazil again in 2012, and Mexico has been attracting new factories as rising Chinese wages make Mexico, with its proximity to the United States, more attractive.

258,IBM,IBM launches research centre in Kenya,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - U.S. computer services company IBM and Kenya have opened a research lab they hope will save the country billions of dollars by developing technology to improve delivery of public services. While IBM did not say how much it would invest, Robert Morris, vice president for services research, said on Monday it would be a “significant” amount. Globally, IBM ploughs about $6.5 billion per year research and development. Kenya will contribute $2 million annually over five years, information and communication permanent secretary Bitange Ndemo said, with copyrights for resulting works being shared.

262,IBM,IBM enters HR web applications market with Kenexa buy,"(Reuters) - IBM Corp will buy Kenexa Corp for about $1.3 billion to enter the human resources software market in a move that would likely increase competition with Oracle Corp and SAP AG who recently bought into the sector. The deal underpins the importance that slow-growing technology giants place on faster-growing, web-based software makers, whose products are less vulnerable to the economic downturn as there are no upfront costs for program licenses, dedicated hardware or installation. Germany’s SAP bought Kenexa’s competitor SuccessFactors for $3.4 billion in cash last December, while Oracle bought rival Taleo Corp for about $1.9 billion in February. The two companies made other cloud purchases, including RightNow Technologies and Ariba Inc. “IBM is widely regarded as a social enterprise thought leader, though monetization has been largely concentrated around services,” Credit Agricole Securities analyst Ed Maguire said in a note. “With 80 percent of revenue from subscriptions and a substantial consulting component, Kenexa advances IBM’s strategy toward higher-value software as a service and domain expertise.” Kenexa shares jumped nearly 42 percent, equaling the premium offered, to a life high of $45.92 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. Shares of peer Cornerstone OnDemand Inc were up 7 percent at $26.82 in afternoon trading. The acquisition suggests that IBM is ready to find a foothold in the fiercely competitive market for delivering business applications via the web. It brings the company face-to face against close partner SAP and rivals Oracle and Salesforce.com Inc, the largest maker of web-based software in a crowded market. “This is a big step,” said Nucleus Research analyst Rebecca Wettemann. The move makes it clear that IBM is serious about taking on Oracle, SAP and Salesforce.com in the business applications market, the analyst said. “This brings the arms race up a notch.” As well as the big firms, there are plenty of private producers of HR software, such as Silicon Valley Workday, founded by ex-PeopleSoft executives, which filed for an initial public offering recently. IBM is expanding in the fast-growing field of delivering business applications through the Web as its new CEO Ginni Rometty looks to make her imprint on the 100-year-old company that is widely considered one of the world’s most conservative computer technology firms. “IBM has previously suggested the return on software acquisitions is the best it has seen in recent years. We expect continued acquisition activity this year,” ISI Group analyst Brian Marshall said in a note. IBM has focused its highly profitable software division on email, databases, operating systems and “middleware” — programs that make up the plumbing of computer networks. It has shied away from selling applications such as human resources software. “Following Oracle’s move into hardware and SAP’s move into the database market, both of which position these leading apps companies more in IBM’s traditional markets, IBM has perhaps fewer reservations about participating in the apps and software-as-a-service market,” Nomura analysts said. “The Kenexa acquisition will complement IBM’s social business and HR business services leadership,” IBM said, adding that it expects the transaction to close in the fourth quarter. Kenexa has more than 8,900 customers across financial services, pharmaceuticals, retail and consumer industries, it said. Lazard served as financial adviser for Kenexa on the deal, while Pepper Hamilton LLP was its legal adviser.

265,IBM,IBM to roll out new mainframes despite shrinking market,"BOSTON (Reuters) - IBM will unveil a new version of its iconic mainframe computer on Tuesday, adding new security and data analytics features as it struggles to stem declines in the sluggish market for high-end business computers. International Business Machines Corp is the dominant provider of mainframe computers, selling machines that run on powerful microprocessors of its own design and priced starting at about $1 million. Its chief competitors are high-end servers from Hewlett-Packard Co and Oracle Corp. IBM said it spent more than $1 billion developing the updated machines, focusing on efforts to boost their computing performance, capacity and features. Analysts said existing customers are likely to appreciate the new bells and whistles. But they cautioned it will be tough for IBM to win new clients as most businesses are already enamored of cheaper technology that is widely considered “good enough” for all but the most mission-critical tasks. “It’s going to be harder and harder for IBM to find new customers and new opportunities for the mainframe,” said Charles King, an analyst with technology research firm Pund-IT. Officials with IBM said the company has “thousands” of mainframe customers around the globe but declined to be more specific. Gartner estimates that annual global sales of mainframes will fall this year and each year through 2016, declining a total of 14 percent over the five years to nearly $4.7 billion. Shipments of the new product begin next month. Mainframe sales typically pick up for several quarters after a product launch due to pent up demand from customers waiting for the newest technology. Gartner analyst Jeffrey Hewitt said current mainframe customers are likely to stick with the technology. That group includes government agencies, financial services companies and other businesses that require tremendous computing power, extreme speed and very high reliability for certain tasks such as processing credit card transactions. Yet he said that demand will grow at a brisk pace for less-expensive servers running on x86 chips from Intel Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Software makers have developed technology in recent years that enables companies to combine those servers into clusters capable of managing some tasks once handled only by mainframes. Gartner forecasts that sales of x86 servers will surge 10 percent this year to $39 billion. In the five years to 2016, annual sales of those machines will climb a total of 33 percent to $47 billion, or more than 10 times the mainframe market according to the firm’s forecasts.

273,IBM,"IBM aims for Amazon, Salesforce.com with midsize cloud plan - WSJ","Sept 26 (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp  will announce on Wednesday that it will ramp up efforts to sell cloud computing services to midsize businesses, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. The move by IBM, a bellwether for the IT industry because of its global span and breadth of businesses, is aimed at grabbing market share from companies like Amazon.com Inc and Salesforce.com Inc, which have been successful in the mid-market, the paper said. For Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM, midsize companies refer to those with less than 1,000 employees, the newspaper said. The company’s general manager in charge of small and medium-sized businesses, Andy Monshaw, told the Journal that the cheaper cost of cloud computing will let the company reach a bigger base of smaller customers.

274,IBM,"HP's outlook disappoints, shares hit nine-year low","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co’s (HPQ.N) shares plunged to a nine-year low on Wednesday after Chief Executive Meg Whitman warned of an unexpectedly steep earnings slide in 2013, with revenue set to fall in every business division except software. Wall Street had hoped for quicker signs of progress on Whitman’s turnaround plan, which centers on transforming the former industry powerhouse into an enterprise computing corporation that can take on IBM (IBM.N) and Dell Inc DELL.O. Whitman, who took the helm of HP just over a year ago after a failed bid to become governor of California, told investors that the company’s recovery would start to become visible only in fiscal 2014, when investments begin to pay off. She blamed unprecedented executive turnover in past years for dragging out the Silicon Valley company’s turnaround. Analysts say HP is struggling to shore up its credibility on Wall Street while battling crumbling margins in an increasingly cut-throat PC arena, tapering-off of IT spending, and an internal organizational overhaul that involves thousands of layoffs. “I was surprised that nothing new was really said in terms of strategy, and the problem here is there is lack of investor confidence in the current strategy,” said Shaw Wu, an analyst with Sterne Agee. Shares of HP, the largest U.S. technology company by sales, tumbled 13 percent on Wednesday in the biggest single-day decline since August 2011. Shares of some of HP’s contract makers in Asia also fell when trading opened there on Thursday. HP gave a particularly gloomy outlook for enterprise services, its business providing services to corporations and a key component of Whitman’s rescue plan. Revenue from that division will dive 11 to 13 percent in fiscal 2013 and be barely profitable, with operating margins of zero to 3 percent. That stands in stark contrast to IBM (IBM.N), which raised its full-year earnings outlook, reflecting its ability to manage costs, despite flat software revenue in the second quarter and a 2 percent decline in services. Whitman became HP’s third CEO in as many years after taking over following Leo Apotheker’s abrupt dismissal just over one year ago. She is trying to revitalize the former industry icon via layoffs, cost cutting, and expansion into areas with longer-term potential such as enterprise computing services. “The single biggest challenge facing Hewlett-Packard has been changes in CEOs and executive leadership, which has caused multiple inconsistent strategic choices, and frankly some significant executional miscues,” Whitman told the investor conference in San Francisco. “This is important because as a result it is going to take longer to right this ship than any of us would like,” she added. HP has lost more than two-thirds of its value since 2010, when its capitalization topped out at about $104.5 billion. Squeezed by crumbling demand for personal computers in a mobile era, significant leadership turbulence, and the advent of Apple Inc’s iPad that year, HP’s stock embarked on a steady decline. The company now has a market value around $30 billion. Since Whitman took the helm in September 2011, the stock has fallen about 35 percent. HP has suffered through years of turbulence. Apotheker’s 11-month tenure was marked by an acceleration of departures from various divisions, such as networking chief Marius Haas, as he brought in former coworkers from SAP AG (SAPG.DE). Apotheker’s predecessor, Mark Hurd, who is now president of Oracle Corp ORCL.O, also departed abruptly, after a sexual harassment scandal. HP, like rival Dell, is trying to transform itself into a major enterprise computing provider in the mold of IBM, while slashing expenses to boost the bottom line. Shares of Dell, the No. 2 U.S. PC maker after HP, fell 4.7 percent on Wednesday, mired near nine-year lows. HP is laying off 29,000 employees over the next two years and has written off $10.8 billion mostly related to the writedown of its EDS services business. Meantime, its business continues to be hit by a slowing in corporate spending and personal computer demand worldwide. For 2013, the company forecast overall earnings, excluding restructuring charges and other items, at between $3.40 to $3.60 a share in fiscal 2013. That’s well below the average forecast by Wall Street analyst of $4.18, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. A large part of the shortfall rests on the projected plunge in enterprise revenue, a division that sells myriad services to businesses and has seen an erosion in profitability. Operating profit fell 22 percent in the July quarter, surpassed only by a 28 percent slump in personal computers. Mike Nefkens, HP’s acting global enterprise leader ,said fiscal 2013 “will be a fix and build year.” “We expect long-term growth to be back in the 3-5 percent range and long-term profit to be in the 7-9 percent range,” he said. The heads of other business units also addressed Wednesday’s conference, touting both new products and challenges facing the groups. HP is battling formidable rivals on several fronts, particularly in cloud, or remote computing, products and services, with Oracle and IBM aggressively courting corporate customers. China’s Lenovo Group Ltd (0992.HK) may overtake HP as the world’s biggest PC seller this year. “Asian brands will continue to outperform western brands,” said Angela Hsiang, a Taiwan-based analyst at KGI Securities. “Western brands in general are lagging their Asian peers in terms of grabbing market share in fast-growing emerging markets.” Reflecting that brighter outlook, Lenovo shares were not badly hit by HP’s profit warning, falling less than 1 percent. But Taiwan’s Quanta Computer Inc (2382.TW) and Compal Electronics Inc (2324.TW), both contract makers for HP, suffered more, with their shares dropping around 4 percent in Taipei. Whitman vowed to reduce the number of product offerings and to cut costs as HP tries to recover in a worsening macro-economic environment. She has said it will take five years for the turnaround to be effective. “All of this is fixable but it is going to take some time,” she said. She said HP eventually will have to compete in the smartphone market, but stopped short of laying out a plan and said there were no plans to introduce a smartphone in 2013. Longer term, HP expects “to be a GDP-like growth company with key pockets of higher growth,” said Cathie Lesjak, HP’s chief financial officer. Its stock closed down 13 percent at $14.91 on the New York Stock Exchange.

277,IBM,"IBM revenue hurt by strong dollar, tight IT budgets","(Reuters) - IBM posted a quarterly revenue miss and barely beat analyst expectations for earnings per share as customers put off spending on big ticket items and a stronger dollar hit the company’s top line. Businesses and governments are holding back on spending on information technology amid economic uncertainty in Europe and ahead of U.S. elections next month. International Business Machines Corp, which has shifted its focus to higher-margin software and services from tech products, said on Tuesday that earnings per share, excluding items, were $3.62, just beating average analysts’ estimates of $3.61. Excluding a $160 million charge related to UK pension fees net income fell slightly to $3.82 billion from $3.84 billion a year ago while net income, excluding acquisition costs, rose 5 percent to $4.2 billion. Revenue eased 5 percent to $24.7 billion due to a negative currency impact of almost $1 billion. Wall Street had expected a decline in revenue by about 3 percent to $25.36 billion. “If you look at the third quarter performance, we did start off the first two months of the quarter on a stronger trajectory than we saw for the full quarter,” Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on a call with analysts. He added “a handful of deals ... fell out of the quarter” which the company had thought were secure. The CFO also said that several large countries had disappointed with Mexico and Australia “both down double digits.” Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry said that some customers are holding off with purchases ahead of the U.S. presidential election, going ahead only with smaller purchases instead of replacing entire systems. “Customers are just not opening their wallets,” he said. “That is putting pressure on IT spend.” Forester analyst Andrew Bartels agreed, saying that CEOs were waiting for clarity on “whether the fiscal cliff will be avoided and when will Europe finally turn the corner.” Fiscal cliff refers to the impact of around $600 billion in tax hikes and automatic spending cuts set for 2013 as a result of successive failures by Congress to agree on an orderly alternative method of reducing U.S. budget deficits. Bartels added that the third quarter would likely be IBM’s weakest quarter. Revenue from IBM’s EMEA region, which includes Europe, Middle East and Africa were $7.2 billion, down 9 percent, without adjusting for foreign exchange effects. In the Americas revenue declined 4 percent to $10.4 billion while Asia-Pacific revenue rose 1 percent to $6.5 billion. The company said its services backlog at September 30 was $138 billion, up 1 percent year-over-year, while signings of services contracts were $13.3 billion versus estimates of $12.4 billion. Investors view signings as a key indicator of future profits, but IBM says the focus should be more on the total business backlog because it is a better sign of future revenue. IBM reiterated its outlook for the year, targeting earnings per share of at least $15.10. IBM stock lost 3.31 percent to $204 in after hours trading. It closed up 1 percent at $211 on Tuesday.

Homebuilders’ shares climbed after data showed groundbreaking on new homes jumped 15 percent in September, the quickest pace since July 2008 - in a sign that the housing sector’s budding recovery is supporting the broader economy. But both Intel Corp and International Business Machines Corp tumbled a day after they reported results, keeping the Dow negative. IBM alone caused a drag of nearly 88 points on the blue-chip average. Intel also pulled on the Nasdaq 100 The S&P; technology sector index lost 1 percent. Intel gave a weak fourth-quarter revenue outlook while IBM posted third-quarter revenue that came in under expectations. Intel dropped 3.1 percent to $21.65 while IBM lost 5.8 percent to $198.73. Both were among the biggest drags on the Dow. Intel also weighed on the Nasdaq. Bank of America shares slipped 0.5 percent to $9.41 after the second-largest U.S. bank said earnings per share were break-even and down sharply from the year-ago period. Shares of M&T; Bank jumped 5 percent to $102.22 after the company posted third-quarter results, helping push the KBW Bank index up 1.1 percent. Financial companies’ earnings have yielded mixed results so far. Earlier this week, results from Citigroup and Goldman Sachs indicated improvement in the financial sector, though those reports followed disappointments from JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo. Earnings “expectations were extremely conservative, and the results are just not that bad at all. And whenever people begin to get too far in one direction - meaning earnings are going to be terrible - generally reality is better than that, and we are seeing that now,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 33.22 points, or 0.25 percent, to 13,518.56. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 2.25 points, or 0.15 percent, to 1,457.17.

It’s not going to roar higher, but that is a good thing,” Ghriskey said. The S&P; 500 achieved its best two-day advance in a month, a rise of 1.8 percent through Tuesday’s close, on the heels of last week’s drop - its worst weekly decline in four months. Expectations for a disappointing earnings season, which prompted the last week’s slide, have been tempered this week as more companies post quarterly results. According to Thomson Reuters data through Wednesday morning, quarterly earnings for S&P; 500 components are now expected to fall 1.7 percent from a year ago.

U.S. and German government debt prices fell after Spain avoided a damaging ratings downgrade from Moody’s and stronger-than-expected U.S. housing data pointed to an improving economy,  which reduced safe-haven demand. Growing speculation that Spain will ask for a bailout next month lifted the euro. A possible line of credit to Spain and some easing of German opposition to aid for Greece and Spain were also likely to support the euro in the near term. Wall Street opened mixed, with the Dow pulled lower by Intel and IBM. But the Nasdaq rebounded to climb higher, building on the best two-day advance for U.S. stocks in a month. Intel slumped 1.9 percent to $21.92 while IBM lost 3.8 percent to $203.05. Both were among the biggest drags on the Dow and Nasdaq 100. “These are some fairly big disappointments, and while we think we’ll see better results out of tech, it’s clear the market doesn’t think we’ll see much growth in names like Intel or IBM,” said Richard Sichel, who oversees $1.8 billion as chief investment officer at Philadelphia Trust Co.

The Nasdaq Composite Index  was up 3.28 points, or 0.11 percent, at 3,104.46. MSCI’s all-country world equity index rose 0.7 percent to 337.82, extending Tuesday’s 1.2 percent gain. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index of top European shares gained just 0.4 percent to 1,117.77. European shares rose for a third consecutive session after Spain clung to its top grade credit rating, bolstering expectations the euro debt crisis can be contained. “Spain is in a better place for now,” said Richard Robinson, a fund manager at Ashburton who recently bought shares of Spanish bank Bankinter and Italian bank Intesa  on prospects of improved euro zone economic problems. The euro was up 0.5 percent at $1.3117, its highest since mid-September. Bond losses accelerated after data showed that groundbreaking on new U.S. homes surged in September to its fastest pace in more than four years, another sign that the housing sector’s budding recovery is gaining traction. “The housing starts and permits are both up a ton. The market was already selling off, it started overnight with Moody’s affirming Spain’s investment grade rating,” said James Newman, head of Treasuries and Agency trading at Keefe, Bruyette and Woods in New York.

286,IBM,"GLOBAL MARKETS-Euro, shares gain as Spain dodges rating downgrade","* Euro hits 1-month high as Moody’s affirms Spain rating * Government debt prices fall on Spanish outlook, U.S. housing * U.S. stocks rise, but Intel, IBM weigh on equity market By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose and the euro hit a one-month high on Wednesday, helped by brighter prospects for resolving Spain’s debt woes, but disappointing quarterly earnings from Intel Corp and IBM weighed on U.S. equity markets. U.S. and German government debt prices fell after Spain avoided a damaging ratings downgrade from Moody’s and stronger-than-expected U.S. housing data pointed to an improving economy,  which reduced safe-haven demand. Growing speculation that Spain will ask for a bailout next month lifted the euro. A possible line of credit to Spain and some easing of German opposition to aid for Greece and Spain were also likely to support the euro in the near term. Wall Street opened mixed, with the Dow pulled lower by Intel and IBM. But the Nasdaq rebounded to climb higher, building on the best two-day advance for U.S. stocks in a month. Intel slumped 1.9 percent to $21.92 while IBM lost 3.8 percent to $203.05. Both were among the biggest drags on the Dow and Nasdaq 100. “These are some fairly big disappointments, and while we think we’ll see better results out of tech, it’s clear the market doesn’t think we’ll see much growth in names like Intel or IBM,” said Richard Sichel, who oversees $1.8 billion as chief investment officer at Philadelphia Trust Co. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 5.49 points, or 0.04 percent, at 13,546.29. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up 5.19 points, or 0.36 percent, at 1,460.11. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 7.29 points, or 0.24 percent, at 3,108.46. MSCI’s all-country world equity index rose 0.7 percent to 337.99, extending Tuesday’s 1.2 percent gain. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index of top European shares gained just 0.4 percent to 1,117.14. The euro was up 0.6 percent at $1.3123, its highest since mid-September. Bond losses accelerated after data showed that groundbreaking on new U.S. homes surged in September to its fastest pace in more than four years, another sign that the housing sector’s budding recovery is gaining traction. “The housing starts and permits are both up a ton. The market was already selling off, it started overnight with Moody’s affirming Spain’s investment grade rating,” said James Newman, head of Treasuries and Agency trading at Keefe, Bruyette and Woods in New York. Benchmark 10-year notes fell 16/32 in price to yield 1.78 percent, the highest since Sept. 21.

287,IBM,"US STOCKS-Wall St edges higher, but tech weighs","* Intel and IBM slump after results, weigh on Dow * Bank of America shares volatile in heavy trading * Housing starts surge in Sept, lifting homebuilders * Dow down 0.1 pct, S&P; up 0.3 pct, Nasdaq up 0.2 pct By Ryan Vlastelica NEW YORK, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The S&P; 500 edged higher for its third straight day of gains on Wednesday, lifted by signs of strength in the housing market, but gains were limited by weak tech company results. Both Intel Corp and IBM tumbled a day after they reported results, keeping the Dow in negative territory as IBM alone contributed a 66-point drag to the blue chip average. Intel gave a weak fourth-quarter revenue outlook while IBM posted third-quarter revenue that came in under expectations. Intel slumped 3.8 percent to $21.49 while IBM lost 4.5 percent to $201.48. Both were among the biggest drags on the Dow and Nasdaq. “These are some fairly big disappointments, and while we think we’ll see better results out of tech, it’s clear the market doesn’t think we’ll see much growth in names like Intel or IBM,” said Richard Sichel, who oversees $1.8 billion as chief investment officer at Philadelphia Trust Co. Bank of America rose 0.7 percent in a volatile session after reporting breakeven results, which were sharply lower from the previous year. The results did little to clarify the strength of the financial sector. Earlier this week, results from Citigroup  and Goldman Sachs indicated improvement in the group, though those reports came after disappointments from JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. Homebuilder Toll Brothers climbed 3 percent to $34.97 after housing starts surged to the fastest pace in four years while D.R. Horton gained 3.7 percent to $21.52. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 6.38 points, or 0.05 percent, at 13,545.40. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up 4.62 points, or 0.32 percent, at 1,459.54. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 5.58 points, or 0.18 percent, at 3,106.75. The S&P; just notched its best two-day advance in a month, a rise of 1.8 percent. Those gains came as some disappointments early in the earnings season were offset by strong results from such bellwethers as Johnson & Johnson. Earnings for S&P; 500 components are seen falling 2.4 percent from a year ago, with the main culprit the slowing global economy, according to Thomson Reuters data. With 11 percent of S&P; companies having reported, 64 percent have beaten earnings expectations, slightly less than the average for the past four quarters. Apollo Group Inc plummeted 17 percent to $22.85 as the S&P;’s biggest decliner a day after giving a weak 2013 outlook.

288,IBM,Brokerages cut IBM's ratings on revenue troubles,"* Societe Generale, Janney Capital cut ratings on IBM * BMO cuts price target to $218 from $222 * Shares down 4 percent premarket Oct 17 (Reuters) - IBM Corp’s fifth consecutive quarterly revenue miss prompted at least two brokerages to cut their ratings on the company’s stock. Shares of IBM, considered a bellwether for the global enterprise IT sector, were down 4 percent at $202.50 before the bell on Wednesday. International Business Machines Corp’s third-quarter revenue missed estimates as customers put off spending on big ticket items and also due to a stronger dollar. Sluggish spending environment in North America is a concern because the deceleration seems to be gathering pace, Societe Generale analyst Richard Nguyen said. Revenue from the Americas, which accounts for 42 percent of total revenue, fell 4 percent in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Nguyen cut his rating on the stock to “sell” from “hold”. Several other large countries also disappointed in the quarter, with Mexico and Australia “both down double digits,” the company said on a conference call on Tuesday. IBM’s results face headwinds in the short term from more than just macro factors as its business services revenue — 18 percent of total revenue — has declined in the last three quarters despite stable demand from Japan, one of its major overseas markets, Janney Capital Markets analyst Joseph Foresi wrote in a note. He lowered his rating on the stock to “neutral” from “buy”. Services revenue growth remains challenged and management’s commentary around future growth was fairly subdued, Robert W. Baird & Co said in a note. J.P. Morgan Securities analyst John DiFucci said “IBM’s ... lackluster growth are a cautionary sign for business momentum in the software sector, especially given management’s comments around a weak September and slipped deals.” IBM’s roadmap to achieve a profit of $20 per share for financial year 2015 depends much on cost cuts and share buyback programs, rather than revenue growth, BMO Capital Markets analyst Keith Bachman said. The company reported a profit of $13.44 per share for 2011. However, Credit Suisse said IBM’s transition to higher-value services, increased operational efficiency and targeted M&A; should allow for a steady march to $20 per share in earnings, if not more. The company has shifted its focus to higher-margin software and services from tech products.

Bank of America Corp shares rose 1.8 percent to $9.63 in premarket trading after reporting $340 million in net earnings, or nil per share. Analysts estimates were for a per-share loss. Citigroup and Goldman Sachs posted strong results this week, also indicating improvement in the financial sector. But JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo  disappointed investors. Tech shares were pressured a day after both Intel Corp  and IBM reported disappointing quarterly results, sending the stocks sharply down before the opening bell. “There was a lot of pessimism going into earnings season, but overall I’m happy with what I’m seeing. Things seem to be improving for banks,” said Scott Schermerhorn, chief investment officer at Granite Investment Advisors in Concord, New Hampshire. “IBM and Intel were weak, but it isn’t surprising to see such globally exposed companies hit by weakness in Europe and emerging markets.” S&P; 500 futures rose 3.1 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures rose 10 points while Nasdaq 100 futures fell 1.75 points. Equities are coming off their best two-day advance in a month, a rise of 1.8 percent. Those gains came as some disappointments early in the earnings season were offset by strong results from such bellwethers as Johnson & Johnson . Still, the first report cards from companies in the tech sector suggested reasons for caution. Late Tuesday, Intel gave a weak fourth-quarter revenue outlook while IBM posted third-quarter revenue that came in under expectations. The tech sector is closely monitored because it is one measures of business spending. Intel fell 4 percent to $21.45 in premarket while IBM lost 4.1 percent to $202.45. Both firms are Dow components. Earnings for S&P; 500 components are seen falling 2.3 percent from a year ago, with the main culprite the slowing global economy. But the latest forecast does mark a slight improvement from estimates last week, according to Thomson Reuters data. PepsiCo reported a drop in third-quarter earnings, hurt by a stronger U.S. dollar, while Textron’s earnings missed expectations, though it raised its full-year profit view. ASML agreed to buy Cymer, its key supplier of a light-based technology crucial to making a new generation of much smaller chips, for $2.5 billion. The stock surged 65 percent to $79 before the bell.

297,IBM,Chemicals producer Avantor sues IBM over software project,"Nov 9 (Reuters) - Avantor Performance Materials has filed a lawsuit against IBM for fraud and breach of contract over the implementation of a software project that resulted in a “disaster” for the chemicals manufacturer. The company, which produces chemicals and raw materials for pharmaceutical products, laboratory chemicals and chemicals used in the electronics industry, said in a statement that it was seeking tens of million in damages from IBM. According to the lawsuit filed on Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, Avantor said IBM had misrepresented the capabilities of a software program that runs on a platform by SAP, resulting “in a near standstill” of Avantor’s business. IBM, which partners with German business software maker SAP  in its consulting business, was not immediately available for comment. Avantor in 2010 chose to replace its legacy information technology systems with a global SAP roll-out as part of a rebranding and growth strategy. Contrary to IBM’s pre-contract representations, Avantor said  the software program “was woefully unsuited to Avantor’s business, and could not provide crucial functionality that Avantor needed to run its core business processes”. Avantor also called IBM’s consultants “incompetent and inexperienced”. When the system went live, Avantor said it was a disaster due to a number of errors ranging from failure to track or process orders correctly to directing “that dangerous chemicals be stored in inappropriate locations”. According to the lawsuit, IBM received around $13 million in fees and was asking for more to remedy the issues around the software implementation.",11092012,http://www.reuters.com/article/avantor-ibm-lawsuit/chemicals-producer-avantor-sues-ibm-over-software-project-idUSL1E8M9BS220121109

Obama was scheduled to meet labor and civic leaders on Tuesday, followed by a meeting with business executives on Wednesday. A White House official said the leaders would discuss “the best ways to move our economy forward and find a balanced approach to reduce the deficit.” Unless the president and lawmakers agree, a combination of tax increases and government spending cuts will take effect in early 2013, the so-called fiscal cliff that would reduce the deficit but harm the U.S. economy.

303,IBM,Online shopping grows after US holiday store traffic ebbs,"Nov 25 (Reuters) - Internet sales continued to grow through the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday weekend, feeding overall transactions even as traffic to stores likely slowed after a strong, early start. In the latest sign of the growing importance of Internet-based retailing, comScore Inc said “Black Friday” online sales topped $1 billion for the first time, while IBM said online sales rose 16.9 percent year-over-year on Saturday. Staying open on Thanksgiving became more widespread this year as retailers such as Target Corp, Sears Holdings Corp and Toys R Us Inc joined in, while others including Wal-Mart and Gap Inc either extended their operating hours or had more stores doing business. Traditionally, stores had waited until Black Friday, the day after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, to make their big push. IBM, in a survey, said 24 percent of shoppers used a mobile device to visit a retailer’s website on Black Friday, and 25.5 percent did so on Saturday. Overall sales, however, were likely to have flattened slightly. The number of consumers using their mobile device to make a purchase was up over Black Friday, reaching 16.7 percent versus 16.3 percent, IBM said. “Overall Saturday sales are probably up 1 or 2 percent after the 3 or 4 percent on Thursday and Friday,” said Steve Krenzer, chief executive of shopping comparison website PriceGrabber. “Sales for the overall weekend will be up 3 percent, but some of Thursday and Friday’s gains will come at Saturday’s expense,” he said. Krenzer said that this year, 13-14 percent of consumers indicated they would spend more this holiday season against 80 percent or more who said they would spend the same or less than last year. “When you see strong sales on Thursday and Friday, you know it is going to come from later in the weekend or later in the season,” he added. Consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of U.S. economic activity. Hard data for sales and traffic trends for the weekend will not be available until later in the day and week, but initial readings suggested that for all the early Thanksgiving deals, those extra hours may not have led to a huge boost in sales. The National Retail Federation expects sales in November and December to rise 4.1 percent this year, below last year’s 5.6 percent increase. As the spending pool contracts, it becomes more important for retailers to strategize as they battle each other, rather than seeing a growing pie in a season when they can make a third of their annual sales and 40 to 50 percent of their profits. “The early opening is very important to gain or maintain market share in the competitive landscape, but it will not generate a breakthrough spike in year-over-year spending for the overall holidays,” PriceGrabber’s Krenzer said. Analysts at Shoppertrak, which analyzes store traffic, said though the number of shoppers visiting physical stores rose 3.5 percent on Black Friday, retail sales fell 1.8 percent that day.",11252012,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-retail-holiday-weekend/online-shopping-grows-after-us-holiday-store-traffic-ebbs-idUSL4N0950AM20121125

307,IBM,Two charged with insider trading over 2009 IBM deal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two former stock brokers at a Connecticut financial services company were charged with insider trading on Thursday over a 2009 acquisition by computer giant IBM Corp. U.S. authorities said Thomas Conradt, David Weishaus and three unnamed colleagues made more than $1 million in illicit gains by trading in shares of SPSS Inc before IBM agreed on July 28, 2009, to buy the Chicago-based software company for $1.2 billion. Prosecutors said the alleged scheme started with a tip from an associate at the New York law firm that represented IBM in the transaction. Prosecutors did not name the law firm, but regulatory documents listed Cravath Swaine & Moore as counsel to IBM in the deal. “Thomas Conradt, David Weishaus and their co-conspirators engaged in a chain of illegal tipping simply because they wanted to get rich quick,” U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan said in a statement. Conradt, 34, is a lawyer living in Denver, while Weishaus, 32, lives in Baltimore. Both were formerly employed at Euro Pacific Capital Inc, a Westport, Connecticut-based firm, according to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Sharon Feldman, a lawyer for Conradt, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Michael Grudberg, a lawyer for Weishaus, declined to comment. Evan Chesler, presiding partner of Cravath, declined comment. IBM and Euro Pacific Capital did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Conradt and Weishaus were arrested on Thursday morning, an FBI spokesman said. Each was charged with three counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy in an indictment unsealed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. If convicted, they face up to 20 years in prison and a $5 million fine on each of the securities fraud counts. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed related civil fraud charges against both men. IBM agreed to pay $50 per share for SPSS, a 42 percent premium to SPSS’ closing price on the day before the purchase was announced. According to court papers, Conradt’s roommate, an Australian equities analyst, had learned about the pending acquisition from a close friend, a New Zealand citizen who worked as an associate at the New York law firm. Investigators said Conradt then tipped Weishaus, who in turn tipped three colleagues, who were not named in court papers. These five people placed the various improper trades in SPSS stock and options, according to the court papers. The indictment outlines a series of instant messages involving the defendants that prosecutors said reflect their involvement in the improper trades. In one exchange, according to the indictment, Conradt on July 1, 2009, told Weishaus, “Jesus, don’t tell anyone else ... we gotta keep this in the family”. Weishaus then said, “I don’t want to go to jail,” and said “Martha Stewart spent 5 months in the slammer,” referring to the homemaking doyenne, who was convicted in 2004 on charges of lying to investigators about a stock sale. He also alluded to an SEC insider-trading case against Mark Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks pro basketball team. The criminal case is U.S. v.

310,IBM,IBM's latest retirement move is bad for workers,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - IBM ads urge us all to follow its lead and help “build a smarter planet.” Let’s hope other companies don’t follow Big Blue’s latest move: an overhaul of its 401(k) plan that shifts its matching contribution to a once-a-year affair. Starting next year, IBM will shift its matching contribution from semi-monthly to a lump sum paid each December 31. Leave the company before December 15, and you’ll get no match at all for the year. Retirement plan experts say it is a clever money-saving move — and one that allows Big Blue to focus its benefit resources on workers who are sticking with the company. For loyal workers, the shift means 11 lost months every year of opportunity for dollar-cost averaged contributions and potential investment growth. And it makes the 401(k) plan less valuable to employees who leave IBM - either on their own or through layoff or disability. They’ll lose the entire match for that year. “This change reflects our continuing commitment to invest in our employee 401(k) plans while maintaining business competitiveness in a challenging economic environment,” said an IBM spokesman. “IBM’s 401(k) plans remain among the best in the industry.” In addition to employer contributions ranging from 6 percent to 10 percent of salary, the spokesman noted that IBM makes automatic contributions even for employees who do not contribute to the plan themselves. IBM is widely viewed as an employee benefits trend-setter. The company last made retirement plan headlines in 2008 when it replaced its defined benefit pension plan with a cutting-edge 401(k) plan featuring very generous matching contributions — depending on hire date and years of service — low fees and access to free financial advice. Today, IBM's 401(k) plan is the largest private sector defined contribution plan in the country, with $37.6 billion in assets. It is the 14th-best, according to the annual ranking of top 30 plans released this week by Brightscope, which rates and analyzes plans (here). “They’re a major trend-setter, so a lot of other companies will be looking very closely at this move,” said Brooks Herman, Brightscope’s head of research. A national trend toward annual matches would be bad news for workers, especially middle- and lower-income households already finding it very difficult to build significant nest eggs through the 401(k) system. IBM’s shift to an annual contribution will save money on matches to employees who leave. “If plan sponsors want to cut spending, they’re going to look at the smartest way to use their resources,” said Alison Borland, vice president of retirement product strategy at Aon Hewitt. “Do I want to focus on long or short service? Do I want to focus on employees who stick around, or those who leave during the year?” The change also will give IBM a big cash flow advantage. “They can time the plan contributions and invest the money elsewhere,” said Roger Wohlner, a financial planner who advises small and medium-sized workplace retirement plans. “I’m sure IBM has some extremely bright treasury and cash management people who figured out this would be a nice windfall.” Aon Hewitt reports that just nine percent of plans make annual lump sum contributions now. “These are plans that just set it up this way years ago,” Borland said. “IBM is the first large company to make a change like this.” IBM’s example could appeal to smaller plans looking to solve a key administrative headache, said Jason Roberts, CEO of the Pension Resource Institute, which provides consulting and training services to retirement plan service providers. “One of the most common Department of Labor rule violations that gets plans in trouble is the burden of segregating matching contributions from payroll,” Roberts said. “That’s not a problem for big, sophisticated companies like IBM, but some small plan sponsors might see an annual contribution as a way to simplify the administrative burden.” Meanwhile, IBM workers have been lighting up the Internet and social media with complaints about the changes, and Alliance@IBM — an employee group affiliated with the Communications Workers of America that is trying to unionize IBM workers — is running a petition drive urging Big Blue to rescind the move. Although workers can continue to make regular payroll contributions and allocate those contributions throughout the year, the shift does mean 11 lost months of opportunity for dollar-cost averaged contributions and potential investment growth of the matching funds. “One thing we are trying instill with plan participants is the importance of staying consistent with your allocations, maintaining the appropriate portfolio mix through rebalancing and the benefit of smoothing volatility through contributions over time,” said Roberts. “This allocates a big chunk of your contribution all at once.” IBM’s 401(k) will be less valuable for any workers who leave IBM, either on their own or through layoff or disability, since they’ll lose an entire year of matching contributions. IBM’s U.S. workforce has shrunk over the past ten years from 160,000 to just 92,000, according to Alliance@IBM, which tracks workforce trends at the company. The workplace group worries the 401(k) changes could prompt the company to lay off workers late in the year to save money on the match. “IBM employees recognize how good the 401(k) plan is, but the company has done a tremendous amount of job outsourcing to places like China and the Philippines. We’re worried this will incentivize IBM to make even more job cuts in the U.S.” said Lee Conrad, Alliance@IBM’s national coordinator. “Would they do a mass layoff just before the date-of record?” asks Wohlner. “I’m not saying IBM is anything but an ethical employer, but if this trend took hold and layoffs occur in early December, you’d have to wonder if that’s part of the reason. It raises a lot of questions.” ",12122012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-column-miller-ibm/ibms-latest-retirement-move-is-bad-for-workers-idUSBRE8BB1QW20121212

Today, IBM’s 401(k) plan is the largest private sector defined contribution plan in the country, with $37.6 billion in assets. It is the 14th-best, according to the annual ranking of top 30 plans released this week by Brightscope, which rates and analyzes plans (). “They’re a major trend-setter, so a lot of other companies will be looking very closely at this move,” said Brooks Herman, Brightscope’s head of research. A national trend toward annual matches would be bad news for workers, especially middle- and lower-income households already finding it very difficult to build significant nest eggs through the 401(k) system. IBM’s shift to an annual contribution will save money on matches to employees who leave. “If plan sponsors want to cut spending, they’re going to look at the smartest way to use their resources,” said Alison Borland, vice president of retirement product strategy at Aon Hewitt. “Do I want to focus on long or short service? Do I want to focus on employees who stick around, or those who leave during the year?” The change also will give IBM a big cash flow advantage. “They can time the plan contributions and invest the money elsewhere,” said Roger Wohlner, a financial planner who advises small and medium-sized workplace retirement plans. “I’m sure IBM has some extremely bright treasury and cash management people who figured out this would be a nice windfall.” Aon Hewitt reports that just nine percent of plans make annual lump sum contributions now. “These are plans that just set it up this way years ago,” Borland said. “IBM is the first large company to make a change like this.” IBM’s example could appeal to smaller plans looking to solve a key administrative headache, said Jason Roberts, CEO of the Pension Resource Institute, which provides consulting and training services to retirement plan service providers. “One of the most common Department of Labor rule violations that gets plans in trouble is the burden of segregating matching contributions from payroll,” Roberts said. “That’s not a problem for big, sophisticated companies like IBM, but some small plan sponsors might see an annual contribution as a way to simplify the administrative burden.” Meanwhile, IBM workers have been lighting up the Internet and social media with complaints about the changes, and Alliance@IBM — an employee group affiliated with the Communications Workers of America that is trying to unionize IBM workers — is running a petition drive urging Big Blue to rescind the move. Although workers can continue to make regular payroll contributions and allocate those contributions throughout the year, the shift does mean 11 lost months of opportunity for dollar-cost averaged contributions and potential investment growth of the matching funds. “One thing we are trying instill with plan participants is the importance of staying consistent with your allocations, maintaining the appropriate portfolio mix through rebalancing and the benefit of smoothing volatility through contributions over time,” said Roberts. “This allocates a big chunk of your contribution all at once.” IBM’s 401(k) will be less valuable for any workers who leave IBM, either on their own or through layoff or disability, since they’ll lose an entire year of matching contributions. IBM’s U.S. workforce has shrunk over the past ten years from 160,000 to just 92,000, according to Alliance@IBM, which tracks workforce trends at the company. The workplace group worries the 401(k) changes could prompt the company to lay off workers late in the year to save money on the match. “IBM employees recognize how good the 401(k) plan is, but the company has done a tremendous amount of job outsourcing to places like China and the Philippines. We’re worried this will incentivize IBM to make even more job cuts in the U.S.” said Lee Conrad, Alliance@IBM’s national coordinator. “Would they do a mass layoff just before the date-of record?” asks Wohlner. “I’m not saying IBM is anything but an ethical employer, but if this trend took hold and layoffs occur in early December, you’d have to wonder if that’s part of the reason. It raises a lot of questions.”",12122012,http://www.reuters.com/article/column-miller-ibm/column-ibms-latest-retirement-move-is-bad-for-workers-idUSL1E8NC4AD20121212

315,IBM,The Unequal State of America: Indiana's rocky road to welfare reform,"INDIANAPOLIS (Reuters) - Indiana’s bold effort to remake welfare got off to a shaky start. In 2006, Gov. Mitch Daniels privatized the management of the welfare-benefits system with a project led by IBM. Two-thirds of Indiana’s social-service agency’s staffers became employees of IBM and its partners. In a process dubbed “welfare modernization,” recipients would apply for benefits online and by phone rather than meeting social workers face to face. It was, by Daniels’s own admission, a failure. Critics accused him of ignoring the lessons of a failed privatization effort in Texas. People were wrongly denied benefits and documents were lost, according to a lawsuit the state filed against IBM. Daniels canceled the IBM contract in 2009. Advocates for the poor say the phone- and Internet-based system proved too difficult for many recipients to navigate because they lacked literacy and computer skills. Opponents also accused the governor’s office of steering work to a company owned by a campaign contributor, Affiliated Computer Services, now owned by Xerox. Daniels and Mitch Roob, an executive at Affiliated before becoming social-services chief, denied any quid pro quo. This July, a Marion County judge awarded $52 million to compensate IBM for cancellation of the contract, castigating the state for “misguided government policy” and IBM for “overzealous corporate ambition.” In an interview, Daniels said the current, revised system - a public-private hybrid - is a success. He cited statistics showing that timeliness and accuracy of benefits have increased. Some recipients agree that the new system is more efficient than the first revamp. Some remain confused by the process and the eligibility rules, however. At one privately run Indiana call center where applicants call in to apply for benefits, the target time for handling each case is 12 minutes, according to an employee who spoke on condition of anonymity. The employee said she handles 35 to 50 calls a day. “Frustrated employees will tell the client anything to just get them off the phone and keep their time down,” the employee said. “We have to take a call, authenticate, find out what they want, answer their questions and wrap up ... all within 12 minutes. It’s kind of like a game show. And people who need food stamps or nursing home care, they are losing out.” Jennifer Wasmer, a spokeswoman for Xerox, which runs the call center, denied there were time targets. She said the average call is 14 minutes, and employees are evaluated primarily on quality, not speed. “The Indiana model is innovative and exemplary,” Wasmer said in a statement. “Things have changed in Indiana for the better.” Daniels, who leaves office in January, said his broader overhaul effort was stymied by the steep recession and by ineffective federal programs. He advocates a reform even bolder than the ones he implemented: Scrap most federal antipoverty benefits and replace them with a “negative income tax.” Championed by the late conservative economist Milton Friedman, the negative tax is simple: Set a minimum income for all Americans, and have the Internal Revenue Service give low earners a payment (a negative tax) that raises their incomes to that level. Recipients would choose how they spend their money. The federal government would save on administrative costs. The market would provide food, housing and health insurance. “I honestly think that something like a negative income tax deserves a closer look,” Daniels said in an interview. “You set a target amount and if a person earns less than that, you top them up.” Given the big rollback of cash aid for the poor in recent years, the idea seems unlikely to fly. President Barack Obama’s medical-insurance overhaul would significantly expand one form of aid to working-age adults, by expanding the availability of Medicaid. His re-election means a Republican attempt to kill his changes is likely to fail. But states such as Indiana have the ability to limit their scope. If Indiana expands Medicaid, an estimated 298,000 to 427,000 additional adults will enroll in the program by 2019. The incoming governor, Mike Pence, said in the campaign he’d support expanding Medicaid only if the state could limit benefits and charge higher premiums to recipients. “Medicaid expansion feels like the classic gift of a baby elephant,” he said at a meeting of Republican governors last month. “And the federal government says, ‘We’ll pay for all the hay - for the first few years.’” ",12202012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-equality-indiana-welfarereform/the-unequal-state-of-america-indianas-rocky-road-to-welfare-reform-idUSBRE8BJ0J620121220

317,IBM,U.S. charges analyst in IBM insider trading case,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. authorities on Wednesday announced charges against a research analyst for trading and tipping others ahead of a 2009 acquisition by computer giant IBM, expanding a related insider trading case filed last month. Federal prosecutors charged Trent Martin, who worked at a Connecticut brokerage firm, for purchasing shares of SPSS before IBM agreed to the $1.2 billion deal. He was also charged with passing the information to others, including his roommate. On November 29 the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission charged two former stockbrokers, including Martin’s roommate, for their roles in the alleged insider trading scheme. The three and others made more than $1 million by trading ahead of the acquisition, prosecutors said. Martin was specifically named as the source of the information in instant messages between the two brokers, Thomas Conradt and David Weishaus, authorities said. In a July 2009 message, referring to Martin by name, Conradt wrote: “holy f*** . . . god trent told me not to tell anyone . . . big mistake,” according to the indictment unsealed on Wednesday. Weishaus responded, “eh, we’ll get rich.” Martin, an Australian citizen, was arrested on December 22 in Hong Kong, the Justice Department said. Martin could not immediately be reached for comment. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which filed related civil charges against Martin on Wednesday, said he fled the United States to Australia soon after learning about the SEC’s investigation.

319,IBM,In-store shoppers likely to head online next time they buy: IBM,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The overwhelming majority of shoppers made their last purchase in a store and not online, but far fewer are committed to do so the next time they buy something, according to a study released on Tuesday. More than 80 percent of shoppers in the study from International Business Machines Corp last bought something at a store, but only half said they would go to a brick-and-mortar retailer next time. The study showed both the importance and global reach of “showrooming,” in which shoppers examine products in stores and then make their purchase online. In China, 26 percent admitted to showrooming, compared with 13 percent in India and 7 percent in the United States, IBM said. The study is the latest to underscore the importance of online and mobile shopping. Thirty-five percent of the store shoppers surveyed around the world in November said that they were unsure whether they would shop at a store or online for their next purchase, according to IBM. Nine percent said that they would make their next purchase online. Retailers that do not embrace the small but growing group of showroomers risk losing those shoppers to Amazon.com Inc and other online-only competitors that often offer merchandise at lower prices. “Where do you want to place your bets for the future?” Jill Puleri, the global retail leader for IBM Business Services, asked executives at the National Retail Federation conference in New York this week. Nearly half of all online purchases resulted from showrooming, which is popular with younger shoppers - typically males - who tend to be more affluent than average, Puleri said. “This is not the enemy, far from it,” she said. “They are your best friends, your advocates.” While in-store transactions still make up the vast majority of sales, online purchases are increasing at a faster clip than those in stores. Some retail leaders say chains are not quick enough to adapt to this trend. J. Crew Chief Executive Officer Mickey Drexler scolded a panel at a Financo event on Monday for retail CEOs and other business leaders for not addressing the threat of Amazon during a discussion about how essential stores are for branding. “How do you have a panel like this without mentioning Amazon?” Drexler asked the group, which included Coach Inc CEO Lew Frankfort and VF Corp CEO Eric Wiseman. Of eight categories tracked in the IBM survey of 26,000 shoppers, the two most popular for online purchases were consumer electronics and luxury items, including jewelry and designer clothing. Nearly 25 percent of Internet shoppers had intended to buy in the store but ultimately purchased online, primarily for price and convenience, IBM said.

321,IBM,UPDATE 2-IBM's 2013 outlook raises hopes for more tech spending,"* Q4 revenue of $29.3 bln vs Street view $29.05 bln * Q4 EPS was $5.39 vs $5.25, sees 2013 EPS of at least $16.70 * Shares up more than 4 percent   (Recasts; adds more analyst comments, stock price, byline) By Nicola Leske Jan 22 (Reuters) - IBM, the world’s largest technology services company, promised better than expected full-year growth after its fourth-quarter results beat estimates, a sign that fears of corporate delays in technology spending may have been overblown. Companies had been widely expected to hold back on IT purchases in December in part because of worries about the so-called U.S. fiscal cliff. Automatic tax hikes and spending cuts would have been triggered had Congress not arrived at a deal to avert the cliff, and could have pushed the weak U.S. economy into recession. International Business Machines Corp said on Tuesday that it plans to achieve earnings of at least $16.70 a share for the full year, above analysts’ consensus forecast of $16.57. Its quarterly net income rose 10 percent to $6.1 billion, or $5.39 a share from $4.71 a year earlier. Revenue dropped 1 percent to $29.3 billion. Analysts had expected the Armonk, New York-based company to report net income of $5.95 billion, or $5.25 a share, on revenue of $29.05 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue in Brazil, India, Russia and China increased by 7 percent in 2012, or 12 percent adjusted for currency fluctuations. It grew 11 percent in the fourth quarter. Some analysts said IBM’s results were a sign that tech spending was improving. “It is better than what people had feared,” said Brian Marshall, an analyst at ISI Group. “Virtually every segment did a little bit better than people expected. It supports the fact that things are getting better out there at least from a tech industry standpoint.” Andrew Bartels, an analyst with research firm Forrester Research, said “we were expecting a lot of companies were sitting on their wallets until it became clear what was going to become of the fiscal cliff.” “Given the fact it’s Q4 with a cloud of the fiscal cliff, it’s a positive indication that tech software will be doing better in the next couple of months,” he added. But Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu said the success appeared to be more specific to IBM than the industry in general. “The results show that the IBM advantage and business model - vertical integration of hardware and software - is difficult to replicate,” he said. IBM has shifted its focus to higher-margin software and services from tech products over the past decade. “IBM has been doing this the longest and customers are very accustomed to it. They have a much stronger offering and brand name.” IBM shares rose more than 4 percent to $204.36 after closing at $196.08 on the New York Stock Exchange.

But Apple, still the largest U.S. publicly traded company, fell 8 percent in extended trading after sales of its flagship iPhone came in below analyst targets and quarterly revenue slightly missed Wall Street expectations. “One thing that stands out is the company’s ballooning balance sheet, where they now have $137 billion dollars in cash and investments,” said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at RDM Financial in Westport, Connecticut. “You’ve got to wonder when they’re going to put some more of that to work.” Declining issues beat advancers in both the NYSE and Nasdaq during regular market hours, in a sign the market’s rally may be overstretched. The broad Russell 2000 index closed the day down 0.3 percent after earlier hitting and intraday historic high just below 900 points. Shares in IBM Corp, the world’s largest technology services company, climbed 4.4 percent during regular market hours to $204.72, providing just about all of the Dow’s 67-point gain. Also helping the tech sector was a 5.5 percent jump in Google Inc to $741.50. The Internet search company reported its core business outpaced expectations and revenue was higher than expected.

The benchmark S&P; 500 is a mere 0.35 percent away from hitting 1,500, a level not seen since Dec. 12, 2007. S&P; 500 futures fell 4.1 points, or 0.3 percent, while Nasdaq 100 futures fell 20 points or 0.7 percent. Netflix shares soared 32 percent, above $136, after the video subscription service said it added subscribers in the United States and abroad and posted a quarterly profit. LED maker Cree Inc jumped 22 percent to $40.85 after it forecast a higher-than-expected third-quarter profit, and reported results above analysts’ estimates. Upscale leather goods maker Coach Inc plunged 16.4 percent to $50.75 after reporting sales that missed expectations. Clearing a market hurdle, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a Republican-led plan to extend the country’s borrowing authority until mid May. This delays a confrontation in Congress similar to one in 2011, which generated a stalemate that triggered the first-ever U.S. debt rating downgrade.

330,IBM,"IBM's shines with fourth quarter, 2013 outlook","(Reuters) - IBM, the world’s largest technology services company, gave a better than expected 2013 outlook after a solid fourth quarter that analysts say has more to do with Big Blue’s smooth execution than a vibrant tech spending environment. Companies had been widely expected to hold back on IT purchases in December in part because of worries about the so-called U.S. fiscal cliff. Automatic tax increases and spending cuts would have been triggered had Congress not made a deal to avert the cliff and could have pushed the weak U.S. economy into recession. But International Business Machines Corp said on Tuesday that its quarterly results beat forecasts and it plans to achieve earnings of at least $16.70 a share for the full year, above analysts’ consensus forecast of $16.57. While some analysts said IBM’s earnings may be a sign of an improved tech spending environment, others said the strong results were specific to IBM’s business model. “IBM is better positioned in a tough environment than most tech companies are,” said Cindy Shaw, managing director at Discern. IBM made a bold strategic move a decade ago when it bought PriceWaterhouse’s consulting business and then decided to exit the PC business, betting its future was in finding solutions to business problems with the help of software and technology. That strategy appears to have paid off. “What IBM does better than anyone, with the exception of Accenture, is solving problems and I am not talking about taking out some costs, but really driving revenue,” Shaw said. In addition, she said, IBM was strong in “hot growth markets” such as data analytics, cloud computing, emerging markets and what IBM calls smarter planet, which aims to improve areas such as traffic, power grids and food production. Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu agreed, saying the success appeared to be more specific to IBM than the industry in general. “The results show that the IBM advantage and business model - vertical integration of hardware and software - is difficult to replicate,” he said. “IBM has been doing this the longest and customers are very accustomed to it. They have a much stronger offering and brand name.” As a result quarterly net income rose 10 percent to $6.1 billion, or $5.39 a share from $4.71 a year earlier. Revenue dropped 1 percent to $29.3 billion due to the sale of its retail business in the third quarter. Analysts had expected the Armonk, New York-based company to report net income of $5.95 billion, or $5.25 a share, on revenue of $29.05 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue grew in particular because of an 11 percent increase in IBM’s growth markets in Brazil, India, Russia and China. Software revenue was up 3 percent in the quarter. Some analysts said IBM’s better than expected results were a sign that tech spending might not have been as bleak as expected. “It is better than what people had feared,” said Brian Marshall, an analyst at ISI Group. “Virtually every segment did a little bit better than people expected. It supports the fact that things are getting better out there at least from a tech industry standpoint.” Andrew Bartels, an analyst with research firm Forrester Research, said: “We were expecting a lot of companies were sitting on their wallets until it became clear what was going to become of the fiscal cliff. “Given the fact it’s Q4 with a cloud of the fiscal cliff, it’s a positive indication that tech software will be doing better in the next couple of months.” IBM shares rose more than 4 percent to $204.50 after closing at $196.08 on the New York Stock Exchange.

332,IBM,Judge limits data request to IBM in review of SEC settlement,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A judge on Monday narrowed his request for information from IBM as he decides whether to approve a 2011 settlement between the company and regulators over charges of foreign bribery. U.S. District Judge Richard Leon, seeking to keep close watch on potential misconduct at the company, has refused to sign off on International Business Machines Corp’s settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. He scolded IBM for a “history” of violating provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and “major payments” to foreign governments. Leon is the latest federal judge to express unhappiness with U.S. regulators’ handling of settlements with corporations during the past two years. IBM agreed in March 2011 to pay around $10 million to resolve SEC charges over improper gifts to government officials in South Korea and China. IBM neither admitted nor denied the allegations, a common feature in SEC settlements. Leon has resisted approving the deal and requested IBM to turn over a greater range of information about possible misconduct than both IBM and the SEC had originally agreed to. On Monday Leon said he was prepared to narrow his request to matters that could prove to be reasonably likely violations of the anti-bribery law, or those that could show the company’s books and records to be fraudulent, rather than all potential accounting violations. Fraudulent records could be a sign of a broader problem at the company, Leon said. The law bars payments to officials of foreign governments in exchange for business and also requires companies to maintain accurate books. “It’s important, corporate America is watching,” Leon said. In a feisty exchange, Leon told IBM lawyers they were “overthinking” his requests. Leon told the company and regulators he would not budge on his request for IBM to report any open investigations by federal government agencies into the company. Lawyers for IBM resisted, saying they feared such information could be made public if filed in court. In the past year numerous federal judges have repeatedly asked whether U.S. regulators were aggressive enough in responding to corporate misconduct. In November 2011 New York federal judge Jed Rakoff rejected a proposed accord between the SEC and Citigroup and said it was neither fair nor in the public interest. An appeals court is scheduled to hear arguments on the issue later this week.

334,IBM,IBM joins few issuers to price floating-rate note inside Libor,"Feb 5 (IFR) - IBM Corp on Tuesday made the most of a surge in demand for floating-rate notes in the corporate bond market by issuing a $1 billion two-year deal at a negative spread to Libor. The deal, which was part of a $2 billion offering of two-year floaters and five-year fixed-rate notes, was priced at three-month Libor minus 2 basis points, making it one of the very few corporates to have issued a floater inside of Libor since the credit crisis. The aggressive pricing was possible because of a scramble for floating-rate debt securities in the corporate bond market in recent weeks as Treasury yields rise. So far this year more than $14 billion of floating-rate notes have been priced, already equal to almost a third of the $42 billion of floaters issued in all of 2012. “We have seen a resurgence of demand for floating-rate product in 2013,” said Anne Daley, managing director and senior syndicate banker at Barclays in New York. “While supply has not been massive yet, the fact that we have already seen more than $14 billion year-to-date versus $42 billion for all of last year clearly shows there is very strong demand growing for the product.” Corporates have also been more willing to issue floating-rate notes, to balance out a debt mix which has been dominated by fixed-rate bond issuance in recent years as issuers sought to lock in record low fixed-rate coupons. Usually money managers and securities lenders tend to buy floaters inside of 18 months, but the strength of demand has enabled names like IBM and General Mills to issue out to two and three years respectively. JP Morgan was able to raise $2.4 billion of five year floaters in January. IBM is only the third industrial issuer since the crisis to print at a negative spread to Libor, along with Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola Company, which did deals last year.",2052013,http://www.reuters.com/article/ibm-bonds/ibm-joins-few-issuers-to-price-floating-rate-note-inside-libor-idUSL1N0B5LF520130205

337,IBM,Doctors seek help on cancer treatment from IBM supercomputer,"(Reuters) - IBM’s Watson supercomputer has beaten expert “Jeopardy” quiz show contestants, and its predecessor defeated a world chess champion. Now, doctors hope it can help them outsmart cancer. Oncologists at two medical groups have started to test IBM’s Watson’s supercomputer system in an effort to improve speed and efficacy of treatments, the company said on Friday. The Maine Center for Cancer Medicine and Westmed Medical Group will begin testing an application based on Watson’s cognitive computing to help diagnose lung cancer and recommend treatment, IBM said. “Access to comprehensive care can be difficult in rural areas such as southern Maine,” said Tracey Weisberg, medical oncology president at Maine Center for Cancer Medicine and Blood Disorders. “This allows the most comprehensive evidence based treatment we could have only dreamed of in the past,” she added. Watson is an artificial intelligence super computer system named after legendary International Business Machines President Thomas Watson. Thanks to its computing power Watson can sift through 1.5 million patient records and histories to provide treatment options in a matter of seconds based on previous treatment outcomes and patient histories. It has been fed with more than 600,000 pieces of medical evidence, 2 million pages of text from 42 medical journals and clinical trials in the area of oncology research, IBM said. In addition, IBM partnered with clinicians and technology experts from health insurer WellPoint and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center who spent thousands of hours to teach Watson how to process, analyze and interpret the meaning of complex clinical information, IBM said. “Every doctor knows they cannot keep up with hundreds of new articles but every physician wants to be right and this is a way of facilitating that,” said Samuel Nussbaum, chief medical officer at WellPoint. IBM first showcased Watson’s powers almost two years ago. The computer beat two human competitors on the popular U.S. quiz show “Jeopardy!” highlighting the progress people have made in making machines able to think like them. IBM has since further advanced Watson’s linguistic and analytical abilities to develop new products such as medical diagnosis.

339,IBM,IBM and AT&T; add to floating-rate note frenzy,"Feb 8 (IFR) - IBM and AT&T; made the most of a surge in demand for floating-rate notes in the US corporate bond market this week by issuing US$2.25bn of two-year and three-year floaters, and in IBM’s case at a negative spread to Libor. IBM issued US$1bn of two-year notes at three-month Libor minus 2basis points, making it one of the very few corporates to have issued a floater inside of Libor since the credit crisis. AT&T;, meanwhile, issued US$1.25bn of three-year floaters at 38.5bp over three-month Libor, at the tightest end of guidance, after attracting US$2bn of orders. The aggressive pricing on both was possible because of a scramble for floating-rate debt securities in the corporate bond market in recent weeks as Treasury yields rise. So far this year, more than US$16bn of FRNs have been priced, already more than a third of the US$42bn of floaters issued in all of 2012. Floating-rate tranches from the likes of AT&T; and IBM  are rarities, with both having abstained from public floater issuance since 2007. Although just 10.95% of overall year to-date issuance, the amount of floating-rate deals is expected to ramp up considerably if US economic data continue to be on the positive side. “We have seen a resurgence of demand for floating-rate product in 2013,” said Anne Daley, managing director and senior syndicate banker at Barclays in New York. “While supply has not been massive yet, the fact that we have already seen more than US$14bn year to-date versus US$42bn for all of last year clearly shows there is very strong demand growing for the product.” The last big surge of floating-rate demand was in January 2011, when the market was convinced that the only way for rates to go was up. Then issuance accounted for 23.58% of total deal volume and stayed above 20% of the total through to April of that year. Corporates are keen to add more floating-rate debt to their funding mix, which has become overweighted with fixed-rate notes in the past few years as they jumped to lock in all-time low yields. Their need to balance out their funding mix has been much welcomed by investors. “Demand for floaters has increased because the risk tolerance of traditional front-end buyers has grown in the last 12 months, coupled with a greater number of traditional long-dated investors viewing floaters as a hedge against a rise in interest rates at some point,” said Dan Mead, a managing director on Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s investment-grade corporate bond syndicate desk. Usually, money managers and securities lenders tend to buy floaters inside of 18 months, but the strength of demand has enabled names such as IBM and General Mills to issue out to two and three-year deals, respectively, and JP Morgan was able to raise US$2.4bn of five-year floaters in January. IBM is only the third industrial issuer since the crisis to print at a negative spread to Libor, along with Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola Company, which did deals last year. The IBM deal, led by Barclays, HSBC, Mizuho and RBC, was part of a US$2bn two-part trade that also included a US$1bn five-year fixed-rate portion. The floating-rate tranche attracted US$1.25bn of unpadded orders. The AT&T; floater, led by BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse and UBS, was part of a US$2.25bn trade that also included a US$1bn 0.90% three-year fixed-rate portion priced at 55bp over Treasuries.

340,IBM,IBM launches enhanced mobile services offering,"(Reuters) - International Business Machines unveiled its expanded mobile strategy on Thursday in an effort to gain an advantage over rivals amid a proliferation of devices such as smartphones and tablets. The technology services company will offer customers a portfolio of products for security, device management as well as analytics and application development, the company said. Using what IBM calls MobileFirst, “businesses can now streamline everything from the management of employee’s mobile devices, to the creation of a new mobile commerce app”, the company said. Lopez Research analyst Maribel Lopez said any company who wanted to succeed in the future needed to be strong in mobile. “This is critical for IBM because the future of computing is based on a couple of technologies: cloud, mobile and big data,” she said. “If IBM can actually educate the market that it has a pretty comprehensive (mobile) suite, that positions them really well,” she said. Currently, only German business software maker SAP was closest in offering a comparable comprehensive mobile strategy, Lopez added. IBM has made 10 acquisitions since 2006 to boost its mobile offering, most recently TeaLeaf and Worklight. TeaLeaf is a provider of mobile analytics and Worklight is maker of development and management software for tablets and smartphones.

Dallas, Texas-based SoftLayer has hired Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse to run the sale process, the sources said, asking not to be named because the talks are private. The IT infrastructure specialist, founded in 2005, has become the world’s largest privately held website hosting service. The company provides its 25,000 customers with cloud infrastructure mainly for small and medium-sized businesses. SoftLayer’s sale process was initially spurred by one of its customers, AT&T; Inc, which approached the company in recent months seeking exclusive talks, one of the sources said. AT&T; is no longer involved in the process, two of the sources said. Spokespeople for SoftLayer, AT&T;, EMC, IBM, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse declined to comment. Over the last few years, web hosting companies, including Rackspace Hosting Inc, have been considered attractive takeover candidates as technology and telecom companies look to improve the performance and cost efficiencies of their enterprise cloud computing services. In 2011, CenturyLink Inc bought managed hosting and colocation provider Savvis Inc for $2.5 billion. Also that year Verizon Communications Inc spent $1.4 billion to buy IT services provider Terremark Worldwide. EMC has been pushing ahead with its cloud-based software business, announcing a new venture on Wednesday with VMware Inc called Pivotal Inc, which will combine both companies’ data analytics and cloud application assets. EMC and VMware are hoping that the new Pivotal will cash in on an expected jump in demand for data analytics software as companies like telecom service providers want better tools to analyze masses of data from multiple different technology platforms [ID:nL1N0C53CS]. With 100,000 servers under management, SoftLayer counts VMware competitor Citrix Systems Inc as one of its customers, making it even more attractive to the current suite of buyers, the sources said. SoftLayer is majority held by GI Partners, which purchased all of the equity in partnership with SoftLayer management in August of 2010. In November of that year GI Partners merged The Planet, SoftLayers’s biggest competitor, with SoftLayer. GI Partners had a controlling interest in hosting company The Planet, where current SoftLayer CEO Lance Crosby served as chief operations officer for five years. Last year, SoftLayer appointed former Leap Wireless International Inc executive Walter Berger as its chief financial officer.

349,IBM,UPDATE 1-Former U.S. broker pleads guilty to insider trading,"* Pleads guilty to trading ahead of IBM deal * Faces up to 45 years in prison By Bernard Vaughan NEW YORK, April 3 (Reuters) - Former broker Thomas Conradt pleaded guilty Wednesday to insider trading charges related to trades he made ahead of a $1.2 billion acquisition by International Business Machines Corp in 2009. In court on Wednesday, Condradt, 35, said he used tips from a roommate to trade on shares of Chicago-based software company SPSS before IBM agreed to buy it on July 28, 2009, for $1.2 billion. He also passed those tips along to several colleagues at the Manhattan office of Euro Pacific Capital Inc, the brokerage he was working at. Conradt pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and two counts of securities fraud. He faces up to 45 years in prison, U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter said at the hearing. “I am deeply apologetic ... for my actions,” Conradt said, reading from a written statement. “I can assure the court that I will never put myself in this position again.” Catherine Redlich, Conradt’s lawyer, declined to comment after the hearing. David Weishaus, a co-defendant in the case was also in court on Wednesday. Judge Carter adjourned his hearing until June 5 so that he and his lawyer could review evidence. Weishaus was also employed at Euro Pacific Capital, which is based in Westport, Connecticut, and he attended law school with Conradt in Baltimore, according to court papers. Conradt’s former roommate, equities analyst Trent Martin, also faces charges for buying shares of SPSS before the deal. Martin, an Australian citizen, was arrested in December in Hong Kong and has been returned to the United States, according to court papers. Martin learned of the pending IBM deal from a close friend, a citizen of New Zealand, according to court papers. Martin, Conradt, Weishaus and others made more than $1 million by trading on the information, prosecutors have said. Martin was specifically named as the source of the information in instant messages between Conradt and Weishaus, authorities have said. Responding to Weishaus, who said another person had bought shares, Martin wrote: “god trent told me not to tell anyone ... big mistake.” Weishaus responded, “eh, we’ll get rich,” according to the indictment of Martin, made public in December. At the hearing on Wednesday, Carter asked Conradt if he’d sought any mental health treatment. Conradt said he has dealt with anxiety and depression “on and off” for the past 10 or 15 years. Conradt continues to cooperate with investigators. Carter  initially suggested July 2 for his sentencing, but pushed it back to Oct. 3 at the request of prosecutors while they continue their investigation. The case is U.S. v.

351,IBM,"Cisco, IBM and others team up on new technology project","April 8 (Reuters) - Cisco Systems, IBM and Citrix have joined forces with other tech companies in a consortium to kickstart the corporate market for software-defined networking (SDN), aimed at making network management easier and cheaper. Other members of the development platform called OpenDaylight include Juniper Networks, VMware, Microsoft, Red Hat, Intel and Brocade  as well as privately held Big Switch Networks and Arista Networks. Each member will contribute technology such as code to the project in an effort to share the costs of basic research and development, and enable products from different vendors to work together, the companies said on Monday. However, vendors will still be able to customize their offerings to differentiate themselves from rivals. The SDN market is still considered nascent, but is expected to grow to $3.7 billion by 2016 from an estimated $360 million this year, according to research firm IDC. The first code from OpenDaylight is expected to be released in the third quarter of this year. “It will be interesting to see how it works in practice. There was some skepticism on our part on the networking industry getting together because they never got together before,” said Brad Casemore, a veteran networking analyst at IDC, in Toronto. SDN products let businesses reduce the amount of networking gear in data centers by replacing much of their function with software that is centralized in one or more servers. The technology has been in the spotlight ever since VMware bought SDN startup Nicira in August last year for $1.26 billion.

352,IBM,"IBM misses estimates, blames weak sales and weaker yen","(Reuters) - IBM Corp (IBM.N) posted a rare quarterly earnings miss as the technology services company struggled with the depreciation of the Japanese yen and a failure to close a number of major deals, especially in Europe and the United States. Much like Oracle Corp ORCL.O last month, IBM blamed a poor performance by its sales force for some of the shortfall. But analysts said it was not just one quarter - the company’s sales have been weakening consistently, dragging down results with or without the changes in the yen. “Their revenue has been declining for basically many quarters in a row. You can’t have revenue declines and consistently expect your earnings to beat. That is catching up with them,” said ISI Group analyst Brian Marshall. IBM is known for keeping a tight rein on costs and focusing on high-margin software, allowing it to generally exceed Wall Street expectations, even in a tough economic environment. But Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge blamed poor sales execution for the failed closing of a number of deals, as well as the Easter holiday at the end of March. Around $400 million worth of deals expected to close in the first quarter had been moved into the second, IBM said. On a conference call with analysts, Loughridge also said it was unclear whether the sequester - a series of automatic U.S. federal budget cuts - had an effect. “It’s hard to measure. I can tell you that our U.S. federal business was down 13 percent, which was certainly a drag on the U.S. performance,” he said. The yen was at least something of an issue in the quarter as well. The deterioration in the Japanese currency since mid-January reduced earnings by 7 cents per share, a spokesman said. Loughridge said IBM was “clearly not immune from changes in the global economy,” noting the weak yen and the difficulty IBM has had in hedging that currency. Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P; Dow Jones Indices, said recently that nearly two dozen top U.S. companies - including IBM - derive 10 percent or more of their sales in Japan. He expects those companies to quickly see the impact of the weakening currency. But analysts said the yen issue was not foremost for them among IBM’s other problems. “This is really a combination of several factors,” Macquarie Research analyst Brad Zelnick said. “At the end of the day it’s the environment and demand for the products (companies) have to offer. Execution is another word for ‘we’re facing some challenges here.’” IBM’s first quarter non-GAAP income rose 3 percent to $3.4 billion, or $3 per share, but missed analyst estimates of $3.05 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It was the first time it at least nine quarters that IBM missed estimates. Quarterly revenue dropped 5 percent to $23.4 billion, compared with estimates of $24.6 billion. Revenues fell 3 percent adjusted for currency. For the current quarter, IBM is anticipating a restructuring charge of almost $1 billion and EPS in a similar range to the first quarter. Analysts expected earnings of $3.95 per share in the second quarter. However, Loughridge expected EPS to improve in the second half of the year, allowing IBM to reach its full year target of at least $16.70 per share. IBM shares lost 3.4 percent from a closing price of $207.15 in extended trading following results. Forrester Research’s Andrew Bartels said the results showed IBM was somewhat impacted by the sequester, but that Microsoft’s results showed tech spending was not generally down. “What we’re getting from these two results are somewhat different perspectives on how the macroeconomic environment is impacting tech spending,” he added.

362,IBM,IBM earnings miss points to poor quarter in hardware sector: analysts,"(Reuters) - Atleast five brokerages cut their price targets on IBM Corp shares and warned its weak earnings suggested results would also be disappointing at other hardware technology companies such as EMC Corp, Dell Inc and HP Co. IBM’s shares fell 8 percent to a three-month low of $190.56 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. IBM posted on Thursday a rare quarterly earnings miss as a sliding yen hurt earnings from Japan and it failed to close a number of major deals, especially in Europe and the United States. The company had disappointing results in certain hardware segments, such as high-end Unix and storage, Stifel Nicolaus & Co analyst David Grossman wrote in a note. He cut his price target on the stock by a dollar to $240. However, hardware, with the exception of the mainframe business, is not core to the growth of the company, Grossman said. The services business, which accounted for 60 percent of the company’s revenue, is improving, he added. RBC analyst Amit Daryanani cut his price target on the stock to $200 from $215, but said given IBM’s healthy services backlog, large annuity revenue streams such as services contracts and software licenses, which make up more than 60 percent of the company’s profitability, IBM should generate “solid EPS momentum” in FY13. “The IBM miss is a decidedly negative read through for the entire IT hardware segment and we are incrementally more cautious on the sector; particularly those with a March quarter end,” Deutsche Bank analyst Chris Whitmore wrote in a note. He cut his price target on the stock to $225 from $240. JP Morgan analyst Mark Moskovitz named Net App Inc, Lexmark International Inc, Xerox Corp, Brocade Communications Systems Inc, Emulex Corp, QLogic Corp, Seagate Technology PLC and Western Digital Corp as the other hardware names at risk. EMC and Xerox are scheduled to report results next week, while Dell and HP will report in May. BMO Capital Markets analyst Keith Bachman said IBM will have to step up its software acquisitions to improve revenue performance and EPS growth.

363,IBM,US STOCKS-Wall St bounces back with all eyes on Boston,"* Boston in virtual lockdown, trading volume could fall * IBM shares down, Google up after results * McDonald’s profit up, shares off as U.S. sales drop * Dow off 0.3 pct, S&P; up 0.5 pct, Nasdaq up 0.9 pct By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, April 19 (Reuters) - Most U.S. stocks edged higher on Friday, bouncing back a day after the S&P; 500 index closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time this year, but a sharp drop in IBM shares kept the Dow in the red. Trading volume could see a decline as much of Boston, a major U.S. financial center and home to a number of the country’s biggest mutual fund companies, was under virtual lock-down after police killed one suspect in the Boston Marathon bombing in a shootout and mounted house-to-house searches for a second man. “Most major news networks are talking about what’s going on in Boston than anything else,” said Art Hogan, managing director at Lazard Capital, over the phone from Boston. “That tends to shift investor focus toward this than anything else in the market.” Hogan, who got to work early in the morning, described uncommonly empty streets and offices partially staffed as transportation is shut down in the city and parents stay home to take care of their kids, with schools shut down. “The city is very much a ghost town right now,” he said soon after the market opened. Meanwhile, on Wall Street, markets partially recovered from a 3 percent decline on the S&P; 500 over the previous four sessions, that set it on track to post its worst week since June. IBM Corp led declines in the Dow a day after it posted an earnings miss, while less-than-stellar numbers from General Electric and MacDonald’s Friday weighed further on the blue-chips. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 53.45 points or 0.37 percent, to 14,483.69, the S&P; 500 gained 5.99 points or 0.39 percent, to 1,547.6 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 26.63 points or 0.84 percent, to 3,192.99. The S&P; 500’s close below the 50-day moving average on Thursday indicates the medium-term uptrend in the market could be in peril. The last time the index closed consecutive days under its 50-day average came in early December. IBM posted quarterly earnings that missed estimates due to the depreciation of the Japanese yen and a failure to close major deals, especially in Europe and the United States. The stock was down 7.2 percent at $192.32. GE shares fell 3.9 percent to $21.78 after the conglomerate reported a quarterly profit in line with expectations as GE sold more jet engines and shed its stake in NBC Universal. McDonald’s fell 2 percent to $99.91 after it reported a first-quarter profit that fell short of Wall Street’s expectations and said sales at established U.S. restaurants fell 1.2 percent. Google’s core Internet business increased net revenue 23 percent in the first quarter, softening the effect of a sharp decline in its Motorola mobile phone division. Its shares were up 2.6 percent at $785.98. Vertex Pharmaceuticals said Thursday an experimental drug improved lung function in adults with cystic fibrosis in a midstage trial.

367,IBM,IBM CEO Rometty urges employees to act faster: WSJ,"(Reuters) - IBM Corp’s Chief Executive Virginia Rometty told employees the company had become too sluggish and unresponsive, after it posted weak first-quarter results, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing IBM’s internal video message addressed to its employees. The technology services company posted on Thursday a rare quarterly earnings miss as a sliding yen hurt earnings from Japan and it failed to close a number of major deals, especially in Europe and the United States. Rometty set a new rule. If a client has a request or question, IBM must respond within 24 hours, the newspaper reported she said in that call. She addressed the call to over 434,000 employees worldwide. “Where we haven’t transformed rapidly enough, we struggled,” Rometty said in the video published on IBM’s internal website, reviewed by the newspaper. “We have to step up with that and deal with that, and that is on all levels.” IBM was not immediately reachable for comment on the report. IBM blamed a poor performance by its sales force for some of the shortfall for the poor quarterly results. But analysts said it was not just one quarter - the company’s sales have been weakening consistently, dragging down results with or without the changes in the yen. Rometty said IBM needs to speed its shift to new computing models to get back on track, the Journal reported citing the video. (Wall Street Journal article: link.reuters.com/dah67t) IBM also reassigned one of its most senior executives, the head of its computer hardware business, following a sharp drop in first-quarter sales at the unit, the Journal reported citing a person familiar with the matter.

Mainland Chinese markets were tepid after the long holiday with Shanghai volume at its weakest in three weeks, with the property sector buoyed by a private survey that showed home prices rose for an eleventh-straight month.

The news and financial data company said on Friday that Palmisano will report to its board of directors and he will immediately undertake a review of current policies for client data and end-user information. Bloomberg said last week that its reporters had limited access to some data considered proprietary, including when a customer logs in or looks for information on assets such as equities or bonds. Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief Matthew Winkler apologized after a major client, Goldman Sachs Group , lodged complaints. Since then, other Bloomberg clients, including JPMorgan Chase & Co and government agencies across the globe, have said they were looking into the issue. The appointment of Palmisano comes after Bloomberg named a chief data compliance officer last week. “We want to go even further and get the benefit of independent leading experts so that we set the new standard for privacy and data security,” Daniel Doctoroff, Bloomberg’s CEO and president, said in a statement. Palmisano was IBM’s chief executive from 2002 until January 2012 and held the post of the company’s chairman from 2003 until last September. He serves on the boards of ExxonMobil, American Express and Bloomberg Philanthropies. Bloomberg said its board has also hired the law firm Hogan Lovells and the financial services consulting firm Promontory Financial Group to help Palmisano implement any recommendations. The company also asked Clark Hoyt, editor-at-large at Bloomberg News, to conduct a review of the newsroom’s relationship with the sales organization. Hoyt, who served as the New York Times’s public editor from 2007 until 2010, will report to Doctoroff. Privately held Bloomberg, which competes with Thomson Reuters Corp , gets the bulk of its revenue from terminal sales to financial institutions. The company has more than 315,000 terminal subscribers globally, with each Bloomberg terminal costing roughly $20,000 a year. Last year, it posted revenue of $7.9 billion.",5172013,http://www.reuters.com/article/bloomberg-data/bloomberg-appoints-former-ibm-chief-to-advise-on-data-issues-idUSL2N0DY19Z20130517
378,IBM,IBM to buy website hosting service SoftLayer,"(Reuters) - International Business Machines said on Tuesday it would acquire Web hosting company SoftLayer Technologies and create a new division for clients interested in so-called cloud services, a move to better compete with larger rivals in the space. Executives with IBM and SoftLayer declined to comment on the terms of the deal on a call with reporters. Reuters reported in March that IBM, among others, had been in talks to buy SoftLayer in a deal that could fetch more than $2 billion. Dallas-based SoftLayer, which leases online storage space to companies, was founded in 2005 and has become what it says is the world’s largest privately held website hosting service. The company provides its 25,000 customers, including AT&T; Inc and Citrix Systems Inc, with cloud infrastructure. The company competes with Amazon.com Inc’s Web services business and Rackspace Hosting Inc. Like rivals Hewlett Packard Co and Microsoft Corp, IBM has increasingly invested in cloud services as corporate users move away from costly internal information technology infrastructure. IBM has traditionally specialized in assisting large corporate and government users but has been trying in recent years to expand into smaller businesses. But Erich Clementi, senior vice president of IBM Global Technology Services, said on a call with reporters that IBM is shooting squarely for the large business segment with this acquisition. “We are the largest infrastructure provider to the enterprise world on the planet,” he said “That is our focus.” Over the last few years, Web hosting companies have been considered attractive takeover candidates as technology and telecom companies look to improve the performance and cost efficiencies of their cloud computing services for businesses. Wells Fargo analyst Gray Powell estimated that the transaction was worth 11.1 times SoftLayer’s projected 2013 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. That compares with Rackspace, which is currently trading at 11 times 2013 estimated EBITDA, Powell noted. IBM said it expected to gain $7 billion annually in revenue from cloud services by the end of 2015. It created a new division called Cloud Services, which will combine SoftLayer and IBM’s existing offerings into a global platform. SoftLayer is majority held by GI Partners, which purchased all of the equity in partnership with the company’s management in August 2010. Data storage equipment maker EMC had been approached about SoftLayer as well. An EMC spokesman said on Tuesday, “EMC was initially approached, uninterested and decided not to bid.” IBM said it expected the deal to close in the third quarter.

380,IBM,Fitch Affirms IBM's IDRs at 'A+/F1'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, June 19 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of  International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) as follows:  --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+'; --Senior unsecured revolving credit facility at 'A+'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A+';  --Short-term IDR at 'F1';  --Commercial paper (CP) rating at 'F1'. Furthermore, Fitch has withdrawn all ratings for IBM International Group Capital  LLC.  The Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch's action affects approximately $43 billion  of debt, including IBM's undrawn $10 billion credit facility. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings and Outlook reflect IBM's: --Strong company profile primarily supported by i) significant revenue market  share in information technology (IT) services (No.1), servers (No.1), enterprise  software (No.1) and external storage (No.3); ii) solid recurring revenue (50%)  from IT services, software and financing that mitigates revenue and profit  volatility; and iii) highly diversified revenue base by offering, customer,  industry and geography (65%+ revenue outside U.S.). --Exceptional financial flexibility due to i) robust internal liquidity with a  significant cash position ($12 billion) and free cash flow (FCF) exceeding $11  billion since 2008; ii) solid external liquidity with an undrawn $10 billion  revolving credit facility (RCF) due 2017 and ready access to capital markets;  iii) strong credit protection metrics; and iv) roughly $28 billion of finance  receivables (57% short-term and 60% considered investment grade).  --Well-executed management strategy, including i) ability to identify early  trends that present significant higher margin, long-term growth opportunities  and reposition investment priorities, both organic and inorganic, to capitalize  on these opportunities (i.e. analytics and growth markets); ii) consistent and  sizable investments in R&D; (6% of revenue) to develop innovative differentiated  solutions that leverage IBM's entire portfolio of offerings and command higher  profit margins (i.e. Smarter Planet); iii) core competency in identifying and  integrating strategic acquisitions; and iv) established track record of  consistently meeting or exceeding financial forecasts. Rating concerns center on: --Risk of core debt (non-financing) increases to achieve financial and/or  business objectives, such as sizable debt-financed share repurchases and/or  acquisitions, resulting in a material reduction of credit protection measures.  Fitch notes IBM has significant incremental debt capacity without adversely  affecting its current credit ratings.  --Consistent, material increases in cash dividends long-term, which could  pressure FCF and financial flexibility in the absence of commensurate growth in  profitability. This could necessitate further increases in core debt to fund  acquisitions and/or share repurchases. --IBM's increasing dependence on mainframe (System Z) refresh cycles to maintain  profitability in the Systems and Technology Group (STG) due to IBM's  underperforming storage business, weak industry demand for UNIX-based Power  servers as more and increasingly diverse workloads are performed on low-cost x86  industry standard servers (ISS), and negative revenue mix shift as ISS are  considerably less profitable than UNIX.  Declining demand for UNIX-based Power systems also adversely affects the  profitability of STG's microelectronics business, which designs and manufactures  the Power microprocessors used in Power servers. The decline in UNIX server  demand also carries negative longer-term revenue and margin ramifications for  IBM's support services and financing businesses relating to Power servers.  IBM's strategy to reverse the decline in Power server demand is to expand the  Power platform to address the open-source Linux market. IBM first introduced  PowerLinux solutions in April 2012 and currently offers three Power-based Linux  systems, including the PureFlex System, a pre-integrated offering of compute,  storage, networking, virtualization and management. As for ISS, Fitch believes  IBM lacks the scale and purchasing leverage to profitably compete against  Hewlett-Packard Company and Dell Inc. in this highly competitive market. --The long-term threat to highly profitable mainframe demand and associated  operating system software (zOS) from ISS.  KEY RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch believes the company's lack of a strategic rationale to maintain a higher  rating at the expense of financial flexibility required for acquisitions or  shareholder-friendly activities limits further positive rating actions. The ratings may be downgraded in the event of: --A shift to more aggressive financial policies.  IBM has strong financial flexibility and liquidity supported by nearly $12  billion of cash and equivalents as of March 31, 2013 and an undrawn $10 billion  RCF expiring on Nov. 10, 2017. Liquidity is further supported by strong and  consistent annual FCF (post-dividends) exceeding $11 billion since 2008.  Fitch expects IBM's FCF to exceed $11 billion in 2013. This is primarily due to  continued profit margin expansion, reflecting a more favorable revenue mix and  continued cost discipline, offset by substantial incremental cash taxes. Also a  factor is modest top-line growth led by Smarter Planet solutions, business  analytics, growth markets and cloud computing. Fitch expects IBM to continue to  use FCF for acquisitions, particularly in the software and services industries,  aggressive share repurchases and dividend payments to shareholders. The underfunded status of IBM's worldwide defined benefit (DB) pension plans  deteriorated to negative $14.4 billion (86% funded) at year-end 2012 from  negative $10.4 billion (89% funded) in 2011. This is primarily due to lower  discount rates in the U.S. and worldwide plans, which increased the present  value of IBM's future pension liability (U.S. discount rate declined 60 basis  points to 3.6%).  Excluding unfunded nonqualified DB pension plans, the funded status of IBM's  U.S. and worldwide plans at year-end 2012 was 98% and 94%, respectively. In  2013, IBM is required to make legally mandated contributions of $700 million to  its international DB plans. This compares with approximately $600 million  actually contributed in 2012. The amount of the 2013 pension contribution is  very manageable given the amount and consistency of IBM's cash flow. Fitch believes IBM has more than ample liquidity to satisfy its longer-term  legally mandated pension funding requirements (estimated at approximately $4  billion through 2017). This estimate could increase due to more frequent  re-measurement of funded status in certain non-U.S. countries and the  performance of financial markets.  Total debt was $33.4 billion as of March 31, 2013, and consisted of $8.7 billion  of short-term debt (including $1.8 billion of CP) and $24.7 billion of long-term  debt. Fitch estimates $25.2 billion (76%) of total debt is attributable to IBM's  global financing business with the remaining debt attributable to core  (non-financing) operations.  For the purpose of financial evaluation, Fitch analyzes IBM's core business and  financing activities separately, since they are capitalized differently and have  dissimilar cash flow characteristics. IBM Global Finance (IGF) accounted for  nearly 9% of IBM's pre-tax earnings in 2012. This, however, represents the  largest component of IBM's balance sheet, constituting approximately 23% of  total assets and 24% of total liabilities as of March 31, 2013.  IBM has $3.0 billion of long-term debt maturing in the remainder of 2013  followed by $3.8 billion of maturities in 2014. Fitch believes IBM will  refinance the vast majority of the upcoming debt maturities in order to maintain  a targeted debt/equity ratio of approximately 7x for the financing business and  maintain a permanent amount of core debt in the capital structure.  Total leverage and interest coverage as of March 31, 2013 were relatively  unchanged at 1.3x and 26.5x, respectively. Core leverage and interest coverage  remained flat at 0.3x and 55x, respectively.  The main purpose of IGF is to facilitate clients' acquisition of IBM systems,  software and services by providing financial and capital management solutions.  IGF has a solid long-term operating record, provides strategic advantages to IBM  in terms of attracting and retaining customers by delivering total solutions.  IBM also generates an annuity-like revenue stream associated with multi-year  leases.  IGF's primary focus on IBM's products and clients mitigates some risks  associated with financing via a deep knowledge of its client base and clear  insight into the solutions being financed. Asset quality metrics have remained  relatively solid as a result of the relatively conservative underwriting culture  and strong risk management capabilities. IGF's capitalization remains solid for  the rating category and leverage levels continue to hover near management's  target of 7x.   Contact: Primary Analyst John M.

382,IBM,Black clouds hang over Spain's small solar farms,"MADRID (Reuters) - After retiring from a long career at IBM, Spain’s Angel Miralda poured his savings into a small solar farm in the hilly northern region of Huesca, encouraged by government promises of stable returns. Now Miralda fears a new government energy policy will deepen cuts to renewable energy subsidies, wipe out his savings and push his business over the brink. Small-scale photovoltaic (PV) energy producers like Miralda started investing in solar panels when the government was offering lucrative subsidies under a decade-long drive to become a global leader in green energy. But a prolonged economic recession and a yawning budget gap forced Madrid to pull back its support for renewables, and more cuts are on the way, threatening major losses on personal investments and even defaults on bank loans. Banks financed 80 percent of a total 25 billion euros ($33.5 billion) invested in PV installations in Spain, according to industry association ANPIER, of which Miralda is one of about 4,300 members. While big companies also raced to develop wind and solar technologies, the vast majority of PV investments were by small-time savers. Miralda made a down-payment on a solar farm in Benabarre, Huesca, launched as a cooperative with eight other investors in 2008 when government-guaranteed returns on investments were more attractive than sovereign bond yields and an unpredictable stock market. His local bank put up 70 percent of the financing. “I decided to do it because it seemed like a safe, profitable investment backed by the government. I’d always been interested in energy, and I thought it was a good way to help our country’s economic development,” Miralda, 65, told Reuters. “I trusted the terms laid out in the 2007 law,” he said, referring to the royal decree that became a cornerstone for PV investments before successive changes to the law that have dented revenues by 40 percent. The royal decree guaranteed regulated revenues of 450 euros per megawatt hour, but with 3,861 MW of PV capacity in 2010 - 10 times the government’s goal - it started to limit entitlement to incentives. Now Miralda says revenue from his solar farm is not enough to cover payments on his loan, which is backed by his home, or the maintenance on his 500-kilowatt installation. Further cuts expected by mid-July could be critical. “The situation is delicate. If there’s another cut I don’t know what we’ll do,” Miralda said, echoing the concern of thousands of Spanish PV investors, many of them farmers. Unlike the large foreign funds that have initiated legal action against Spain for changing solar rules, under Spanish law domestic investors have no legal recourse because the changes were passed by executive decree. Instead they have launched an internet platform called Nuevo Modelo Energetico with the support of attorneys, renewable associations and political parties to protest their plight in Spain and Europe. “The government encouraged us to invest, and now they’re changing the rules in the middle of the game. In any other business, contracts have to be upheld, and in this case one of the parties is our own government,” Miralda said. Spanish Industry Minister Jose Manuel Soria has argued he had no choice but to put a cap on incentives that led to an uncontrolled PV bubble. Other European countries are also struggling to reconcile years of heavily subsidized growth in renewable energy with current overcapacity and tight finances. But some, like Germany, have considered scaling back future incentives rather than changing the terms for existing projects. Years of government support for renewables are largely to blame for a current 26 billion euro deficit in Spain’s power system that the European Union has called on the country to erase as it struggles to keep public finances under control. Soria must cut 4 billion euros from annual power system costs to keep the tariff debt from growing, but recently said he would spread the pain across sectors and wanted to ensure “reasonable returns” on investments by linking subsidies to sovereign borrowing costs. Spain’s large utilities also invested heavily in renewable energy projects and face a hit to earnings from a fresh round of cuts due by the middle of July. But the pain for small investors will be felt closer to home. “We have to pay back those loans no matter what, even if it means selling our land,” said Ramon Salvia, a 46-year-old agricultural technician who stretched his savings to join 11 other partners in a 5 million-euro, 600 kw solar farm in Linyola, northeast Spain. “It’s a question of pride,” Salvia said.

384,IBM,"IBM raises '13 outlook; second-quarter earnings beat, revenue drops","(Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) raised its full-year outlook on Wednesday based on cost cutting and a strong software pipeline. International Business Machine Corp beat second-quarter earnings estimates thanks to growth in its mainframe and software units, but missed on revenue. “In the first half, we’ve had strength in Latin America and the Middle East and Africa region, but declines in some of our larger markets like China and Australia have impacted the overall performance,” Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on a call with analysts. “As we look at the second half,” he said, “we have some very, very distinct tailwinds.” He added IBM had the best services backlog growth in four years and a very strong software pipeline going into the second half. The company’s shares, which had been up after-hours nearly 3 percent, gave about half of that back to end all of Wednesday’s New York trade up 1.25 percent at $197.01. IBM said that excluding a $1 billion restructuring charge related to job cuts, it raised its non-GAAP earnings per share expectations for this year by 20 cents to at least $16.90. The cuts were taken mainly outside of the United States, a spokesman said, adding about 60 percent were from IBM’s services division and 20 percent each from its hardware and software segments. IBM also said that a “substantial second-half gain” it was expecting from a divestiture in its previous EPS outlook “will not likely be achieved” by the end of 2013. Loughridge did not give details apart from saying that the company was still in active discussions and that it would not sell too low or rush into a sale. Nevertheless, he said, “fundamentally, whether we close a large divestiture this year or not, we’ll not have any effect on our ability to achieve our 2015 objective of at least $20 per share on an all-in basis”. Earlier in the year news of talks between IBM and Lenovo over the sale of IBM’s System X server business surfaced but were not confirmed by the companies. Brian Marshall, an analyst at ISI Group, said the sale “is perhaps the last significant opportunity to optimize gross margins of the IBM product portfolio”. He estimated it could fetch $2 billion to $3 billion in a sale. Total operating non-GAAP gross profit margin was 49.7 percent in the 2013 second quarter compared with 48.2 percent a year earlier. The Armonk, N.Y.-based company said its quarterly non-GAAP income rose 3 percent, excluding a $1 billion restructuring charge, to $4.3 billion, or $3.91 a share, compared with $3.51 a year ago and analyst estimates of $3.77 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share were $2.91, down 13 percent; net income was $3.2 billion, down 17 percent. Revenue dropped 3 percent to $24.9 billion below average analyst expectations of $25.4 billion. Adjusted for currency, software revenue was up 5 percent and its mainframe revenue rose 11 percent in the quarter. Currency negatively impacted overall revenue growth by about $500 million. Loughridge said he expected a continued negative impact from currency through the year. Several brokerages had cut their price targets for IBM in the past weeks on concerns over revenue growth and recent weaker performance by competitors Oracle (ORCL.N) and Accenture (ACN.N). Analysts said the results were better than expected, especially after IBM posted a rare miss in its first quarter. “After a first half that showed muted demand at best, you have a 20 cent raise excluding the workforce rebalancing, what is implied you are going to have strength in the higher margin software and services,” said Edward Jones tech analyst Josh Olson. Andrew Bartels, an analyst at Forrester Research, said IBM’s strength in software demonstrated that its “strategic shift to focus on software is paying dividends”. “For the broader tech market perspective, software overall will continue to be one of the strongest tech segments in 2013,” he added.

386,IBM,US STOCKS-Wall St gets a lift from Bernanke's flexible Fed view,"* Yahoo’s stock jumps to highest intraday level since May 2008 * Bank of America shares climb after earnings * American Express shares extend drop after the bell on results * Intel and eBay shares slip, but IBM up in after-hours trading * Dow up 0.1 pct, S&P; 500 up 0.3 pct, Nasdaq up 0.3 pct By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended modestly higher on Wednesday after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the timeline for winding down the U.S. central bank’s stimulus program was not set in stone. Shares of Bank of America and Yahoo rose after the companies reported quarterly results. Both ranked among the names giving the biggest boost to the S&P; 500. The three major U.S. stock indexes bounced back from Tuesday’s lower close, which broke the S&P; 500’s eight-day string of gains. Bernanke said the U.S. central bank still expects to start scaling back its massive bond-buying program later this year, but he said the timeline depended on the economic outlook.  He made the comments on Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee as part of his twice-yearly report to Congress on monetary policy. On Thursday, he will appear before the Senate Banking Committee. “He’s still being quite vague in describing exactly what to expect next, and I think that serves his purposes. He’s trying to minimize the impact of policy change on the markets,” said Lawrence Creatura, portfolio manager at Federated Investors in Rochester, New York. Bernanke’s comments on May 22 triggered a drop of nearly 6 percent in the S&P; 500 in the month that followed. But remarks from Bernanke and other Fed officials since then have calmed the market and erased those declines. The S&P; 500 is just several points away from the all-time intraday high of 1,687.18 it reached on May 22. For the year, the S&P; 500 is up 17.9 percent. Yahoo shares shot up 10.3 percent to close at $29.66. Earlier, Yahoo hit an intraday high at $29.73, its highest level since May 2008. Instead of Yahoo’s bottom-line results, investors focused more on news of its stake in the fast-growing Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba and its product development efforts. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 18.67 points, or 0.12 percent, to end at 15,470.52. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 4.65 points, or 0.28 percent, to finish at 1,680.91. The Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 11.50 points, or 0.32 percent, to close at 3,610.00. Bank of America shares gained 2.8 percent to $14.31, while BNY Mellon Corp shares rose 1.9 percent at $30.92. Both led the financial sector higher after the banks reported stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings.   The S&P; financial sector index  advanced 0.5 percent. “One reason investors might be encouraged by earnings is that management teams have done a great job of setting expectations, and right now, the bar is set at ankle height,” Creatura said. “So it should be reasonably easy for companies to beat expectations this quarter, and that could be a positive catalyst for markets.” Analysts expect S&P; 500 companies’ second-quarter earnings to have grown 3.3 percent from a year earlier, with revenue up 1.2 percent, Thomson Reuters data showed. On the flip side, shares of American Express fell 1.9 percent to $76.80 after the European Commission said it would propose limits on fees that banks can charge to process debit-card and credit-card transactions. During the regular session, American Express was the Dow’s biggest percentage decliner. After the bell, American Express shares slid 1 percent to $76 after the company reported results. In other trading after the bell, shares of Intel  fell 3.3 percent to $23.35 after the world’s biggest chipmaker cut its full-year revenue forecast and said it is scaling back capital spending. Shares of eBay dropped 6.2 percent to $53.80 in extended-hours trading after the e-commerce company reported solid second-quarter results, but warned of “headwinds” in the second half of the year from Europe and Korea. In contrast, shares of IBM rose almost 3 percent in extended-hours trading after IBM raised its full-year earnings forecast and reported second-quarterly earnings that beat estimates. During the regular session, IBM’s stock rose 0.4 percent to end at $194.55. During the regular session, shares of DuPont jumped 5.3 percent to $57.25 after Trian Fund Management’s Nelson Peltz said he has amassed a “big stake” in the chemicals maker. The stock was the Dow’s top percentage gainer. Part of the day’s upbeat tone came from the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, which said the U.S. economy continued to grow at a modest to moderate pace in June and early July, with manufacturing expanding in most areas of the country. Volume was roughly 5.7 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and the NYSE MKT, below the average daily closing volume of about 6.4 billion this year. On Monday, volume hit its lowest for any full trading day this year. Advancers outpaced decliners on the NYSE by a ratio of nearly 2 to 1 in Wednesday’s session. On the Nasdaq, about three stocks rose for every two that fell.

388,IBM,Amazon vs IBM: Big Blue meets match in battle for the cloud,"SAN FRANCISCO, July 21 (Reuters) - The tech industry maxim that “no one ever got fired for buying IBM” is a testament to how Big Blue has been the gold standard in computing services for decades. But IBM faces an unlikely challenger in Amazon.com Inc , the e-commerce retail giant that is becoming a force in the booming business of cloud computing, even winning backing from America’s top spy agency. After years of being dismissed as a supplier of online computer services to startups and small businesses, Amazon Web Services (AWS) beat out International Business Machines  this year to snag a $600 million contract with the Central Intelligence Agency. IBM has successfully appealed its loss in the contest, stalling it for now. But the episode highlights how Amazon is evolving from an online retailer into a competitive provider of information technology and services to big companies, and government bodies. That has helped push Amazon shares to a new record ahead of the company’s second-quarter results due on Thursday. Amazon doesn’t break out AWS results, but Wall Street believes it is expanding faster than the retail business and is more profitable. “AWS is one of the main spokes of the bull case on Amazon shares,” argues Ron Josey, an analyst at JMP Securities. “Software and IT investors are aware of and are trying to size AWS, and what the impact could be on their sector.” IBM is entrenched in corporations across the globe; and with one of the industry’s biggest research budgets, is likely to remain so for some time. But it and other players like Oracle  are taking note of AWS as cloud computing takes off. Public cloud computing, which AWS pioneered in 2006, lets companies rent computing power, storage and other services from data centers shared with other customers - typically cheaper and more flexible than maintaining their own. Amazon has begun to build a portfolio of significant clients, including Samsung, Pfizer, the Public Broadcasting Service and NASA, the U.S. space agency. That unexpected threat is rippling through the sector. After two quarters of falling sales, Oracle announced partnerships in June with former foes Microsoft and Salesforce.com , a response in part to AWS’s expansion. “AWS is having a really meaningful impact on IT and the big incumbent companies like IBM are reacting to that now,” said Colby Synesael, an analyst at Cowen & Co, who covers Rackspace Hosting, one of Amazon’s main rivals in the cloud. Amazon began life as an online bookseller, but in past years has expanded into everything from tablet computers to video. Critics say it is spending heavily with little regard for the bottom line. But its stock hit a record $309.39 on July 16 and is up more than 22 percent this year. In contrast, Oracle is down 4 percent in 2013. IBM, which reported a fifth straight quarterly sales fall on Wednesday, is up 1 percent. AWS slashed prices on one of its popular services, EC2, this month and Rackspace shares promptly slid, leaving them down more than 45 percent so far this year. AWS generates at least $2 billion a year in revenue now from a total pie of more than $60 billion, according to analysts who expect that to quintuple to more than $10 billion in coming years, partly driven by higher government cloud spending. The tussle with IBM over the CIA contract has helped burnish Amazon’s credentials, increasing Wall Street’s confidence in the ability of AWS to compete with the big boys of enterprise IT. Five companies vied for the contract - AWS, IBM, Microsoft, AT&T; and another unidentified firm, according to a report on the bidding by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. When AWS won, IBM protested, triggering the report by the GAO. The agency recommended in June that the CIA re-do some parts of its contract negotiations, giving IBM another chance. But the GAO also stated that AWS’s offering was superior. “In every technical criterion Amazon out-scored IBM, one of the most sophisticated and capable IT companies in the world,” said Carlos Kirjner, an analyst at Bernstein Research. The CIA had “grave” concerns, according to the GAO report, about IBM’s ability to provide “auto-scaling,” a feature that automatically adds or removes computing power in response to applications use. “Auto-scaling is very complex and there are not many cloud providers that can do it well, but Amazon is great at it,” said Kyle Hilgendorf, a cloud computing analyst at Gartner. “I don’t think anyone thinks IBM has a better cloud service.” IBM spokesman Clint Roswell said there were “inaccuracies” in the government’s assessment of its CIA proposal. “IBM remains committed to providing enterprise-level secure and robust cloud solutions and looks forward to a renewed opportunity to show our capabilities to fulfill the requirements of this important agency,” he added. An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment on the CIA contract. A CIA spokesman also declined to comment. IBM bought SoftLayer Technologies, a rival to AWS, for $2 billion in June. That could help it when the CIA comes calling again, said Bill Moran at Ptak Associates. “They do not need any other issue like ‘auto-scaling’ to bedevil them the next time around,” he added.",7212013,http://www.reuters.com/article/amazon-cloud/amazon-vs-ibm-big-blue-meets-match-in-battle-for-the-cloud-idUSL1N0FM24820130721
389,IBM,U.S. judge approves IBM's foreign bribery case settlement with SEC,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday signed off on IBM’s 2011 settlement with U.S. regulators over charges of foreign bribery, wrapping up the latest case that questioned U.S. authorities’ aggressiveness in investigating corporate misconduct. U.S. District Judge Richard Leon approved the settlement between International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) and the Securities and Exchange Commission after IBM agreed to a two-year reporting requirement on accounting fraud or bribery as well as federal investigations. IBM in March 2011 agreed to pay some $10 million to resolve SEC charges over improper gifts to government officials in South Korea and China. The Department of Justice is now investigating allegations of illegal activity by a former IBM employee in Poland as well as transactions in Argentina, Bangladesh an Ukraine, according to IBM’s April 30 filing with the SEC. Leon warned that if any IBM violations land on his desk in the future, he would be stricter in his review. “If there’s a problem in the next two years, obviously it won’t be a day like today, it won’t be a happy day,” Leon told IBM’s General Counsel Robert Weber at the court hearing. IBM neither admitted nor denied the allegations of bribery in South Korea or China, a common feature in SEC settlements. “When we receive an allegation of wrongdoing, we investigate it and take appropriate action,” IBM said in a statement on Thursday while also calling its compliance program “robust” and welcoming Leon’s ruling. In February, Leon scolded IBM for a “history” of violating provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and “major payments” to foreign governments, the latest federal judge to express concerns over U.S. regulators’ handling of settlements with corporations during the past two years. Numerous federal judges have recently asked whether U.S. regulators were aggressive enough in responding to corporate misconduct. The law bars payments to officials of foreign governments in exchange for business and also requires companies to maintain accurate books. Leon’s ruling on Thursday required IBM to annually report to the court and the SEC about its compliance with the foreign corruption laws and immediately notify them if bribery or accounting fraud violations have “reasonably likely” happened. IBM would also have to report within 60 days of discovering that it is party to any federal investigation, enforcement or civil litigation. IBM’s lawyers at the hearing enumerated steps IBM takes to internally avoid and pursue violation allegations, including a confidential reporting system, and said the company’s board of directors has agreed to Leon’s reporting requirements.

392,IBM,SEC investigating IBM over cloud revenue,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. regulators are investigating how International Business Machines Corp reports revenue from its cloud computing business, the company said on Wednesday. IBM said it learned of the investigation, being conducted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in May. The company made the disclosure in its quarterly report filed with the SEC. It gave no details on the probe. IBM, which does not break out its cloud computing revenue separately, has said it aims to generate $7 billion annually in revenue from cloud services by the end of 2015. Cloud computing lets companies rent computing power, storage and other services from data centers shared with other customers - typically cheaper and more flexible than maintaining their own. Some analysts said the SEC probe likely would not affect IBM much. “At first glance, this may appear to be a concerning issue; however, we believe cloud revenue recognition can be ‘cloudy’ at times, given the nascent stages of its development, and we do not expect a material impact on IBM from this investigation,” said Topeka Capital Markets analyst Brian White. He added that cloud computing can include software, server, storage, network or databases used in different layers of the cloud, and not all have “clear-cut revenue recognition policies.” Last month IBM expanded its cloud offerings with the $2 billion acquisition of SoftLayer Technologies. IBM said it was cooperating with the SEC and repeated a disclosure made on April 30 that the Department of Justice is investigating allegations of illegal activity by a former IBM employee in Poland, as well as transactions in Argentina, Bangladesh and Ukraine. It said the Justice Department is also still seeking information regarding the company’s global compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and its public sector business.

395,IBM,Wall Street finishes lower on uncertainty about Fed's move,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks slid for a second consecutive day on Tuesday after comments from a pair of U.S. Federal Reserve officials left investors uncertain about the timing of a possible reduction in its bond-buying program. Dennis Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, told Market News International in an interview that the Fed could begin trimming the size of the stimulus program as soon as September, but might wait longer if the expected economic growth in the year’s second half fails to materialize. Later in the session, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans echoed the sentiment when he said the central bank will probably decrease the program later this year and could do so as early as next month, depending on the economic data. Fed officials “are all hedging themselves, which is why the market continues to just be a little bit confused and why it is going to churn,” said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York. “There is really no reason at the moment for the market to go higher because it is still too unclear.” One catalyst for Monday’s downturn in the Dow and the S&P; 500 was provided by Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. He said he supported scaling back the central bank’s stimulus next month unless economic data takes a turn for the worse. The S&P; 500’s decline on Tuesday was its biggest fall since June 24 as investors continued to take profits from the recent rally that drove the Dow Jones industrial average and the benchmark S&P; to back-to-back record closing highs late last week.

Volume was light for the second straight day, with about 5.5 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE MKT and Nasdaq, below the daily average of 6.36 billion. The thin volume exaggerated the market’s swings. Monday marked the lowest volume for a full-day session so far this year. With major U.S. economic data like the nonfarm payrolls report and earnings from bellwethers out of the way, volume is expected to be light throughout the week. Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) posted a slightly higher quarterly profit that beat Wall Street’s expectations, even though its movie studio earnings declined, in results released after the closing bell. Disney’s stock fell 1 percent to $66.35 in extended-hours trading. The stock ended regular trading at $67.05, up 1.6 percent. During the regular session, the biggest drag on the Dow was International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N). The stock dropped 2.3 percent to $190.99 after Credit Suisse cut its rating to “underperform” from “neutral,” saying growth would be a challenge for IBM in the future. Credit Suisse also cut its price target on the Dow component by $25 to $175. IBM topped the list of the Dow’s 10 worst-performing stocks. Bank of America (BAC.N) shares declined 1.1 percent to close at $14.64 after the U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil lawsuits against the bank for what government lawyers said was a fraud on investors involving $850 million of residential mortgage-backed securities. The stock was among the Dow’s 10 bottom performers. The S&P; financial index .SPSY lost 0.9 percent. Retailers’ shares were among the day’s biggest losers. American Eagle Outfitters (AEO.N) shares tumbled 12 percent to $17.57 a day after the retailer said its second-quarter profit would be hurt by weak sales and margins. A number of analysts downgraded the stock. The S&P; retail index .SPXRT slipped 0.4 percent. Of the 418 companies in the S&P; 500 that had reported earnings for the second quarter through Tuesday morning, Thomson Reuters data showed that 67.5 percent have topped analysts’ expectations, in line with the average beat over the past four quarters. On the revenue side, the data showed that 54 percent have reported revenue above estimates, more than in the past four quarters but below the historical average.

The selloff accelerated in late morning after Lockhart, in an interview with Market News International that was picked up by a Wall Street Journal blog, said that while the Fed’s easing back on monetary stimulus could come in September, the move could come at any time before the end of the year. “It’s almost as if the market was looking for an excuse to sell, and they found that from Lockhart’s comments. It’s nothing new, but at these levels, any news from the Fed could serve as a good reason to book profits,” said Ryan Detrick, senior strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research in Cincinnati. The steep downturn, which drove the three major U.S. stock indexes down to session lows with the Nasdaq briefly down 1 percent, took place around 11 a.m., a Thomson Reuters chart showed. This move extended declines linked to investors taking profits from the recent rally that lifted the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P; 500 to back-to-back record highs late last week.

Trading volume has been muted, with Monday marking the lightest full-day action of the year, a sign that market participants are largely holding pat near historic levels. Recent market-moving events have moved to the background. The intense investor focus on Federal Reserve policy has receded after last week’s bearish payroll report suggested the Fed would not ease its monetary stimulus soon. In addition, earnings season is winding down.

A number of analysts downgraded the stock. The stock fell 15 percent to $16.90 and weighed on other retailers. Aeropostale dropped 4.9 percent to $14.21 while Gap Inc slid 1.7 percent to $45.51 and Abercrombie & Fitch lost 5.1 percent to $48.94.

Trading volume has been muted, with Monday marking the lightest full-day action of the year, a sign that market participants are largely holding pat near historic levels. Recent market-moving events have moved to the background. The intense investor focus on Federal Reserve policy has receded after last week’s bearish payroll report suggested the Fed would not ease its monetary stimulus soon. In addition, the corporate earnings season is winding down. While about 100 S&P; 500 components are still scheduled to release results, most of the bellwether companies have already reported. “We’re in a post-earnings season environment, and it would take a pretty major catalyst to move us significantly higher from here,” said Art Hogan, managing director at Lazard Capital Markets in New York. “Still, that we’ve been drifting higher without any major pullback augurs that there’s really support for the levels we’re at now. The only thing that could really take us lower would have to be something unexpected.” S&P; 500 futures fell 2.8 points and were below fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures fell 30 points and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 2 points. The S&P; 500 has risen for five of the past six weeks, gaining more than 7 percent over that period.

404,IBM,"China seen probing IBM, Oracle, EMC after Snowden leaks","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s Ministry of Public Security and a cabinet-level research center are preparing to investigate IBM Corp, Oracle Corp and EMC Corp over security issues, the official Shanghai Securities News said on Friday. The report follows revelations by former U.S. spy agency contractor Edward Snowden of widespread surveillance by the National Security Agency. It also comes as Beijing probes Western drugmakers over allegations of bribery and over-pricing. Documents leaked by Snowden revealed that the NSA has had access to vast amounts of Internet data such as emails, chat rooms and video from companies including Facebook Inc and Google Inc, under a government program known as Prism. “At present, thanks to their technological superiority, many of our core information technology systems are basically dominated by foreign hardware and software firms, but the Prism scandal implies security problems,” the newspaper quoted an anonymous source as saying. Officials with EMC, IBM and Oracle declined to comment. China’s Ministry of Public Security also declined to comment. The State Council’s Development Research Centre, one of the groups reportedly involved, told Reuters they were not carrying out such an investigation. China has been a focal point for the Snowden case since he stopped in Hong Kong en route to Moscow. He also claimed that the NSA hacked into critical network infrastructure at universities in China and in Hong Kong. Daniel Castro, a senior analyst with the Information Technology & Information Foundation, said he was concerned that a Chinese government probe could result in demands for U.S. companies to provide authorities with the blueprints to their technology so that Beijing can screen them for potential security threats. China, repeatedly accused by the United States of hacking, was given considerable ammunition by Snowden’s allegations, which Beijing has used to point the finger at Washington for hypocrisy. Chinese regulators and the police have begun a series of investigations in recent weeks into how foreign and domestic companies do business in the world’s second-biggest economy. “The Prism scandal certainly provides ample material for real concern,” said Mark Natkin, managing director of Beijing-based market intelligence firm Marbridge Consulting. “What the scandal has done is make it increasingly difficult to ascertain what is being done out of legitimate concern and what may be being done for any sort of political reasons,” said Natkin. Some experts have warned that Snowden’s leaks could hurt the sales of U.S. technology companies in Asia and Europe, as reports of their complicity with NSA spying programs may lead foreign businesses and governments to purchase equipment and services from non-U.S. suppliers. The foundation, a think tank, last week projected that U.S. cloud computing firms could lose $21.5 billion in sales over the next three years, eventually ceding 10 percent of the foreign market to European and Asian competitors. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), which oversees China’s IT industry, said it could not confirm anything because of the matter’s sensitivity. Another MIIT official told Reuters they were unaware of the reported probe.

407,IBM,"Court halts lawsuits vs. IBM, Daimler, Ford for apartheid crimes","NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Wednesday ruled that three major companies cannot be held liable in the United States for crimes South Africa’s former apartheid government committed, saying a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision “plainly bars” such lawsuits. The plaintiffs brought their suits under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), a law passed in 1789 that allowed non-U.S. citizens to bring cases in U.S. federal courts for violations of international law, such as piracy. In recent decades it took on renewed importance, employed to allow non-U.S. citizens to sue for alleged human rights violations abroad. But a recent Supreme Court decision found that “federal courts may not, under the ATS, recognize common-law causes of action for conduct occurring in the territory of another sovereign,” Circuit Judge Jose Cabranes wrote in the unanimous decision. In April, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that a federal court in New York could not hear claims by 12 Nigerians who accused Anglo-Dutch oil company Royal Dutch Shell Plc of complicity in a violent crackdown on protestors in Nigeria from 1992 to 1995. The case, Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co, was seen as a major victory for multinational corporations. The appeals court ruling on Wednesday could mark the end for plaintiffs in the long-running case, who accused Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), Ford Motor Company (F.N) and International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) of facilitating decades of race-based crimes such as torture and extrajudicial killings because their South African subsidiaries sold products to it.

411,IBM,IBM to transfer U.S. retirees to healthcare exchanges next year,"(Reuters) - IBM plans to move U.S. retirees off its company-sponsored health plan and shift them into new private insurance exchanges as a way of lowering costs for retirees. IBM had selected Extend Health, which is owned by Towers Watson & Co, to provide retirees with new health options for medical, prescription drug, dental and vision coverage, the company said in a statement on Friday. The plan, it said, offered IBM retirees more choice and better value than the company could provide through existing group plans. IBM also said it was hosting meetings with groups of retirees across the country to inform them about the move to the country’s largest private Medicare Exchange. While some retirees may be skeptical, studies showed that the majority of people have a more positive outlook once they were presented with the concept and understood the options available to them through these exchanges, IBM said. Moving retirees to an exchange allows companies to reduce rising health care costs. “IBM didn’t make this change to save money - it does not reduce our costs,” a spokesman said. Projections indicate that healthcare costs under IBM’s current plans for Medicare-eligible retirees would triple by 2020, largely impacting retiree premiums and out-of-pocket costs for retirees, he said. With this move, he added, risks are spread across a much larger group in the private marketplace. According to the website Alliance@IBM, an employee group, the plan will come into effect starting January 1, 2014. IBM, the world’s largest technology-services company, has been reining in costs to ensure stable profits amid slowing demand for hardware. At the end of last month most of its staff in its services and technology group was asked to take a week furlough at one-third of normal pay, according to Alliance@IBM. The company took a $1 billion restructuring charge related to job cuts in its second quarter. The cuts were taken mainly outside of the United States, a spokesman said at the time, adding about 60 percent were from IBM’s services division and 20 percent each from its hardware and software segments.

419,IBM,Australian analyst pleads guilty to insider trading in New York,"NEW YORK, Sept 12 (Reuters) - An Australian financial analyst pleaded guilty in federal court on Thursday to trading on inside information ahead of the $1.2 billion acquisition of software company SPSS by IBM in 2009. Trent Martin, 34, pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. He also admitted to passing the information on to others, including his roommate. “I knew that my actions were wrong in violation of the law,” Martin said in U.S. District Court in New York. At the time, Martin worked as a research analyst in the Stamford, Connecticut, offices of an international financial services firm, prosecutors said. He was arrested in Hong Kong late last year and returned to the United States in March. Last November, the U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged two former stockbrokers, Thomas Conradt and David Weishaus, for their role in the scheme. Conradt and Weishaus worked at the New York office of Euro Pacific Capital Inc., which is based in Westport, Connecticut. Conradt, Martin’s former roommate, pleaded guilty to insider trading charges in April. Weishaus pleaded not guilty. Conradt and Weishaus named Martin as the source of the information in instant messages. “holy f***...god trent told me not to tell anyone...big mistake,” Conradt wrote in one instant message read, according to an indictment. “eh, we’ll get rich,” Weishaus responded. The three and others made more than $1 million by trading before the deal, according to prosecutors. U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter set Martin’s sentencing for March 14. He faces a maximum of five years in prison. Under his bail package, Martin is allowed to live with his parents in Sydney, Australia, until his sentencing or other mandatory court hearings. He has been living with a friend in New York, he said at the hearing. The Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s Office has charged 87 people with insider trading since August 2009, and 74 were convicted. The case is U.S. v.

420,IBM,"India lures chip makers, says IBM and STMicro interested","NEW DELHI/BANGALORE (Reuters) - Two consortiums, including IBM and STMicroelectronics, have proposed building semiconductor wafer plants in India costing a total of $8 billion, a minister said after the government approved concessions to lure chipmakers. India, which wants local production of chips to cut long-term import bills, has renewed a drive to attract investments after a previous attempt failed. The government hopes other chipmakers will show interest in building further plants after the federal cabinet on Thursday approved concessions including subsidies on capital spending, interest-free loans and tax breaks, Communications and Information Technology Minister Kapil Sibal said. “India needs not less than 15 fabs (fabrication units),” Sibal told reporters on Friday. He said that given the huge investments, long build-up period of plants and low freight costs to import chips from abroad there is “no great interest”, and the only way to attract investments was through offering such major concessions. Ganesh Ramamoorthy, a research director at Gartner, said there was little incentive for chipmakers to come to India. “Globally there are established fabs that are struggling to maintain their profitability,” Ramamoorthy said. “Will they be exporting it, will they be competing with other global fabs, or will India be generating enough demand ... these are difficult questions,” the analyst added. The minister said the two consortiums would be asked to submit within two months their detailed project reports, including the production mix and marketing plans. The detailed project reports would be evaluated by a third party, he said. One of the consortiums is made up of India’s Jaiprakash Associates and Israel’s TowerJazz with IBM as technology partner. It has proposed a plant near New Delhi at a cost of 263 billion rupees ($4 billion), the government said. The second comprises Hindustan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp and Malaysia’s Silterra with STMicroelectronics as the technology partner. The proposed investment at 252.5 billion rupees for a plant in the western state of Gujarat. A Jaiprakash spokesman declined comment. The Indian units of IBM and STMicroelectronics said they would not give an immediate comment. The technology providers must take at least a 10 percent stake in the projects, while the Indian government would get an 11 percent stake in each project. The government would part-fund the investments through interest-free loans for 10 years. India’s demand for electronics products is forecast to rise nearly 10 times during this decade to reach $400 billion by 2020, causing policy makers to worry that electronics imports, with no major local manufacturing, could exceed those of oil. As sales of smartphones, computers and television sets surge, annual imports of semiconductors are expected to touch $50 billion by 2020 from $7 billion in 2010, according to an Indian government presentation. Typically, semiconductor foundries take about two years to be up and running, Gartner’s Ramamoorthy said.

421,IBM,"REFILE-UPDATE 1-India lures chip makers, says IBM and STMicro interested","By Devidutta Tripathy and Harichandan Arakali NEW DELHI/BANGALORE, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Two consortiums, including IBM and STMicroelectronics, have proposed building semiconductor wafer plants in India costing a total of $8 billion, a minister said after the government approved concessions to lure chipmakers. India, which wants local production of chips to cut long-term import bills, has renewed a drive to attract investments after a previous attempt failed. The government hopes other chipmakers will show interest in building further plants after the federal cabinet on Thursday approved concessions including subsidies on capital spending, interest-free loans and tax breaks, Communications and Information Technology Minister Kapil Sibal said. “India needs not less than 15 fabs (fabrication units),” Sibal told reporters on Friday. He said that given the huge investments, long build-up period of plants and low freight costs to import chips from abroad there is “no great interest”, and the only way to attract investments was through offering such major concessions. Ganesh Ramamoorthy, a research director at Gartner, said  there was little incentive for chipmakers to come to India. “Globally there are established fabs that are struggling to maintain their profitability,” Ramamoorthy said. “Will they be exporting it, will they be competing with other global fabs, or will India be generating enough demand ... these are difficult questions,” the analyst added. The minister said the two consortiums would be asked to submit within two months their detailed project reports, including the production mix and marketing plans. The detailed project reports would be evaluated by a third party, he said. One of the consortiums is made up of India’s Jaiprakash Associates and Israel’s TowerJazz with IBM as technology partner. It has proposed a plant near New Delhi at a cost of 263 billion rupees ($4 billion), the government said. The second comprises Hindustan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp and Malaysia’s Silterra with STMicroelectronics as the technology partner. The proposed investment at 252.5 billion rupees for a plant in the western state of Gujarat. A Jaiprakash spokesman declined comment. The Indian units of IBM and STMicroelectronics said they would not give an immediate comment. The technology providers must take at least a 10 percent stake in the projects, while the Indian government would get an 11 percent stake in each project. The government would part-fund the investments through interest-free loans for 10 years. India’s demand for electronics products is forecast to rise nearly 10 times during this decade to reach $400 billion by 2020, causing policy makers to worry that electronics imports, with no major local manufacturing, could exceed those of oil. As sales of smartphones, computers and television sets surge, annual imports of semiconductors are expected to touch $50 billion by 2020 from $7 billion in 2010, according to an Indian government presentation. Typically, semiconductor foundries take about two years to be up and running, Gartner’s Ramamoorthy said.

423,IBM,UPDATE 1-US court rules in favor of Amazon in CIA contract dispute,"Oct 7 (Reuters) - A U.S. court ruled in favor of Amazon.com Inc in the online retailer’s dispute with IBM  over a $600 million cloud computing contract awarded by the Central Intelligence Agency, a court notice showed. Amazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud services unit of Amazon.com, beat IBM to win the CIA contract earlier this year. IBM protested the award, triggering a report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO). The GAO recommended in June that the CIA re-do parts of the contract and give IBM another chance to bid. Amazon then filed a legal complaint against the recommendations. On Monday, Judge Thomas Wheeler of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled against IBM after hearing oral arguments. A written opinion will follow, according to a court notice. International Business Machines said it was disappointed with the ruling and planned to appeal the decision. “This court decision seems especially inappropriate in light of the current times, since IBM’s bid was superior in many ways, including being substantially more cost-effective,” the company said in an emailed statement. Amazon was not immediately available for comment. Public cloud computing, which AWS pioneered in 2006, lets companies rent computing power, storage and other services from data centers shared with other customers. The services typically are cheaper and more flexible for companies than maintaining their own hardware. The case is in re Amazon Web Services Inc vs United States, Case No. 13-00506, U.S. Court of Federal Claims.

424,IBM,IBM's China-driven slump sparks executive shakeup,"(Reuters) - IBM Corp has reassigned the head of its growth markets unit, a source with knowledge of the move said, after a surprisingly steep drop in quarterly hardware sales in China prompted a 7 percent share slide on Thursday. James Bramante’s reassignment was first flagged during the company’s conference call on Wednesday, when Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said sales chief Bruno Di Leo would be taking over at the unit, which oversees growth markets for the company. “They know how to get this done,” Loughridge told analysts on the call, referring to Di Leo and his team. “They helped build this to begin with.” IBM declined to comment, and the source did not say where Bramante would be reassigned. The shakeup comes amid concerns that International Business Machines Corp, which is moving steadily into higher-margin businesses such as software and cloud computing, is struggling to sustain growth through its emerging markets business. The company reported a worse-than-expected 4 percent dip in third-quarter revenue, its sixth straight quarterly decline. Much of that came from a 17 percent slide in overall hardware. Profitability in that business has declined by $1 billion so far this year. At least eight brokerages cut their price targets on the stock by as much as 9.5 percent to between $160 and $220, while analysts at UBS Investment Research downgraded the stock to “neutral” from “buy. The latest quarterly disappointment deals another blow to Chairman and CEO Ginni Rometty in her first year as head of the board. Including Thursday’s plunge, IBM’s stock has dropped 15 percent since she stepped up as chairman compared with the S&P; 500’s 18 percent gain. “We are concerned about future earnings power. IBM has been successful in multiple computing waves in the past but we believe the execution issues combined with the weak IT spending environment will hold back any potential revenue growth,” UBS analysts said in a note to clients. Loughridge blamed much of the revenue decline on China, which accounts for about 5 percent of IBM’s business. About 40 percent of that business is hardware. He said the country was working on a nationwide economic reform plan ahead of a major government plenary session in November, which depressed sales. Much of China’s corporate sector is dominated by the state in a centrally planned economy, and government enterprises often hold back on spending in the run-up to major nationwide policy changes. But he also admitted that about half of the decline was due to “execution” issues, noting that Di Leo’s appointment was aimed at addressing a “leadership differential.” IBM shares closed down 6.4 percent at $174.83 on the New York Stock Exchange after touching a two-year low of $172.57. That marked their steepest one-day slide since April 19, also triggered by disappointing sales. The world’s largest technology services company reiterated its full-year profit outlook, but analysts raised doubts about the company’s ability to convert services backlog to revenue. IBM has reported a decline in revenue for six straight quarters. “Software has been the growth engine for IBM and has been one of the key reasons investors held the stock. However, it appears that the engine may have stalled and no longer can outgrow the broader software market,” J.P. Morgan analysts said in a note. IBM, which sold its personal computer business to Lenovo Group Ltd in 2005, has been shifting to a more software-focused business.

At least nine brokerages cut their price targets by as much as 9.5 percent, while analysts at UBS Investment Research downgraded the stock to “neutral” from “buy”. “We think IBM’s market positioning mainly in infrastructure with database and middleware is becoming riskier as customers shift to the cloud,” Societe Generale analysts wrote.

427,IBM,"Dow, S&P; 500 end at highs on stimulus hopes, IBM","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow and S&P; 500 ended at record highs on Tuesday after economic data supported views that the Federal Reserve would keep its stimulus intact for several months and IBM (IBM.N) rallied after the company announced a stock buyback. IBM gave the biggest boost to the Dow, which led the day’s gains. The stock, which also helped drive the S&P; 500’s advance, jumped 2.7 percent to $182.12 after the company’s board of directors approved another $15 billion for stock buybacks. In the latest economic data, a gauge of U.S. consumer spending rose in September, but another report showed consumer confidence fell sharply in October because of worries about the impact of the partial government shutdown. The data added to evidence of sluggish economic growth just as the Fed began a two-day policy meeting. Expectations are high that officials are unlikely to shift monetary policy this week as they wait for more evidence of how badly Washington’s budget battle has hurt the U.S. economy. “The ghosts of tapering are not coming this Halloween,” said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer for equities at Charles Schwab Corp. “The government shutdown pushed the tapering discussion further out.” That’s likely to keep a floor under stocks for the near term at least, though longer term, slow growth in earnings and especially in revenue may be a concern, he said. Limiting some of the day’s gains in both the Nasdaq and the S&P; 500, Apple (AAPL.O) shares dropped 2.5 percent to $516.68 a day after the iPad and iPhone maker delivered disappointing results. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI gained 111.42 points, or 0.72 percent, to end at 15,680.35, a record close. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX rose 9.84 points, or 0.56 percent, to finish at 1,771.95, also a record closing high. The S&P; 500 hit another intraday record high at 1,772.09. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC advanced 12.21 points, or 0.31 percent, to close at 3,952.34. Tuesday’s rally brings the S&P; 500’s gain for the year to date to 24.2 percent. In the latest technical issue to befall the Nasdaq exchange, the Nasdaq OMX Group (NDAQ.O) said human error left the exchange unable to transmit index values for nearly 45 minutes, leading to a temporary halt in options trading on some stock indexes. After the bell, shares of LinkedIn LNKD.N dropped 3.1 percent to $239.45 after the social networking company for recruiters and job seekers gave a conservative revenue forecast for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2013. LinkedIn shares ended the regular session at $247.14, up 1.7percent. Shares of video game publisher Electronic Arts Inc (EA.O) rose 2.8 percent to $24.80 in extended-hours trading after the company reported a higher quarterly profit. In regular trading, Electronic Arts shares fell 2.8 percent to close at $24.13. During the regular session, the Dow also got a boost from Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), which rose 1.7 percent to $31.25 after the largest U.S. drugmaker reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings. As has been the case in recent quarters, more companies have been beating analysts’ earnings expectations than revenue expectations. With results in from 281 of the S&P; 500 companies, 68.7 percent have topped profit expectations, above the long-term average of 63 percent, while just 52.5 percent have beaten revenue estimates, below the 61 percent rate since 2002, based on Thomson Reuters data. Cummins Inc (CMI.N) slumped 5.2 percent to $127.90. It was the S&P; 500’s worst performer after the U.S. maker of engines and other vehicle components reported lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday and cut its full-year outlook. Another decliner was JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), down 0.1 percent at $52.73 after a person familiar with the situation said the preliminary $13 billion deal set by the bank’s CEO and the U.S. attorney general has hit a stumbling block.

429,IBM,"Swisscom builds ""Swiss Cloud"" as spying storm rages","* Doubts over data security on U.S.-owned servers * Switzerland has long tradition for privacy * Swisscom can only guarantee data security within borders * Improvements in technology will put focus on location By Caroline Copley ZURICH, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Swisscom is building a “Swiss Cloud” that could loosen the grip of U.S. technology giants and attract foreign companies looking for a way to shield sensitive data from the prying eyes of foreign intelligence services. Companies are increasingly turning to cloud computing - an umbrella term for technology services such as email and business software offered remotely via the Internet instead of on-site - to cut costs and add flexibility to their IT departments. But revelations that the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) secretly gathered user data from nine big U.S. tech companies including Google, Apple and Facebook  has demonstrated that privacy for users of cloud services can be compromised, and some suggest customers could seek out alternatives to the dominant U.S. providers to try and protect sensitive information. Swisscom’s head of IT services Andreas Koenig told Reuters the telecom provider’s decision to set up a home cloud was unrelated to the recent NSA revelations and driven more by a desire to cut costs and make its systems more dynamic. Still, as the technology to protect against illegal threats progresses, Koenig says it will start to make more sense to store data in locations where strict privacy laws make it harder to retrieve sensitive information. “Data protection and privacy is a long tradition in Switzerland, and that’s why it’s pretty difficult to get to something,” Koenig said. “But if legal requirements are there and we are asked by the judge to obtain or deliver certain information then we would obviously have to comply with it.” Unlike in the United States, where the 2001 Patriot Act and the 2008 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISAA) gives U.S. intelligence agencies the power to carry out mass information gathering, Swisscom would have to receive a formal request from a prosecutor before allowing access to data. Yet while Swiss privacy laws will govern data stored locally in Switzerland, Swisscom says it is hard to guarantee the security of data that crosses borders, such as information exchanged by employees working in different countries. Concern over the extent of foreign intelligence access to data has unnerved many countries, including Germany, where state-backed Deutsche Telekom wants communications firms to collaborate to shield local internet traffic. Swisscom, which is majority-owned by the Swiss government, wants to be at the forefront of new technology to monitor and detect illegal threats, such as hacking. “If you are a provider in a cloud environment you need to apply the highest standards of security you can get,” said Koenig, adding the company was implementing new ways to look at intrusion and data threats. He said improvements in technology such as HTML 5, a new programming language for websites that can support apps on many different platforms, would make it harder to retrieve data. “It’s like opening a data tunnel from the server to your screen and then displaying the data on your screen. That makes it pretty, pretty difficult for anyone to see what’s there.” In Switzerland, which upholds privacy and data secrecy for its citizens and has long profited from providing discreet banking services to foreigners, the NSA surveillance furore is particularly sensitive. The Swiss government is worried about surveillance of Switzerland’s more than $2 trillion financial centre and is seeking measures to ensure against spying, Basler Zeitung reported last week, citing sources. Swisscom is subject to regulation requiring it to store all client data in Switzerland. The company counts banks among its biggest clients, and the country’s financial regulator FINMA also stipulates that data and data transfer must happen within Switzerland. For now, the company is focusing on its Swiss-based clients but says it would have the capacity to support demand from foreign companies seeking a privacy haven. Koenig declined to disclose how much Swisscom was investing in its cloud nor how much it was planning to charge potential clients for the service, but said it would be competitive with other providers such as Amazon Web Services and International Business Machines. He said Swisscom’s goal was to have 70 percent of its own IT infrastructure in the cloud by 2016, the equivalent of 200-300 petabytes of data. According to analysts at Deloitte Analytics, it would take 223,000 DVDs to hold just one petabyte.",11032013,http://www.reuters.com/article/swisscom-cloud/swisscom-builds-swiss-cloud-as-spying-storm-rages-idUSL5N0IM1XR20131103
430,IBM,"In patent showdown, IBM's arsenal dwarfs Twitter's","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp’s patent demand against Twitter Inc as it approaches an initial public offering highlights how few patents the social media company possesses compared with the established tech players. IBM has accused Twitter of infringing three IBM patents, one of which relates to online advertising, according to a Twitter securities filing on Monday. Twitter said it has “meritorious defenses” to those claims, and IBM has not filed a lawsuit. A Twitter spokesman declined to comment beyond the filing, and an IBM representative also declined to comment. Long a prodigious stockpiler of intellectual property, IBM currently holds nearly 87,000 U.S. patents and published applications, according to a government database. Twitter, meanwhile, has only three. This suggests that the legal maneuvers involving IBM and Twitter will increase the pressure on Twitter to buy more patents, in order to build its leverage against older tech companies, patent experts say. “It’s not about the patents, it’s about signaling to the market that you have a strong position so people don’t line up to sue you,” said Ron Laurie, a specialist in IP and investment banking for Inflexion Point Strategy. Patent claims against companies approaching an IPO are relatively common, as plaintiffs hope the need for a target company to minimize risks might force a lucrative settlement. In September, Twitter was sued twice for patent infringement the same week it announced its plans to go public, according to records maintained by Westlaw, a Thomson Reuters unit. Twitter raised the top end of its IPO price range by 25 percent on Monday, to $23 to $25 per share. Last year Yahoo Inc sued Facebook Inc for patent infringement two months before Facebook’s IPO. Yahoo eventually withdrew the lawsuit after a new Yahoo chief executive took over. However, Facebook ramped up a patent-buying spree shortly after the lawsuit was filed. Facebook bought 750 patents from IBM for an undisclosed sum, and then paid Microsoft Corp $550 million for hundreds of patents that originated with AOL. Leading up to its IPO, Facebook had disclosed 559 U.S. patents and applications. The company currently owns 2,151 patents and applications, according to the government’s database. Twitter has been vocal in the ongoing debate over how strong patent protections should be when it comes to software. Last year the company announced that it would not use patents for offensive purposes without permission from the employee who invented the technology. The company would only use patents defensively, it said, which means the patents could be used to countersue anyone who had struck first. While the specific patents cited by IBM may not stand up in court, it is the threat from a company with so many resources that affects Twitter. “It may turn out that these patents, under close scrutiny, are not terribly impactful,” said Sanjay Prasad, an intellectual property consultant in Silicon Valley. “But there’s a different issue of public perception, and in an IPO that can be important.” ",11042013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-patents/in-patent-showdown-ibms-arsenal-dwarfs-twitters-idUSBRE9A30ZW20131104

While the specific patents cited by IBM may not stand up in court, it is the threat from a company with so many resources that affects Twitter. “It may turn out that these patents, under close scrutiny, are not terribly impactful,” said Sanjay Prasad, an intellectual property consultant in Silicon Valley. “But there’s a different issue of public perception, and in an IPO that can be important.”",11042013,http://www.reuters.com/article/twitter-patents/in-patent-showdown-ibms-arsenal-dwarfs-twitters-idUSL2N0IP1H120131104
432,IBM,Analysis: Rewards shift to stock pickers in U.S. market rally,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - It’s a good time to be a stock picker. Some 57 percent of U.S. funds run by active managers are beating their benchmark indexes this year, according to fund-tracker Morningstar. That is the best overall performance for the industry since 2009 and well above the 37 percent of funds that typically top the indexes. Stock pickers are doing well in part because after more than four years of marching higher en masse, stocks have started to separate themselves into leaders and laggards. The lines of demarcation became more pronounced during the past few weeks as U.S. companies reported their recent quarterly results. Nearly 69 percent of companies are beating analyst estimates in the third-quarter - that’s typical, but this season the misses are not concentrated in any particular sectors. Each sector has had its share of high-profile shortfalls. Look no further than technology: Thomson Reuters data shows that 84 percent of the 55 tech companies reporting so far surpassed earnings forecasts. Yet investors sent IBM to a 2-year low on weak sales figures, and several chipmakers took a hit after issuing disappointing forecasts. Implied correlations - a measure of how closely the performance of individual stocks mirrors that of the index itself - have fallen to their lowest since October 2007 after peaking in 2011, according to a research note from Cantor Fitzgerald. That means that instead of the returns of most stocks clumping close to the index returns, there is a much broader spread on how individual shares are performing. That’s a sign that investors are picking winners and losers. It also suggests the bull market - which has carried the S&P; nearly 170 percent higher since March 2009 - is starting to show its age. The S&P; 500 has set 33 new highs this year after failing to reach record levels since 2007. Now there are fewer beaten-down stocks that offer the chance for a quick pop higher. Instead of searching for screaming bargains, fund managers are turning their focus to well-run companies that have sustainable advantages and may hold their value during a downturn, however unlikely that may seem at the moment. “Ultimately as any recovery ages you start to see a selection process where better executing companies are afforded more attention. The general ‘trade the group’ strategy does not quite hold as well and you have to be more careful,” said Michael Sansoterra, the manager of the $289 million Ridgeworth Large Cap Growth fund. There are several reasons for the growing disparity in corporate performance. For the past four years, companies benefited from the rising tide, and some were able to use stock buybacks and dividend hikes to fuel share prices even when operating performances was not up to snuff. The Federal Reserve’s economic stimulus program, which has put a lid on interest rates and allowed companies to refinance their debt cheaply, also helped lower-quality companies shine. Now, as third-quarter earnings reports reveal which companies have stronger or weaker sales prospects and profit margins, choosy investment managers are rewarding stronger companies and walking away from those that display weakness. Shares of United Continental Holdings, for instance, fell as much as 4 percent on October 24 after the airline operator missed analyst estimates because of high costs and unused seats. Analysts from JP Morgan, Raymond James and Evercore Partners cut their outlooks for the company, citing its poor results, while revenues are growing at other airlines. Shares of Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines have continued to rally as a result of a pickup in business travel and thinner competition. For the year, Delta is up 123 percent, compared with United’s 45 percent rise. Among clothing companies, VF Corp rose 5 percent on October 21 to an all-time high after it beat estimates on strong demand for its Timberland, Vans and the North Face brands. VF Corp is up 42 percent for the year, while competitors like Gap Inc., Ralph Lauren and Abercrombie & Fitch Co have lagged the broad market after missing sales targets and relying on heavier discounts during the back-to-school shopping period. Gap, for instance, is up 19 percent for the year, while Abercrombie is down 22 percent. Managers complain that finding hidden gems is increasingly challenging as the most promising companies are already pricey and there are no obvious bargains. “It gets harder now that the market has gone up and you have to avoid overpaying for growth,” said Craig Watson, a portfolio specialist who works on the $19.8 billion T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth fund and the firm’s other large-cap funds. The fund is up 32.5 percent for the year, or about 7 percentage points more than the S&P; 500. His Blue Chip Growth fund added to its position in Amazon.com despite its 43 percent gain for the year because of its strong management and earnings potential, Watson said. “If you are taking a longer-term view like we are, then something that may look expensive today won’t look like it is in two or three years because the company is so well-managed,” Watson said. John Fox co-manages the $902 million FAM Value Fund, whose 28 percent gain for the year puts him 2 percentage points ahead of the S&P; 500. He said the rush to equities by investors looking for yield has stretched valuations. The fund, which has 42 stocks, has added only four new positions this year, compared with the 12 Fox bought “in only a few weeks” during the fall of 2011, he said. Fox’s most recent purchase: Forest City Enterprises Inc, a commercial real estate developer that is up 25 percent for the year. Fox likes its plan to sell some of its assets and focus on the higher-end New York and Washington, D.C., markets, and estimates that the stock could jump 15 percent from its current price of about $20.26. Bill Smead, who has steered his $530 million Smead Value Fund to a 30 percent gain for the year, is optimistic that the gains in the U.S. housing market will keep pushing stocks higher. He has been adding to his position in Walt Disney Co, for instance, because he expects that more families will opt for vacations at its amusement parks as their home values rise. Shares of Disney are up 37.8 percent for the year. Still, he longs for the volatility - and subsequent correlations - of the market of the past few years. “You don’t like to see people going on TV talking about how great stocks are,” he said. “That stuff bothers you when you’re picking stocks. You want to be in an environment where no one agrees with you.” ",11042013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-stockpicking-earnings-analysis/analysis-rewards-shift-to-stock-pickers-in-u-s-market-rally-idUSBRE9A304Y20131104
433,IBM,"Spy scandal weighs on U.S. tech firms in China, Cisco takes hit","SINGAPORE (Reuters) - U.S. technology companies including Cisco Systems Inc, International Business Machines Corp and Microsoft Corp may face new challenges selling their goods and services in China as fallout from the U.S. spying scandal starts to take a toll. Cisco shares tumbled 11 percent on Thursday, a day after it warned that revenue could drop as much as 10 percent this quarter, and continue to contract through the middle of next year, in part due to a backlash in China after revelations about U.S. government surveillance programs. “All the big U.S. IT companies are concerned,” said Jim Lewis, a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic Studies in Washington, who is an expert on China and technology. “But so far Cisco is bearing the brunt of it.” Lewis said Beijing may be targeting Cisco in particular as retaliation for Washington’s refusal to buy goods from China’s Huawei Technologies Co, a telecommunications equipment maker that the United States claims is a threat to its national security because of links to the Chinese military. Cisco’s much smaller network equipment rival Juniper Networks said on Thursday that it was not seeing an impact from leaks by former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden about U.S. spying. “The Snowden effect is not real,” Juniper Chief Marketing Officer Brad Brooks said. “Our business continues to grow in Asia Pac as well as China. As we look at that business there we’ve not seen those types of conversations from our customers.” Snowden’s revelations provoked a storm in the Chinese media and added urgency to Beijing’s efforts to use its market power to create indigenous software and hardware, analysts and business executives say. “The U.S. government isn’t doing any favors for Cisco,” said Evercore Partners analyst Mark McKechnie. Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers said on a conference call that Cisco and its peers face “challenging political dynamics” in China. IBM last month reported a 22 percent drop in China revenue, leading to a 4 percent decline in its third-quarter profit. Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge attributed the company’s problems to the “process surrounding China’s development of a broad-based economic reform plan,” which caused delays in purchases. Microsoft executives singled out China as the company’s weakest performing area in the world during the September quarter in an October 24 earnings call. “The macro conditions in China, which I think are consistent with what some of the other companies have reported as well, have been challenging,” said Chris Suh, Microsoft’s general manager for investor relations. Company officials could not be reached for comment. Beijing has long mistrusted foreign technology companies, and those concerns have been exacerbated since Snowden first revealed the existence of the NSA’s clandestine data mining program in June. “This is all about China using its own technology, and China building leading technology companies,” said James McGregor, chairman for Greater China at consultancy APCO Worldwide. Although Beijing has not prohibited state firms from purchasing Western-made technology services and equipment, the government has sent a clear message to choose Chinese-made equipment first, China-based executives say. “While a formal document hasn’t been issued, in the future we will try to buy IT equipment from domestic brands, such as Lenovo,” said a person familiar with technology purchases at one of China’s four big state-owned banks. “The government’s signal is pretty clear - they want to rely less on U.S. products, such as IOE (IBM, Oracle and EMC Corp),” said a former China-based telecommunications executive. Oracle officials could not be reached. Representatives with EMC and IBM declined to comment. In August, the National Development and Reform Commission, China’s top economic planning body, published a statement setting cyber-security standards for financial institutions, cloud computing and big data, information system secrecy management and industrial controls. Four domestic software and hardware makers, including China National Software & Service Co, announced this month they have received a “top-tier” rating from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. China National Software’s share price has gained nearly 250 percent since the Snowden revelations. “We hope and demand that relevant foreign companies respect China’s laws,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said on Thursday, when asked about Cisco’s woes. “At the same time, as the Chinese government we of course have an obligation, a responsibility, to protect the country’s security.” Snowden’s revelations have reverberated in other big emerging markets such as Brazil, Mexico and India. Cisco CFO Frank Calderoni said China was where the company was most affected by a political backlash, but noted that it was difficult to quantify how much of its revenue shortfall was due to politics versus macroeconomic trends. To be sure, the impact of any Snowden scandal backlash is unlikely to hit all U.S. tech firms equally. Cisco is perhaps most vulnerable, experts said, because it competes with two well-established Chinese telecommunications equipment providers: Huawei and ZTE. Chinese companies are less competitive in producing semiconductors and database software, which means that any fallout from the scandal will have less impact on U.S. firms in those areas. “Everyone is feeling the heat from the NSA revelations,” said a former employee at a major multinational technology firm. The important point, however, was that companies like IBM don’t have competitors for their high-end equipment, the expert added. “If they don’t buy from IBM they can’t buy from anyone else.” ",11142013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-cisco/spy-scandal-weighs-on-u-s-tech-firms-in-china-cisco-takes-hit-idUSBRE9AD0J420131114
434,IBM,UPDATE 2-Buffett's Berkshire buys sizable new Exxon Mobil stake,"* $3.45 billion stake disclosed in Exxon * Exxon shares have lagged market, rise after-hours   (Adds analyst comments, other holdings) By Jonathan Stempel and Luciana Lopez Nov 14 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc   on Thursday disclosed a new $3.45 billion stake in Exxon Mobil Corp, after buying 40.1 million shares in the world’s largest publicly traded oil company. Although the investment represents just 0.9 percent of Houston-based Exxon’s shares, analysts said it reflects strong support by the second-richest American of one of the world’s largest and most profitable companies. “When Warren Buffett gives his seal of approval to any company, that is never a bad thing,” said Pavel Molchanov, energy analyst at Raymond James & Associates, who rates Exxon shares a “strong buy.” Exxon shares rose 84 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $94.06 in after-hours trading following Berkshire’s disclosure of its stake in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing that listed most of its equity investments as of Sept. 30. The shares had risen 63 cents during regular trading. “He likes buying big, established global brand names, and Exxon is a good flight-to-quality stock,” said Fadel Gheit, senior oil analyst at Oppenheimer & Co, referring to Buffett.     “The stock has also lagged the market in the last three and five years. That makes it a typical Warren Buffett holding.” Gheit has a “perform” rating on Exxon. Berkshire already has energy and utilities businesses, including MidAmerican Energy, which is spending $5.6 billion to buy Nevada utility NV Energy Inc. U.S. regulators require large investors to disclose their stock holdings every quarter, and the disclosures can offer a window into their strategies for buying and selling stocks. Buffett sometimes gets SEC permission to delay disclosures so that he can buy stocks without having investors copy him. He did this for the second quarter of 2013, and revealed on Thursday that Exxon purchases took place during that period. “We appreciate the confidence investors have in ExxonMobil when they decide to invest in the company,” Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said in an email. Berkshire last reported owning Exxon shares in late 2011. Debbie Bosanek, an assistant to Buffett, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Buffett typically makes Berkshire’s largest investments, while other investments are made by portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. Berkshire’s quarterly filings do not reveal who buys or sells what. The company ended September with $104.9 billion of equities. Its four top holdings - American Express Co, Coca-Cola Co, International Business Machines Corp and Wells Fargo & Co - totaled $58.4 billion. During the quarter, Berkshire also reduced by 44 percent its share stake in oil company ConocoPhillips. Through Thursday, ConocoPhillips’ stock was up 27.1 percent in 2013, while Exxon rose just 7.7 percent. The Energy Selector Sector SPDR exchange-traded fund was up 22.1 percent. “Buffett is a classic value investor, and Exxon has been an underloved stock in a bull market,” Molchanov said. “Exxon is an amazing cash generating machine, which should generate $16 billion of free cash flow this year.” Berkshire also reported higher stakes in Bank of New York Mellon Corp, dialysis clinic operator DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc, satellite TV provider DIRECTV, Suncor Energy Co, US Bancorp and Verisign Inc , which assigns Internet protocol addresses. Its stake in drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc fell. Berkshire also owns more than 80 businesses in such areas as insurance, railroads, utilities, chemicals and food. It paid $12.3 billion in June for half of ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co. On Thursday, Berkshire’s Class A shares rose 0.7 percent to $173,320, and its Class B shares rose 0.8 percent to $115.69.

437,IBM,CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-Australia's Freelancer soars on debut as investors pile into outsourcing,"(Corrects year of loss to 2011 in 10th paragraph) By Maggie Lu Yueyang SYDNEY, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Australian jobs portal Freelancer Ltd soared up to 400 percent on its debut on Friday as investors scrambled to own shares in one of the few established companies in the rapidly growing Internet outsourcing market. The world’s biggest freelancing and outsourcing marketplace by user numbers briefly touched a market capitalisation of A$1 billion ($932.35 million) as it began trading on the Australian stock exchange after its A$17.55 million IPO. Zillow Inc backer Caledonia Investments, Facebook Inc  founding investor Joel Sng and Seek Ltd founder Andrew Bassat were among the new shareholders willing to put their money behind the small, Sydney-based company. “Online staffing has been a major growth trend over the past few years. Freelancer.com is an important part of that emerging sector,” said Rod Hore, executive director at recruitment industry advisor HHMC Australia. “Freelancer.com has worked very hard to position itself globally, not just in Australia.” Founded only four years ago, Freelancer matches employers and freelancers around the world for tasks such as data entry, design and accounting. It has almost 9.5 million users from 247 countries and more than 5 million projects posted, with clients paying a fee once a job is filled. The global online staffing market cracked the $1 billion milestone in 2012 and will grow to $5 billion by 2018, according to San Francisco-based Staffing Industry Analysts. But there are still relatively few established players in the industry. Freelancer’s biggest rivals include U.S. firm Elance, which this week announced a “strategic partnership” with IBM Corp to link app developers with talent providers around the world. [ID: nMKWTk1R9a] Such firms offer employers and job-seekers an alternative to more traditional job websites such as Monster Worldwide Inc  and Seek, which operate more like classified ads platforms than vehicles for tendering job contracts. But it is still very early days for Freelancer, which recovered from a net loss of A$476,000 in 2011 to post a net profit of A$728,000 last year. It expects revenue to grow 73 percent to A$18.3 million this year, for a net profit after tax of A$819,000 excluding IPO costs. “The company plans to continue reinvesting strategically to achieve growth, which may result in a period of minimal operating profits,” company founder Matt Barrie, an IT engineer, said in the prospectus. Barrie holds 46 percent of the business, a stake worth about A$321 million after Friday’s strong listing. Investment fund Startive Capital owns another 39 percent. Freelancer sold 35.1 million new shares or only 8.1 percent of the company in the initial public offering, which was underwritten by Sydney-based advisory firm KTM Capital Ltd. The stock was offered at A$0.50 per share and closed at A$1.60, valuing the firm at A$697.6 million. “On the face, the price is telling us that this float is underpriced,” CMC Markets strategist Michael McCarthy said. “But because they only sold a small amount of the 436 million shares, that’s not a problem for them. What they’ve essentially done is establish a market value of this company.” The new market capitalisation appears to justify Barrie’s rejection of several attempts to buy the company, including a $400 million approach from Japanese recruitment firm Recruit Holdings Co. But the company now needs to live up to the market’s high expectations, said Rivkin Securities director Shannon Rivkin. “This has been valued at pretty silly numbers right now and it’s a great story, but a lot of good things need to happen for it to be worth anywhere near the current price,” he said. The offer capitalised on a revival in the Australian IPO market and strong interest in non-resources stocks as the country’s mining investment boom wanes. Australia’s IPO market has picked up with more than $1 billion raised in the first three quarters of 2013 compared with $227 million over the same period a year earlier.

440,IBM,CenturyLink boosts cloud offerings with Tier 3 buy,"(Reuters) - Telecommunications company CenturyLink Inc said on Tuesday it has bought cloud computing startup Tier 3 Inc as part of its acquisition strategy that allows it to compete with the likes of Amazon Inc, IBM Corp and Verizon Communications Inc’s Terremark. The company did not disclose financial details, but a source close to the matter said the price was around $200 million. Monroe, Louisiana-based CenturyLink, which acquired telecom company Qwest Communications in 2011, has been building its cloud services. It bought data center provider Savvis in July 2011 for $2.5 billion and in June of this year it purchased AppFog, a platform as a service company.

442,IBM,UPDATE 2-HP shares jump on turnaround hopes; margins a concern,"(Adds analyst comment, details on forecast, background and byline) By Poornima Gupta and Neha Alawadhi Nov 27 (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co shares soared near their 52-week high on Wednesday after investors saw signs a turnaround plan was gaining traction, but Wall Street worried the improvement was coming at the expense of margins. HP shares jumped nearly 10 percent to $27.56 in afternoon trading, after at least one brokerage raised its rating on the PC maker’s shares and another nine raised their price targets. Expectations had been low for HP’s fourth quarter following a disappointing third quarter and after rivals IBM and Cisco Systems Inc reported poor results. But HP surprised on Tuesday, reporting stronger-than-expected revenue due to growth in its enterprise group, which supplies servers, storage and networking products to corporations. “HP appears to continue to struggle with improving its margins and share together, despite substantial cost cuts - particular in its enterprise business - and we worry about profitless prosperity,” Bernstein Research analyst Toni Sacconaghi said in a note to clients. Chief Executive Meg Whitman said Tuesday the company needed to improve margins, even as HP’s enterprise sales rose 2 percent compared with a year earlier and 12 percent versus the previous quarter. The cause for concern was that its key operating margin slipped to 9 percent in the quarter from 10.4 percent a year earlier, reflecting aggressive pricing and discounts on products as it competes with rivals like Dell Inc and Lenovo Group Ltd . Brian Alexander, an analyst with Raymond James, said the quarterly results showed “HP is still trying to strike a balance between growth and profitability.” Whitman, who took the helm a little more than a year ago, is trying to put HP back on the growth path though layoffs and focusing on businesses with longer-term potential, such as enterprise and remote computing services. “HP is cutting costs and headcount, but we believe challenges remain structural, with the company still tuned to selling high volumes of relatively low value-add products/services, likely keeping margins under pressure,” Evercore analyst Rob Cihra said in a note. Overall revenue for the fourth quarter was $29.1 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $27.9 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. HP maintained its full-year earnings forecast, which J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Mark Moskowitz said was “more than plenty good after Cisco’s big disappointment.” Moskowitz, who raised his price target to $30 from $29, said HP’s comments on PCs, printing and the enterprise group could suggest a potential bottoming in the company’s model, which could attract value-based and long-term investors. The company, which has been moving away from a declining PC industry, reported a smaller-than-expected drop in PC sales. “In short, HP didn’t guide down for 2014 and that is quite positive so far versus many in ‘old tech,’” Barclays analyst Ben Reitzes said in a research note. He raised his price target to $28 from $26. Some analysts were concerned a slowdown in China would hurt HP. Cisco had warned of weakness in China, while IBM’s sales in China declined in the latest quarter. But Reitzes said HP seemed to be managing volatility in emerging markets far better than its peers, noting revenue in the Asia Pacific region grew 4 percent in the quarter. Growth in the region was helped by a contract to supply laptops to the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, which BMO Capital Markets valued at about $450 million. HP has not disclosed its value. Still, Evercore’s Cihra raised his rating to “equal-weight” from “underweight,” citing an improving balance sheet and a moderation in the decline of its PC and printer businesses. Evercore raised its price target to $25 from $20. Among the nine other firms raising price targets, three increased to $30. Credit Suisse was the biggest mover, with an increase to $30 from $25. HP shares hit a 12-month high of $27.77 on Aug. 2. The stock hit its 12-month low of $12.22 in November last year.

443,IBM,HP shares set to open 6 pct higher after revenue surprise,"Nov 27 (Reuters) - Signs that Hewlett-Packard Co’s  turnaround plan is finally yielding results prompted at least one brokerage to raise its rating on HP shares and eight others to raise price targets, setting up the stock for a bounce on Wednesday. Expectations were low for HP’s fourth quarter following a disappointing third quarter and after rivals IBM and Cisco Systems Inc reported poor results. But HP surprised on Tuesday by reporting stronger-than-expected revenue due to growth in its enterprise group, which supplies servers, storage and networking products to business.

444,IBM,UPDATE 4-HP enterprise sales pickup stirs turnaround hopes,"(Adds comments on China business in paragraphs 14-18) By Poornima Gupta SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co  beat revenue forecasts as sales growth in its enterprise group inspired cautious optimism about the company’s turnaround plan, and its shares rallied more than 7 percent. Revenue from the sprawling enterprise group, which Chief Executive Meg Whitman is focused on expanding as personal computer sales crumble globally, climbed 2 percent, aided by a 10 percent rise in server sales and 3 percent growth of the networking business. Wall Street had low expectations for HP following a disappointing third-quarter performance, and after rivals such as International Business Machines Corp and Cisco Systems Inc had reported poor results. The pickup in enterprise hardware revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter - coming after a 9 percent slide in sales from the same division in the previous three months - helped shore up confidence in Whitman’s turnaround effort. “I saw better-than-expected performance out of the enterprise group, which we expected to be weak given the results from peers such as IBM and Cisco,” said Edward Jones technology analyst Bill Kreher. “There is some hope, given that the company was able to jump over what was admittedly a pretty low hurdle.” He cautioned, though, that any signs of a turnaround will remain uneven. But the company’s operating margins eroded. Non-GAAP operating margin slipped to 9 percent in the quarter from 10.4 percent a year earlier, reflecting aggressive competition from rivals such as Dell Inc and Lenovo Inc. Whitman, who took the helm of the world’s largest PC maker more than a year ago, is trying to wean the Silicon Valley icon off sales of personal computers. Last month, she told Wall Street she expects revenue to stabilize in 2014, with some areas of growth for the company. With the help of job cuts and expansion into markets and areas with longer-term potential such as enterprise computing services, the CEO is trying to revive growth. Shares in HP climbed above $27 in extended trading, from a close of $25.09 on the New York Stock Exchange. Revenue fell across most of HP’s business divisions except the enterprise group, whose sales edged up to $7.6 billion. Sales from HP’s largest, PC-focused unit slipped 2 percent to $8.58 billion while the printing division’s sales dipped 1 percent to $6.04 billion. In August, Whitman replaced the head of its enterprise group Dave Donatelli with Bill Veghte who had joined HP from Microsoft. At the time, she primarily blamed poor execution by the division for a disappointing fiscal third-quarter result. On Tuesday, Whitman sounded a more upbeat note for HP’s second-largest division by sales. “We have more to do on the margins but we are happy,” Whitman said in an interview. “We had a good quarter in networking, particularly in China and in Europe.” HP faced an aggressive pricing environment and a tough global economy but there were “some bright spots in Asia and in some of our emerging markets,” she added. The company’s performance in China is in stark contrast to the warning of weakness in the region from rival Cisco and  sales declines for IBM. Although Whitman said some of HP’s other businesses didn’t perform as well there as networking and noted the Chinese economy remained uncertain, she added that HP’s renewed focus on the region will help mitigate some of the softness there. HP recently appointed telecommunications veteran Robert Mao as chairman for its China region. Overall, the company posted revenue of $29.1 billion, beating the $27.9 billion expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Non-GAAP net earnings fell 14 percent to $2 billion in the quarter or $1.01 per share, versus the $1.00 analysts had expected on average. Looking forward, HP said it expects non-GAAP earnings per share of 82 to 86 cents for its fiscal first quarter, with the top end coming in slightly higher than 85 cents expected by Wall Street analysts.

447,IBM,Lawsuit accuses IBM of hiding China risks amid NSA spy scandal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM Corp has been sued by a shareholder who accused it of concealing how its ties to what became a major U.S. spying scandal reduced business in China and ultimately caused its market value to plunge more than $12 billion. IBM lobbied Congress hard to pass a law letting it share personal data of customers in China and elsewhere with the U.S. National Security Agency, in a bid to protect its intellectual property rights, according to a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan. The plaintiff in the complaint, Louisiana Sheriffs’ Pension & Relief Fund, said this threatened IBM hardware sales in China, particularly given a program known as Prism that let the NSA spy on that country through technology companies such as IBM. The Baton Rouge pension fund said the revelation of Prism and related disclosures by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden caused Chinese businesses and China’s government to abruptly cut ties with the world’s largest technology services provider. It said this led IBM on October 16 to post disappointing third-quarter results, including drops in China of 22 percent in sales and 40 percent in hardware sales. While quarterly profit rose 6 percent, revenue dropped 4 percent and fell well below analyst forecasts. IBM shares fell 6.4 percent on October 17, wiping out $12.9 billion of the Armonk, New York-based company’s market value. The lawsuit names IBM, Chief Executive Virginia Rometty and Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge as defendants, and says they should be held liable for the company’s failure to reveal the risks of its lobbying and its NSA ties sooner. IBM spokesman Doug Shelton did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Louisiana fund is represented by Bernstein, Litowitz, Berger & Grossmann, a prominent class-action specialist. It seeks class-action status on behalf of shareholders from June 25 to October 16, 2013, and damages for shareholder losses.

451,IBM,Ex-broker pleads guilty to insider trading over 2009 IBM deal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former stock broker pleaded guilty on Thursday to charges stemming from a conspiracy to engage in insider trading ahead of a 2009 acquisition by IBM Corp (IBM.N). David Weishaus, 33, told a federal judge in Manhattan that he had traded on a tip a friend got from his roommate that IBM had agreed to buy Chicago-based software company SPSS Inc before the $1.2 billion deal was publicly announced. “I know my conduct was wrong, and I apologize to the court and my family, especially my mother and father,” Weishaus said. The plea came amid a crackdown on insider trading by New York federal prosecutors, who since October 2009 have secured convictions of 78 people. On Wednesday a jury convicted Michael Steinberg, a portfolio manager at Steven A. Cohen’s SAC Capital Advisors accused of insider trading. Weishaus, whose case is unrelated to Steinberg’s, was first indicted in November 2012 and faced a January 21 trial date. He pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and one count of securities fraud. The plea is subject to a cooperation agreement. In a statement, Preet Bharara, the Manhattan U.S. attorney, said the investigation is continuing. The indictment mentions two unnamed co-conspirators who also traded ahead of the IBM deal. Weishaus, a former employee at Westport, Connecticut-based Euro Pacific Capital Inc, was the last of three individuals charged in connection with an insider trading scheme that prosecutors say netted them and others more than $1 million in profits. Prosecutors say the IBM deal details came from an associate at the New York law firm that represented the computer giant. While not named, Cravath Swaine & Moore has said it was IBM’s counsel in the deal. At Thursday’s hearing, Weishaus said that after a friend also working at his firm gave him the tip, he bought SPSS call options and made a profit following the deal’s announcement on July 28, 2009. Prosecutors say the friend was Thomas Conradt, who himself traded in SPSS ahead of the deal’s announcement based on tips from his roommate, Trent Martin, an Australian financial analyst. Condradt, like Weishaus, worked at Euro Pacific, while Martin at the time of the trading worked at Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc (RBS.L), according to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority records. Both Condradt and Martin earlier this year pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the insider trading probe. U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter set Weishaus’s sentencing for April 25.

453,IBM,U.S. judge dismisses apartheid claims against 2 German companies,"NEW YORK, Dec 26 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday said Daimler AG and Rheinmetall AG cannot be held liable for aiding and abetting South Africa’s former apartheid government in race-based attacks and injustices. U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin in New York said the German companies could not be sued under a 1789 law, the Alien Tort Statute, allowing non-U.S. citizens to bring cases in U.S. courts over violations of international law. Scheindlin said the plaintiffs failed to show that the facts of the case “touch and concern the United States with sufficient force” to justify the law’s use. She declined, however, to immediately dismiss related claims against two U.S. companies, Ford Motor Co and IBM Corp . Those companies had pushed for dismissal after a federal appeals court in August sent the case back to Scheindlin for a decision, while opining that the claims appeared “plainly barred” by a recent Supreme Court ruling. “I think this came as a shocker to Ford and IBM,” said Michael Hausfeld, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs included South Africans and family members who said they were victims of decades of race-based crimes, including torture and extrajudicial killings, perpetrated by the country’s security forces during apartheid. They accused Daimler, Ford, IBM and Rheinmetall of facilitating this activity by selling products such as cars and computers to the government. The defendants denied wrongdoing. Apartheid ended in 1994 when South Africa held its first all-race elections, bringing Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress to power. Mandela died Dec. 5. Robert Zimet, a lawyer for Rheinmettal, called the ruling “welcome news.” Representatives for the other defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Scheindlin’s order is the latest fallout from a U.S. Supreme Court decision that limited the ability of human rights plaintiffs to use the Alien Tort Statute to sue companies accused of improper collusion with foreign governments. That decision, in April, in a case against Royal Dutch Shell Plc by Nigerians accusing it of complicity in violent crack downs on protesters in the 1990s, was a victory for multi-national corporations that do business in the developing world. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority that there is a presumption against the extraterritorial application of the Alien Tort Statute. He said the law could apply if there is enough of a U.S. connection, but that it would “reach too far to say that mere corporate presence suffices.” The ruling had immediate ripple effects, causing some other Alien Tort Statute cases to be narrowed or dismissed. Scheindlin said it is “appropriate” to allow the plaintiffs to address the question of whether a corporation may be liable for a violation of the Alien Tort Statute. Scheindlin said if she determines that corporations may be liable under Alien Tort Statute, the plaintiffs can seek to file an amended complaint against the remaining defendants.

454,IBM,IBM to invest $1 billion to create new business unit for Watson,"(Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) said it will invest more than $1 billion to establish a new business unit for Watson, as the tech giant hopes to get more revenue from the supercomputer system that beat humans on the television quiz show “Jeopardy”. The world’s largest technology service provider said the IBM Watson Group will be headed by Michael Rhodin, who was previously senior vice president of IBM’s software solutions group. IBM said the investment includes a $100 million equity fund to boost innovation at its Watson Developers Cloud, which it opened up to external application developers last year. The unit will have about 2,000 employees and will be based in New York City. Watson, which beat expert “Jeopardy” quiz show contestants in 2011, is an artificial intelligence super computer system named after legendary International Business Machines President Thomas Watson. Using natural language capabilities and analytics, Watson processes information akin to how people think, allowing it to quickly analyze and interpret large amounts of data. IBM said it has shrunk Watson to the size of three stacked pizza boxes from its original size of a master bedroom. Under the Watson Group, IBM will offer the technology, which is delivered over the cloud and can power new consumer and enterprise apps, to businesses and industries as well as to consumers. IBM said it decided to establish the unit because of strong demand for cognitive computing. “We have reached the inflection point where the interest is overwhelming and we recognized we need to move faster,” said Stephen Gold, vice president of Watson Business. Watson will be deployed on Softlayer, the cloud computing infrastructure business IBM bought last year. Jamie Popkin, managing vice president at research firm Gartner, said IBM’s technology significantly improved how information can be used and managed. “I think they’ve developed something that takes us to the next step where information management needs to go,” said Popkin. According to Gartner, by next year there will likely be a large and growing market for Watson-derived smart advisors and it said that Crédit Agricole predicted that these systems will account for more than 12 percent of IBM’s total revenue in 2018.

463,IBM,IBM revenue misses Street hit by weak China demand,"(Reuters) - IBM, the world’s largest technology services company, reported quarterly revenue that missed estimates for the fourth straight quarter, due to a steep fall in demand for servers and storage products in emerging markets such as China. International Business Machines Corp shares fell 3.5 percent to $181.68 in after-hours trade. Chief Executive Ginni Rometty said she and her team would forego their annual incentive payments for 2013, as IBM failed to grow revenue, especially in growth markets such as China. Revenue in IBM’s hardware business, which includes server and storage products, fell for the ninth straight quarter as more companies switch to cloud computing services from traditional IT infrastructure. IBM’s revenue also took a hit in emerging economies as a backlash against U.S. government spying contributed to plummeting demand. Asia-Pacific revenue fell 16 percent, while that from Brazil, Russia, India and China fell 14 percent in the quarter. “Their growth markets were everything but growth,” Forrester analyst Andrew Bartels said. “They have had quite a bit of success with sales of hardware in these emerging markets, but these markets are not doing well. They’re facing competition in those markets,” Bartels said. IBM, however, forecast full-year 2014 adjusted profit that beat analysts’ expectations and also affirmed its 2015 target for operating earnings of at least $20 per share. Total revenue fell 5 percent to $27.7 billion in the fourth quarter ended December 31, missing analysts expectation of $28.25 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue from its system and technology unit, which includes servers and storage, fell 26.1 percent to $4.26 billion. Revenue from global technology services, its largest business, fell 3.6 percent to $9.92 billion. China accounts for about 5 percent of IBM’s business. About 40 percent of that business is hardware. IBM said China’s economic reforms enacted in November was affecting state-owned enterprises which formed a bulk of its business. “In view of the company’s overall full-year results, my senior team and I have recommended that we forgo our personal annual incentive payments for 2013,” Chief Executive Ginni Rometty said in a statement. For 2013, Rometty’s base pay was $1.5 million and annual incentive payment (AIP) target was $4 million. “She will not receive any of that AIP. So, in terms of these cash payments, about 75 percent of her cash pay was at risk, and she will not receive the at-risk portion,” IBM spokesman John Bukovinsky said in an email. Software revenue was the only bright spot growing 2.8 percent to $8.14 billion in the quarter. IBM and rivals such as Oracle and SAP are racing to meet surging demand for web-based software products, better known as cloud computing. Moving to cloud allows businesses to lower their costs by ditching bulky servers for network-based software and using remote data centers run by technology companies instead. The global cloud services market last year grew by almost a fifth to an estimated $131 billion, according to research firm Gartner. IBM Markets Intelligence estimates the market could be as big as $200 billion by 2020. IBM’s net income for the fourth quarter rose to $6.2 billion, or $5.73 a share, from $5.8 billion, or $5.13 per share a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, it earned $6.13 per share, above analysts’ estimates of $5.99 per share. The stock closed at $188.43 on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

468,IBM,Lenovo restarts talks to buy IBM server unit: source,"NEW YORK/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China’s Lenovo Group Ltd has resumed talks to buy International Business Machines Corp’s (IBM) low-end server unit, a source familiar with the matter said, a purchase that would bolster its efforts to diversify beyond a shrinking PC market. A deal for IBM’s x86 servers, which power corporate data centers, fits in with Lenovo’s attempts to remold itself as a growing force in mobile devices and data storage servers. It also helps IBM’s shift away from hardware towards software and services. The two companies failed to reach an agreement last year after differing on pricing. Media reports then put IBM’s hopes at between $4 billion to $6 billion for the unit, while Lenovo was said to be only willing to offer $2.5 billion. Analysts now estimate the sale of the IBM unit to Lenovo could be worth between $2.5 billion and $3 billion. That would make it the biggest ever deal in China’s IT sector, outpacing Badu Inc’s acquisition of 91 Wireless from NetDragon Websoft Inc for $1.85 billion last year. “Everybody wins because even if IBM could double the profitability it’s still not good enough for IBM. On the other hand, Lenovo doubling the server business margins is a good deal for Lenovo,” said Alberto Moel, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. Lenovo, the world’s biggest PC maker, said on Tuesday it was in preliminary talks about an acquisition. It declined to name the seller but said it was making the statement in response to reports about its potential acquisition of a server business. It added that it had not entered into any definitive agreement and that no material terms had been agreed to. An IBM spokesman said on Monday the company wouldn’t comment on the matter. Dell Inc, which went private in a $25 billion deal last year, has also been cited in media reports as a potential suitor for the business. A Beijing-based spokesman for Dell declined to comment. Lenovo’s purchase of IBM’s Thinkpad PC business in 2005 for $1.75 billion became the springboard for its leap to the top of global PC maker rankings. Moel, who estimates IBM’s low-end server business could be worth between $2.5 billion to $2.9 billion, said IBM was likely more eager now to do a deal than last year after several quarters of weak earnings. But any deal would also likely invite scrutiny from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) as servers were more directly related to data security than PCs and phones, he added. Lenovo could finance the deal through a combination of cash, debt and converts, said Nicolas Baratte, a Hong Kong-based analyst with brokerage CLSA. The company has $3 billion in cash, and very little debt, and IBM is a very willing seller, he added. “If IBM sells all its server business, except the top-end servers, the deal is worth $2.5 to $3 billion,” Baratte said. “There is no financing problem for $3 billion, but I don’t think it will be one hundred percent cash.” Shares in Lenovo, which has a market value of $13.7 billion, closed up 2.75 percent at HK$10.46 on Tuesday, while the benchmark Hong Kong share index was up 0.5 percent. Its shares have surged 12 percent this year, and earlier this month marked their highest level in more than 13 years after an IDC report showed it managed to boost PC shipments 9 percent in the fourth quarter while industry shipments slid 5.6 percent. IBM is due to report fourth-quarter earnings later on Tuesday. In the previous quarter, revenue missed expectations, hit by a 40 percent drop in China hardware sales.

471,IBM,UPDATE 3-Lenovo restarts talks to buy IBM server unit -source,"* Companies abandoned talks last year over pricing * Dell Inc also likely to be interested - media reports * IBM server unit value likely $2.5-$3 bln - analysts NEW YORK/HONG KONG, Jan 21 (Reuters) - China’s Lenovo Group Ltd has resumed talks to buy International Business Machines Corp’s (IBM) low-end server unit, a source familiar with the matter said, a purchase that would bolster its efforts to diversify beyond a shrinking PC market. A deal for IBM’s x86 servers, which power corporate data centers, fits in with Lenovo’s attempts to remould itself as a growing force in mobile devices and data storage servers. It also helps IBM’s shift away from hardware towards software and services. The two companies failed to reach an agreement last year after differing on pricing. Media reports then put IBM’s hopes at between $4 billion to $6 billion for the unit, while Lenovo was said to be only willing to offer $2.5 billion. Analysts now estimate the sale of the IBM unit to Lenovo could be worth between $2.5 billion and $3 billion. That would make it the biggest ever deal in China’s IT sector, outpacing Baidu Inc’s acquisition of 91 Wireless from NetDragon Websoft Inc for $1.85 billion last year. “Everybody wins because even if IBM could double the profitability it’s still not good enough for IBM. On the other hand, Lenovo doubling the server business margins is a good deal for Lenovo,” said Alberto Moel, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. Lenovo, the world’s biggest PC maker, said on Tuesday it was in preliminary talks about an acquisition. It declined to name the seller but said it was making the statement in response to reports about its potential acquisition of a server business. It added that it had not entered into any definitive agreement and that no material terms had been agreed to. An IBM spokesman said on Monday the company wouldn’t comment on the matter.

472,IBM,GLOBAL MARKETS-US stocks end mixed with focus on earnings; dlr firms,"* Poor IBM results weigh on S&P;, Dow * Treasury prices down on weaker German government debt * Dollar firms on bets over Fed stimulus cut * Sterling shines on expectations for UK rate hike By Barani Krishnan NEW YORK, Jan 22 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks finished flat to either side of unchanged on Wednesday as investors played off a mixed bag of company earnings, while the dollar firmed against most major currencies ahead of next week’s Federal Reserve meeting where another cut in stimulus is seen possible. Treasuries fell and benchmark yields edged up from five-week lows, with prices dragged down by weaker German government debt prices. On Wall Street, IBM missed revenue expectations for a fourth straight quarter, driving down shares of the world’s largest technology services company by nearly 4 percent, making them the biggest drag on the market. Shares of Coach Inc, the luxury handbag maker, also tumbled, stung by disappointing sales in North America. Even so, there were some bright spots, like United Technologies Corp and railroad company Norfolk Southern , both of which reported strong quarterly earnings. “We’ve seen significant decreases in a company’s ability to deliver on earnings this quarter ... however, we’ve also seen signs that the top-line growth we’ve been looking for is starting to emerge,” said Kristina Hooper, head of portfolio strategies at Allianz Global Investors in New York. “Seeing a broad-based top-line growth trend would really speak to the health of the economy ... that has allowed for the market to hang in there despite some disappointments.” The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 41.10 points, or 0.25 percent, at 16,373.34. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up 1.06 points, or 0.06 percent, at 1,844.86. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 17.24 points, or 0.41 percent, at 4,243.00. IBM lost 3.3 percent to $182.25, weighing on both the Dow and S&P; 500. The company was hit in the latest quarter by weakening demand, particularly in growth markets like China. Coach tumbled 6 percent to $49.28, the worst performer on the S&P; 500, on declining North American sales and market share in the handbag business to fast-growing rivals. Shares of United Technologies, the world’s largest maker of elevators and air conditioners, were up almost 1 percent at $116.12. The company reported higher fourth-quarter profit that topped Wall Street estimates, though revenue fell shy of expectations. Norfolk Southern posted a 24 percent rise in quarterly income, driving its shares up 4.8 percent to $92.94. The shares had risen more than 6 percent earlier, helping the Dow Jones Transportation average hit a record high. An upgrade of the International Monetary Fund’s world forecasts lifted sentiment in global equities. World stocks as measured by the MSCI world equity index  edged up 0.07 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst closed up 0.1 percent at 1,347.05, leaving it just shy of a multi-year high touched on Tuesday at 1,353.47. The euro zone’s blue-chip STOXX 50  shed 0.1 percent to 3,151.27 points. The dollar slipped against sterling and the Australian dollar while rising against others, as measured against a basket of currencies. Investors expect the Fed, when it meets next week, to make another $10 billion cut to its monthly bond-buying program after last month’s reduction brought its monthly purchases of bonds to $75 billion. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was down 11/32, with its yield at 2.8637 percent. The 10-year yield hit 2.818 percent on Friday, its lowest level since Dec. 11, according to Reuters data. Sterling hit a three-week high against the dollar and a one-year high against the euro. The pound rallied after a sharper-than-expected fall in UK unemployment, to 7.1 percent, provided fresh proof of a strengthening economy and bolstered speculation that a Bank of England rate increase may not be too far off. Minutes from the BoE’s last meeting, released at the same time as the data, showed policymakers now acknowledged unemployment was likely to fall to the 7 percent threshold they have set for reviewing the bank’s policy, “materially earlier” than expected. “It will certainly be the big challenge for Bank of England Governor Mark Carney and the (Monetary Policy Committee) in managing the forward guidance,” said Michael Hewson, chief strategist at CMC Markets. “What does he do when it does hit 7 percent? ... I think the only way is up for the pound.” Among commodities, oil climbed on expectations that accelerating growth in industrialized economies would lift demand. U.S. crude oil closed up almost 2 percent at $96.73 a barrel, its highest settlement for the year.",1222014,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-global/global-markets-us-stocks-end-mixed-with-focus-on-earnings-dlr-firms-idUSL2N0KW1WE20140122
473,IBM,Wall Street flat on earnings; IBM pressures Dow,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P; 500 closed flat on Wednesday as a mixed bag of corporate earnings failed to give investors the confidence to push equities higher with the index near record levels. For the second day in a row, the Dow posted outsized losses following weak results from one of its components while the Nasdaq climbed, with BlackBerry one of its biggest boosts. International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) lost 3.3 percent to $182.25, the biggest drag on the Dow after the tech giant missed revenue expectations for a fourth straight quarter amid weakening demand, particularly in growth markets like China. The results followed disappointments from Verizon (VZ.N), Travelers (TRV.N) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), which weighed on the blue-chip index on Tuesday. IBM’s decline offset modest gains from fellow component United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), which rose 1 percent to $116.12 after it reported fourth-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street estimates, although revenue was shy of expectations. “We’ve seen significant decreases in a company’s ability to deliver on earnings this quarter ... however, we’ve also seen signs that the top-line growth we’ve been looking for is starting to emerge,” said Kristina Hooper, head of portfolio strategies at Allianz Global Investors in New York. “Seeing a broad-based top-line growth trend would really speak to the health of the economy ... that’s allowed for the market to hang in there despite some disappointments.” With 16 percent of the S&P; 500 having reported, about 61 percent have topped profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, compared with the average of 67 percent over the past four quarters. More than 66 percent have topped revenue expectations, above the 55 percent average over that timeframe. About eight companies have issued negative outlooks for every positive one, which would mark the lowest ratio on record should it continue. After the market closed on Wednesday, Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) reported a rise in fourth-quarter earnings, helped by subscriber growth. Shares surged 17 percent in after-hours trading. Online auction site eBay Inc (EBAY.O) surged 11 percent to $60.44 after the bell following its results. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was down 41.10 points, or 0.25 percent, at 16,373.34. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX was up 1.06 points, or 0.06 percent, at 1,844.86. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was up 17.24 points, or 0.41 percent, at 4,243.00. After a 29.6 percent jump in 2013, buoyed by the Federal Reserve’s massive stimulus, the S&P; 500 is down 0.2 percent this year as investors look to corporate profits to justify current prices. The index is 0.2 percent away from its all-time closing high. “In general, valuations are stretched, though there are still areas of opportunity for investors who are able to be more selective,” said Hooper, who helps oversee $436 billion in assets under management. “Focusing on areas with more growth may be worth paying up for.” Also in earnings, Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.N slumped 12 percent to $3.67 after forecasting a steeper-than-expected fall in current quarter revenue, while Coach Inc COH.N tumbled 6 percent to $49.38 as the S&P;’s worst performer after it said sales in North America fell further in the final quarter of 2013. On the upside, Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC.N) jumped 4.8 percent to $92.94 after its earnings beat expectations, helping lift the Dow Jones Transportation average .DJT to a record high. Nuance Communications (NUAN.O) rose 7.8 percent to $16.05 after giving a first-quarter outlook, helping to boost the Nasdaq. U.S.-listed shares of BlackBerry BBRY.O also buoyed the tech-heavy index, jumping 8.6 percent to $10.78. Shares of the smartphone maker are up about 26 percent over the past three sessions. About 62 percent of companies traded on the New York Stock Exchange closed higher while 55 percent of Nasdaq-listed shares ended in positive territory. About 6.23 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data.

While the Nasdaq advanced, the Dow fell for a second straight day, again pressured by weak results from one of its components. International Business Machines Corp lost 3.5 percent to $181.88, the biggest drag on both the Dow and S&P; 500, after the tech giant missed revenue expectations for a fourth straight quarter amid weakening demand, particularly in growth markets like China. The results followed similar disappointments from Verizon , Travelers and Johnson & Johnson, which weighed on the Dow on Tuesday. IBM’s decline offset modest gains from fellow component United Technologies Corp, which rose 0.6 percent to $115.68 after it reported fourth-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street estimates, although revenue fell shy of expectations. “We’ve seen significant decreases in a company’s ability to deliver on earnings this quarter... however, we’ve also seen signs that the top-line growth we’ve been looking for is starting to emerge,” said Kristina Hooper, head of portfolio strategies at Allianz Global Investors in New York. “Seeing a broad-based top-line growth trend would really speak to the health of the economy... that’s allowed for the market to hang in there despite some disappointments.” With 16 percent of the S&P; 500 having reported, about 61 percent have topped profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, compared with the long-term average of 63 percent.

After a 29.6 percent jump in the S&P; 500 in 2013, buoyed by the Federal Reserve’s massive stimulus, the S&P; has shaved off a mere 0.2 percent so far in 2014 as investors look to corporate profits for evidence of growth as the Federal Reserve winds down its market-friendly bond purchases. “In general valuations are stretched, though there are still areas of opportunity for investors who are able to be more selective,” aid Hooper, who helps oversee $436 billion in assets under management. “Focusing on areas with more growth may be worth paying up for.” Also in earnings, Advanced Micro Devices Inc slumped 10.8 percent to $3.72 after forecasting a steeper-than-expected fall in current quarter revenue, while Coach Inc tumbled 6 percent to $49.38 as the S&P;’s worst performer after it said sales in North America fell further in the final quarter of 2013.

477,IBM,GLOBAL MARKETS-US stocks flat as earnings in focus; dollar steady,"* Poor IBM results weigh heavily on S&P;, Dow * Treasury prices down on weaker German govt debt * Dollar holds on bets over Fed stimulus cut * Sterling shines on expectations for UK rate hike By Barani Krishnan NEW YORK, Jan 22 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were little changed on Wednesday, as investors played off a mixed bag of company earnings, while the dollar held steady against most major currencies ahead of next week’s Federal Reserve meeting, where another cut in stimulus is seen possible. Treasuries prices fell and benchmark yields edged up from five-week lows, with prices dragged lower by weaker German government debt. On Wall Street, IBM missed revenue expectations for a fourth straight quarter, driving down shares of the world’s largest technology services company by nearly 4 percent, making them the biggest drag on the market. Shares of Coach Inc, the luxury handbag maker, also tumbled, stung by disappointing sales in North America. “There has been little so far to excite the masses and it is going to lead many to question. Can this market hang in there with a flat earnings environment?” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 36.92 points, or 0.22 percent, at 16,377.52. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up 1.34 points, or 0.07 percent, at 1,845.14. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 17.98 points, or 0.43 percent, at 4,243.74. IBM lost 3.3 percent to $182.22, weighing heavily on both the Dow and S&P; 500. The company was hit in the latest quarter by weakening demand, particularly in growth markets like China. Coach tumbled 7 percent to $48.86, the worst performer on the S&P; 500, on declining North American sales and market share in the handbag business to fast-growing rivals. On the upside, both United Technologies Corp and railroad company Norfolk Southern reported strong quarterly earnings. Shares of United Technologies, the world’s largest maker of elevators and air conditioners, were up 0.8 percent at $115.92. The company reported higher fourth-quarter profit that topped Wall Street estimates, though revenue fell shy of expectations. Norfolk Southern posted a 24 percent rise in quarterly income, driving its shares up 4.4 percent at $92.61. The shares had risen more than 6 percent earlier, helping the Dow Jones Transportation average hit a record high. An upgrade of the International Monetary Fund’s world forecasts lifted sentiment in global equities, keeping world stocks steady.. World stocks as measured by the MSCI world equity index .MIWD00000PUS> edged up 0.07 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst closed up 0.1 percent at 1,347.05, leaving it just shy of a multi-year high touched on Tuesday at 1,353.47. The euro zone’s blue-chip STOXX 50  shed 0.1 percent to 3,151.27 points. The dollar slipped against sterling and the Australian dollar while holding against other major currencies, as measured against a basket of currencies. Investors expect the Fed, when it meets on Monday and Tuesday, to make another $10 billion cut to its monthly bond-buying program after last month’s reduction brought its monthly purchases of bonds to $75 billion. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was down 9/32, with the yield at 2.8563 percent. The 10-year yield hit 2.818 percent on Friday, its lowest level since Dec. 11, according to Reuters data. Sterling hit a three-week high against the dollar and a one-year high against the euro. The pound rallied after a sharper-than-expected fall in UK unemployment, to 7.1 percent, provided fresh proof of a strengthening economy and bolstered speculation that a Bank of England rate increase may not be too far off. Minutes from the BoE’s last meeting, released at the same time as the data, showed policymakers now acknowledged unemployment was likely to fall to the 7 percent threshold they have set for reviewing the bank’s policy, “materially earlier” than expected. “It will certainly be the big challenge for Bank of England Governor Mark Carney and the (Monetary Policy Committee) in managing the forward guidance,” said Michael Hewson, chief strategist at CMC Markets. “What does he do when it does hit 7 percent? ... I think the only way is up for the pound.” Among commodities, oil climbed on expectations that accelerating growth in industrialized economies would lift demand. U.S. crude oil futures rose almost 2 percent to $96.77 a barrel, its highest since Jan. 2.",1222014,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-global/global-markets-us-stocks-flat-as-earnings-in-focus-dollar-steady-idUSL2N0KW1A520140122

480,IBM,IBM shares open down 5 percent after weak results,"(Reuters) - Shares in IBM Corp opened down about 5 percent on Wednesday, a day after it missed revenue expectations, hurt by weak demand for its servers and storage equipment, particularly in growth markets such as China. Barclays and JPMorgan also said it would be an uphill task for IBM to meet its operating earnings forecast for 2014 and 2015 without the help of taxes and gains. “With the end of the mainframe cycle and weakness in emerging markets, coupled with pressure from cloud, revenue should remain pressured,” Barclays analysts wrote in a note to clients. IBM and rivals such as Oracle and SAP are racing to meet surging demand for web-based software products, better known as cloud computing. IBM on Tuesday forecast that full-year 2014 adjusted profit would beat analysts’ expectations and also affirmed its 2015 target for operating EPS of at least $20 per share. Barclays lowered its price target to $173 from $180 while JPMorgan cut its price target to $175 from $179. IBM’s shares were trading down 3.5 percent at $181.73 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after closing at $188.43 on Tuesday.

IBM shares lost 3.3 percent to $182.24 and were the biggest drag on both the Dow and S&P; 500 indexes. The world’s biggest technology services company missed revenue expectations for a fourth straight quarter amid weakening demand, particularly in growth markets like China. But fellow Dow component United Technologies Corp  was a bright spot, up 0.9 percent to $116.01 to help curb declines on the blue-chip index. The world’s largest maker of elevators and air conditioners reported fourth-quarter profit that topped Wall Street estimates, although revenue fell shy of expectations. Norfolk Southern Corp jumped 6.4 percent to $94.39 as one of the best performers on the S&P; 500. The railroad posted a 24 percent rise in quarterly income that beat Wall Street expectations. The gains helped lift the Dow Jones Transportation average to a record high. Coach Inc tumbled 6 percent to $49.38, making it the worst performer on the S&P; 500 after it said sales in North America fell further in the final quarter of 2013, as it lost share in the handbag business to fast-growing rivals. “There has been little so far to excite the masses and it is going to lead many to question, can this market hang in there with a flat earnings environment,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. “It will be easier to unnerve a market with less earnings confidence, and you are seeing companies like IBM and Coach that have come out and leave the investor looking for something substantial to bite into.” The Dow Jones industrial average fell 30.35 points or 0.18 percent, to 16,384.09, the S&P; 500 gained 1.05 points or 0.06 percent, to 1,844.85 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 9.179 points or 0.22 percent, to 4,234.939. After a 29.6 percent jump in the S&P; 500 in 2013, the S&P; has edged down 0.2 percent so far in 2014 as investors look to corporate profits for evidence of growth as the Federal Reserve has begun to wind down its market-friendly economic stimulus. About eight companies have issued negative outlooks for every positive one, which would mark the lowest ratio on record should it continue. According to Thomson Reuters data, earnings for the fourth quarter are expected to grow 7.1 percent over the prior year. Of the 65 companies in the benchmark S&P; index reporting through Tuesday, about 58 percent topped analyst expectations, below the long-term average of 63 percent. About 71 percent have topped revenue forecasts, above the long-term average of 61 percent. Advanced Micro Devices Inc slumped 10.8 percent to $3.72. The chipmaker forecast a steeper-than-expected fall in current quarter revenue, saying sales of gaming consoles were not growing fast enough to offset slowing PC sales. After the closing bell, earnings are expected from eBay Inc , Netflix Inc, Varian Medical Systems Inc  and F5 Networks Inc. A total of 26 S&P; 500 companies are scheduled to report earnings on Wednesday. Merger and acquisition activity continued at a brisk pace, as companies flush with cash look for ways to create growth.

482,IBM,Lenovo to buy IBM's low-end server unit for $2.3 billion,"(Reuters) - Chinese PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd has agreed to buy International Business Machine Corp’s low-end server business for $2.3 billion in what would be China’s biggest technology deal. The long-expected acquisition comes nearly a decade after Lenovo bought IBM’s money-losing ThinkPad business for $1.75 billion, eventually becoming the world leader in personal computers in 2012. The sale of the low-end server operation - which still needs U.S. government approval - would allow IBM to focus on its decade-long shift to more profitable software and services. The deal would increase Lenovo’s share in the server market to 14 percent from 2 percent, said Peter Hortensius, a senior vice-president at Lenovo. The deal needs clearance from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which protects U.S. national security. Chinese companies faced the most scrutiny over their U.S. acquisitions in 2012, according to a CFIUS report issued in December. Lenovo’s purchase of IBM’s notebook division faced scrutiny before approval, and this time will be easier, analysts said. “It’s fair to say that this deal is more likely to get through CFIUS without major problems than the 2005 transaction,” said John Reynolds, a partner at law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell in Washington, D.C. who has handled CFIUS issues for 20 years. Reynolds saw relatively little national security risk in the deal, noting that Lenovo was well-known in the United States. Maybank Kim Eng analyst Warren Lau noted that the System X server, among the systems to be bought by Lenovo, is based on commoditized technology and components from the United States. This deal is likely also to win U.S. antitrust approval, perhaps within weeks, said Jonathan Lewis, an antitrust partner with Baker & Hostetler LLP. “Given that Lenovo is likely to take advantage of its lower-cost manufacturing base in China, this deal is likely to be viewed as pro-competitive.” IBM shares edged 0.2 percent lower to $182.27 at mid-afternoon Thursday. Trading in Lenovo shares was halted before the close in Hong Kong ahead of the announcement. The deal with Lenovo marks another step in IBM’s switch away from hardware to software and services. IBM said this month it would spend more than $1.2 billion to build up to 15 data centers on five continents to expand its cloud services and reach new clients and markets. The company also said it would invest more than $1 billion to establish a new business unit for Watson - the supercomputer system that beat humans on the TV quiz show “Jeopardy” - to offer cloud services to businesses and consumers. With Lenovo’s PC business under siege from powerful smartphones and super-fast tablets, the company is remodeling itself as a force in mobile devices and data storage servers. It would not be easy for Lenovo turn around the server unit, however. IBM’s low-margin server business has posted seven quarters of losses as clients move to the cloud. “To generate costs synergy, Lenovo will need to move most of the manufacturing from IBM’s existing facility in Virginia to Asia while keeping some R&D; in the U.S.,” Lau said. The server business being sold by IBM, which produced low-cost x86 servers, competes with Hewlett-Packard Co and Dell but lags both in market share. IBM dominates the higher-end server market with a 57 percent share, according to research firm Canalys. IBM will retain its higher-margin server systems and continue to develop software and applications for the x86 platform. Following closure of the deal, Lenovo will offer jobs to 7,500 IBM employees and assume customer service and maintenance operations. “We will do a variety of things - improve products, drive improved costs, and couple it with the scale we have and our PC business to improve go-to-market,” said Lenovo’s Hortensius. Analysts said Lenovo would likely find it easier than IBM to sell the x86 servers to Chinese companies as Beijing tries to localize its IT purchases in the wake of revelations about widespread U.S. electronic snooping. Lenovo said it expected demand for computing power and recovery of global enterprise spending to further drive growth in the x86 server market. Lenovo has agreed to pay $2.07 billion in cash and the rest with stock of the Hong Kong-listed PC maker. The deal surpasses Baidu Inc’s $1.85 billion acquisition of 91 Wireless from NetDragon Websoft Inc last year, according to Thomson Reuters data, and underscores the clout of China’s technology firms as they expand overseas. The unit posted a loss of $26.4 million after tax for the 12 months ended December 31, compared with a profit of $187 million in the 12 months ended March 2013. The x86 unit has annual revenue of $4.6 billion. Talks between IBM and Lenovo fell apart last year due to differences over pricing, with media reports at the time suggesting IBM wanted as much as $6 billion for the unit. Analysts said the sale may have been accelerated by IBM’s problems in China following revelations of U.S. electronic spying and ongoing weakness in hardware sales. The world’s biggest technology services company posted a 23 percent drop in fourth-quarter revenue from China. Lenovo’s purchase of IBM’s PC business in 2005 became the springboard for its leap to the top of global PC maker rankings, and the market is betting Lenovo will enjoy similar success with its latest acquisition, which is partly reflected in a 9.44 percent rise in its shares this year. The Hang Seng stock index is down 2.5 percent in the same period. IBM’s server business is the world’s second-largest, with a 22.9 percent share of the $12.3 billion market in the third quarter of 2013, according to technology research firm Gartner. Hewlett-Packard is the biggest player, while Lenovo does not appear in the top five. Lenovo said it was advised by Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs Group.

The long-awaited acquisition comes nearly a decade after Lenovo bought IBM’s loss-making ThinkPad business for $1.75 billion, eventually becoming the world leader in personal computers in 2012. The sale of the low-end server operation - which still needs U.S. government approval - would allow International Business Machines (IBM) to focus on its decade-long shift to more profitable software and services. For Lenovo, the deal would increase its market share in the server market to 14 percent from 2 percent, said Peter Hortensius, senior vice-president at Lenovo and president of its Think Business Group. The deal still needs clearance from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a body charged with protecting U.S. national security interests. Chinese companies faced the most scrutiny over their U.S. acquisitions in 2012, according to a CFIUS report issued in December. Lenovo’s purchase of IBM’s notebook division faced similar scrutiny before getting the go-ahead. This time is likely to be easier, analysts said. “It’s fair to say that this deal is more likely to get through CFIUS without major problems than the 2005 transaction,” said John Reynolds, a partner at law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell in Washington, D.C. who has 20 years of experience dealing with CFIUS. Reynolds said there seemed to be relatively little national security risk in the deal, adding that Lenovo was now a fairly well-known corporate citizen compared with 2005. ISI Group analyst Brian Marshall also said he did not anticipate significant regulatory hurdles in the United States or China. “...Our seasoned China analyst believes the Chinese government is likely pleased with the deal,” he added. Maybank Kim Eng analyst Warren Lau noted that the System X server, among the systems to be bought by Lenovo, is based on commoditized technology and components that are sourced from the United States. IBM shares were slightly higher at $182.98 in early trading on Thursday. Trading in Lenovo shares was halted before the close in Hong Kong ahead of the announcement. The deal with Lenovo marks another step in IBM’s switch away from hardware to software and services. IBM said this month it would spend more than $1.2 billion to build up to 15 data centers on five continents to expand its cloud services and reach new clients and markets. The company also said it would invest more than $1 billion to establish a new business unit for Watson - the supercomputer system that beat humans on the TV quiz show “Jeopardy” - to offer the cloud services to businesses and consumers. With Lenovo’s PC business under siege from powerful smartphones and super-fast tablets, the company is diversifying its revenue and remodelling itself as a force in mobile devices and data storage servers. Lenovo would have its work cut out for it to turn around the server unit, however. IBM’s low-margin server business has posted seven quarters of losses as more clients switch to cloud storage from traditional infrastructure. “To generate costs synergy, Lenovo will need to move most of the manufacturing from IBM’s existing facility in Virginia to Asia while keeping some R&D; in the U.S.,” Lau said. The server business being sold by IBM, which produced low-cost x86 servers, competes Hewlett-Packard Co and Dell but lags both in market share. IBM dominates the higher-end server market with a 57 percent market-share, according to research firm Canalys. IBM will retain its higher-margin server systems and will continue to develop software and applications for the x86 platform. Following closure of the deal, Lenovo will offer jobs to 7,500 IBM employees around the world and assume customer service and maintenance operations. “We will do a variety of things - improve products, drive improved costs, and couple it with the scale we have and our PC business to improve go-to-market,” Hortensius said. Analysts said Lenovo would likely find it easier than IBM to sell the x86 servers to Chinese companies as Beijing tries to localize its IT purchases in the wake of revelations about widespread U.S. electronic snooping. ISI’s Marshall said the deal, if approved, would put more pressure on the server market as Lenovo may be less disciplined on pricing than IBM as tries to build market share. Lenovo said it expected demand for computing power and recovery of global enterprise spending to further drive growth in the x86 server market. Lenovo has agreed to pay $2.07 billion in cash and the rest with stock of the Hong Kong-listed PC maker. The deal surpasses Baidu Inc’s $1.85 billion acquisition of 91 Wireless from NetDragon Websoft Inc  last year, according to Thomson Reuters data, and underscores the growing clout of China’s technology firms as they look to expand overseas. The unit posted a loss of $26.4 million after tax for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $187 million in the 12 months ended March 2013. The x86 unit has annual revenue of $4.6 billion. Talks between IBM and Lenovo fell apart last year due to differences over pricing, with media reports at the time suggesting IBM wanted as much as $6 billion for the unit. Analysts said the sale may have been accelerated by IBM’s  problems in China following revelations of U.S. electronic spying and ongoing weakness in hardware sales. The world’s biggest technology services company reported a 23 percent drop in fourth-quarter revenue from China. Lenovo’s purchase of IBM’s PC business in 2005 became the springboard for its leap to the top of global PC maker rankings, and the market is betting Lenovo will enjoy similar success with its latest acquisition, which is partly reflected in a 9.44 percent rise in its shares this year. The Hang Seng stock index is down 2.5 percent in the same period. IBM’s server business is the world’s second-largest, with a 22.9 percent share of the $12.3 billion market in the third quarter of 2013, according to technology research firm Gartner. Hewlett-Packard Co is the biggest player, while Lenovo does not appear in the top five. “The acquisition presents a unique opportunity for the company to gain immediate scale and credibility in this market,” Lenovo said in a statement on Thursday. Lenovo said it was advised by Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs Group.

The acquisition comes nearly a decade after Beijing-based Lenovo bought International Business Machines’s (IBM) loss-making ThinkPad business for $1.75 billion, eventually becoming the world leader in personal computers in 2012. But with the PC business now under siege in the face of powerful smartphones and super-fast tablets, Lenovo is diversifying its revenue and remodelling itself as a force in mobile devices and data storage servers. The acquisition of the IBM unit, still subject to approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), would lift Lenovo’s market share in the server market to 14 percent from 2 percent currently, said Peter Hortensius, senior vice-president at Lenovo and president of its Think Business Group. Before that happens, Lenovo has to turn the server unit around. The low-margin business - which sells less powerful and slower x86 servers than IBM’s other higher-margin offerings - has posted seven quarters of losses as more clients switch to cloud storage from traditional infrastructure. “We will do a variety of things, improve products, drive improved costs, and couple it with the scale we have and our PC business to improve go-to-market,” Hortensius told Reuters on Thursday after the deal was announced. Analysts say Lenovo will likely find it easier than IBM to sell the x86 servers to Chinese companies as Beijing tries to localise its IT purchases in the wake of revelations about U.S. surveillance. Lenovo said it expects demand for computing power and recovery of global enterprise spending to further drive growth in the x86 server market. Lenovo has agreed to pay $2.07 billion in cash and the rest with stock of the Hong Kong-listed PC maker, in a deal set to be China’s biggest-ever technology M&A.; The deal surpasses Baidu Inc’s $1.85 billion acquisition of 91 Wireless from NetDragon Websoft Inc  last year, according to Thomson Reuters data, and underscores the growing clout of the country’s technology firms as they look to expand overseas. For IBM, the sale allows the company to focus on its decade-long shift to more profitable software and services. “What the business is worth to IBM is no longer relevant. The only thing that matters is what it’s worth to Lenovo,” said Alberto Moel, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. “If Lenovo can improve the margins... that could offset any continued revenue shrinkage.” The unit posted a $26.4 million loss after tax for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, compared with a $187 million profit in the 12 months ended March 2013. The x86 unit has annual revenues of $4.6 billion, Lenovo told Reuters.

The timing of the deal was uncertain, with one of the people saying an announcement could come as early as Thursday. The final price could be close the bottom end of the range, the person said. Lenovo, the world’s biggest PC maker, halted trading in its shares pending an announcement in respect of a transaction. . The potential deal comes after IBM missed revenue expectations for the fourth consecutive quarter when it reported earnings earlier this week. A deal for IBM’s x86 servers, which power corporate data centers, fits with Lenovo’s attempts to remould itself as a force in mobile devices and data storage servers. It also helps IBM’s shift away from hardware towards software and services. Reuters had reported on Tuesday that Lenovo had resumed talks to buy the IBM’s lower-margin unit after failing to reach an agreement last year following differences on pricing. Lenovo’s purchase of IBM’s Thinkpad PC business in 2005 for $1.75 billion became the springboard for its leap to the top of global PC maker rankings. Lenovo said earlier this week that it was in preliminary talks about an acquisition. It declined to name the seller but said it was making the statement in response to reports about its potential acquisition of a server business. Recent reports have also indicated that Fujitsu Ltd  and Dell Inc are also potentially interested in buying the server unit.

Hong Kong shares, however, extended the previous day’s weakness and fell to their lowest in more than two months as investors remained concerned over China’s economic recovery after a disappointing manufacturing survey on Thursday. By midday, the CSI300 of the largest Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings rose 1 percent. The Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.9 percent to its highest since Jan 8 at 2,059.51 points. They were up 3.5 and 2.7 percent for the week, respectively. If gains hold, this would be the first weekly gain in a month for Shanghai shares. The Hang Seng Index was down 0.7 percent to its lowest since Nov. 14 at 22,583.91 points, while the China Enterprises Index of the top Chinese listings in Hong Kong fell 0.5 percent. For the week, they are now down 2.4 and 1.1 percent, respectively. China’s central bank moved to head off another destabilising cash squeeze on Tuesday with a big injection of cash, bringing down money market rates, though some investors remain cautious. “There is some bargain hunting because valuations in the A-share market are pretty low,” said Ben Kwong, KSI Asia Ltd’s chief operating officer in Hong Kong. “Concerns about the relatively high interbank rate and further tightening of liquidity still linger, so funds were mainly interested in news-driven stocks,” Kwong said, adding that gains for the Shanghai index may be limited as investors take to the sidelines before the Lunar New Year holidays. Chinese property and financial counters led gains among industry groups. China Vanke, the country’s largest developer by sales, rose 4.5 percent in Shenzhen to a 3-week high, while rival Poly Real Estate gained 4 percent in Shanghai.

495,IBM,Experts predict Lenovo's U.S. buys will pass regulatory muster,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. officials are likely to allow China’s Lenovo Group to buy IBM’s low-end server business and Google Inc’s Motorola Mobility handset business if it agrees to concessions aimed at protecting U.S. national security, experts said. Computer maker Lenovo has advantages over other Chinese companies that should help it overcome the mutual suspicion between the United States and China over industrial spying and cybersecurity, such as its track record of successful U.S. acquisitions in the past. And importantly, it is not directly controlled by China’s government. Even so, it could be in for a battle over its latest deals with at least one lawmaker expressing concern. Lenovo said on Wednesday it would acquire Motorola Mobility, along with some 2,000 patents, for $2.91 billion. That news came days after an announcement the company would purchase IBM’s low-end server unit for $2.3 billion. The deals will be reviewed by the inter-agency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, to ensure they do not threaten national security. “We look forward to going through the regulatory process and we’re going to work with the regulators with an open and transparent approach,” Lenovo spokesman Brion Tingler said. Lenovo has been through the secretive CFIUS process three times before and has won approval each time, according to a source familiar with the process. The first was in 2005, when Lenovo bought IBM’s ThinkPad business in a deal that catapulted the company into the global technology big leagues. In that case CFIUS approval came to the dismay of Representative Frank Wolf, a Republican from Virginia and a tough critic of China. Wolf said he discovered after that approval that the State Department had made plans to purchase Lenovo computers. “They were not able to cancel the purchases but made sure that none of them were used for anything,” he said. “I just think we have to be careful,” said Wolf. Lenovo also went through CFIUS reviews when it bought Stoneware Inc to expand cloud solutions and formed a strategic partnership with EMC Corporation. Both deals were announced in 2012. It is not known what security concessions - if any - CFIUS wrung out of Lenovo in the previous transactions, but typical measures include having a security officer, a security plan or other steps aimed at preventing a foreign government from influencing a company in a way that would put U.S. security at risk, the expert said. CFIUS may also require that only U.S. citizens handle certain products and services or demand that certain products be located only in the United States. Lenovo has already been in touch with CFIUS about its latest U.S. deals, as is typical, said sources familiar with the process. A typical CFIUS analysis will touch on two sides - what threat may be posed by the foreign company involved and what vulnerabilities are exposed by the purchase, said Anne Salladin, a former Treasury official with CFIUS experience. “I do think that both of these deals are likely candidates for mitigation measures,” said Salladin, who is now at the law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan LLP. Another former government official with CFIUS experience, Jonathan Gafni, said the review of the Motorola Mobility deal likely would not focus on handsets but on more complicated patents. Lenovo will receive more than 2,000 “patent assets” as part of the transaction, the companies said, although it is not known which ones will change hands. Gafni said regulators would want to give them extra scrutiny. “There are already a ton of Chinese handsets being sold in this country,” said Gafni, now with Compass Point Analytics. “I think it could take some time to figure it all out, but I don’t see a big problem here.” In the end, experts said, Lenovo was likely to win CFIUS approval. “If there was a Chinese company that was well-positioned to see this deal come off, it’s Lenovo,” said Jim Lewis, a security expert with the think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies. “They’ve done the dance before and they know what the steps are.” CFIUS, which is headed by the Treasury Department, usually takes 30 days to review simple deals, but may take an additional 45 days on more complicated transactions. Of the 23 transactions CFIUS reviewed in 2012, 10 were withdrawn and abandoned, according to the latest CFIUS annual report. One Chinese transaction was blocked in 2012 - the proposed purchase of an Oregon wind farm near a sensitive Navy installation.

Gafni said regulators would want to give them extra scrutiny. “There are already a ton of Chinese handsets being sold in this country,” said Gafni, now with Compass Point Analytics. “I think it could take some time to figure it all out, but I don’t see a big problem here.” In the end, experts said, Lenovo was likely to win CFIUS approval. “If there was a Chinese company that was well-positioned to see this deal come off, it’s Lenovo,” said Jim Lewis, a security expert with the think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies. “They’ve done the dance before and they know what the steps are.” CFIUS, which is headed by the Treasury Department, usually takes 30 days to review simple deals, but may take an additional 45 days on more complicated transactions. Of the 23 transactions CFIUS reviewed in 2012, 10 were withdrawn and abandoned, according to the latest CFIUS annual report. One Chinese transaction was blocked in 2012 - the proposed purchase of an Oregon wind farm near a sensitive Navy installation.

499,IBM,IBM starts rolling out Watson supercomputer in Africa,"LAGOS (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) began rolling out its Watson supercomputer system across Africa on Thursday, saying it would help to address continental development obstacles as diverse as medical diagnoses, economic data collection and e-commerce research. The world’s biggest technology service provider said “Project Lucy” would take 10 years and cost $100 million. The undertaking was named after the earliest known human ancestor fossil, which was found in east Africa, “I believe it will spur a whole era of innovation for entrepreneurs here,” IBM Chief Executive Ginni Rometty told delegates at a conference on Wednesday. “Data ... needs to be refined. It will determine undisputed winners and losers across every industry,” she said. As an example, Rometty cited how Morocco had used sophisticated data mining for “smart agriculture” to improve how crops are grown by predicting weather, demand and disease outbreaks. The Watson system uses artificial intelligence that can quickly analyze huge amounts of data and understand human language well enough to hold sophisticated conversations. It beat humans on the TV quiz show “Jeopardy” in 2011. International Business Machines Corp has so far failed to convert that genius into substantial revenue growth, with the system contributing just $100 million over the past three years as overall revenues declined. The company said last month it would invest $1 billion in creating a business unit for Watson, named after former IBM President Thomas Watson. The technology would enable poorer parts of Africa to “leapfrog” stages of development they have failed to reach because they were too expensive, in much the same way mobile phones took off across the continent in places where there had been virtually no landlines, said Michel Bézy, a Rwanda-based technology professor who helped develop the Watson system. It could help with education in schools that have few computer resources by using smartphone apps that get access to Watson’s analytical tools through cloud computing, IBM’s chief Africa research scientist Uyi Stewart told Reuters in Lagos. “This is a continent with a tremendous infrastructural deficit, but leveraging data can help you get around it,” he said. Roads in countries like Nigeria are often so poorly maintained, traffic-clogged or flooded that it is impossible to predict how long a journey will take, which is problematic for logistics companies. Stewart said the system would help such companies by telling them where potholes are, which junctions are choke points and whether it is raining. Two Nigerian start ups, a logistics and a traffic control company, have already adopted the Watson system.

503,IBM,IBM's CEO visits China for trust-building talks with govt leaders: sources,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A slide in IBM Corp’s (IBM.N) sales in China amid a broad backlash against claims of U.S. government spying has triggered a rare visit to Beijing by Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty. The head of the world’s biggest technology services company arrives in China’s capital on Wednesday for three days of meetings with government leaders, according to people familiar with her visit. The visit comes as U.S. firms like IBM and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) seek to restore trust with Chinese regulators and reverse slumping sales. Beijing has encouraged state-owned companies to buy China-branded products since last year’s revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden of spying. That has undercut business at some U.S.-based multinationals operating in the world’s second-biggest economy. In Beijing, Rometty will have meetings with Chinese officials including Vice Premier Wang Yang, responsible for helping to formulate China’s economic policy. The IBM chief also is expected to meet officials from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and top state-backed customers. The precise agenda for the meetings couldn’t be ascertained immediately. “IBM doesn’t talk about or confirm our executives’ travel plans,” said New York-based company spokesman Edward Barbini. Though IBM books only about 5 percent of its sales in China, it has been operating there for 30 years, tapping into the country’s rise as an economic power. China sales fell more than 20 percent over the second half of last year, dragging down the company’s emerging markets business overall. It’s an unwelcome distraction for the Armonk, N.Y.-based firm as it continues to embrace higher-margin software and technology services while moving away from hardware. Last month, IBM agreed to sell its low-end server business to Lenovo Group Ltd. (0992.HK), the Chinese firm that acquired IBM’s ThinkPad business nearly a decade earlier. The $2.3 billion deal was struck at about one-half the reported asking price a year earlier, after the low-margin server business posted seven quarters of losses as clients moved to cloud computing. Rometty is the second top IBM executive to travel to Beijing in the last four months to meet Chinese officials. In November, IBM dispatched its head of governmental programs, Christopher Padilla, the former Under Secretary for International Trade at the U.S. Commerce Department, following announcement of the company’s third-quarter earnings. Padilla met with Wang Chao, China’s Vice Minister for Commerce, along with officials from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, according to people familiar with his visit. Rometty, in her meetings, is expected to emphasize the tech giant’s commitment to local partnerships, future cooperation, and information security. In the aftermath of Snowden’s revelations, U.S. technology companies, including IBM, “face an uphill battle proving their equipment is not compromised”, A.M. Sacconaghi of Bernstein Research wrote last month. The U.S. cloud computing industry alone may lose as much as $35 billion in worldwide sales over the next three years, according to estimates by the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based non-profit think-tank. In December, Louisiana Sheriffs’ Pension & Relief Fund sued IBM at U.S. District Court in Manhattan, accusing the firm of concealing how the U.S. spying scandal would reduce its China business. IBM had lobbied Congress to pass legislation allowing it to share personal data of customers in China and elsewhere with the NSA, the lawsuit claimed. “These allegations are ludicrous and irresponsible and IBM will vigorously defend itself in court,” IBM spokesman Doug Shelton said in an e-mail. In China, IBM is uncharacteristically reliant on hardware sales, primarily to state-owned enterprises. While sales of mainframe computers, servers, and storage account for about 15 percent of IBM’s worldwide revenue, in China hardware comprises 40 percent of local revenue. “China is going through a very significant economic set of reform,” IBM’s chief financial official Martin Schroeter told analysts on the company’s earnings call last month. “While there is more clarity on the overall plan, we continue to believe that it will take some time for our business in China to improve,” he said.

505,IBM,Cisco results to reflect sales slump; investors brace for more bad news,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors who were shocked by Cisco Systems Inc’s dire financial outlook in its last quarterly earnings report are bracing for more bad news when the network equipment maker reports results on Wednesday. Cisco warned on November 13 that revenue would decline as much as 10 percent in its second fiscal quarter ended in January and that it would not resume growth for several quarters. It blamed weak demand in emerging markets and from service provider customers as well as a backlash against U.S. government spying in China. Now, investors may face more gloomy predictions when the company reports fiscal second-quarter results after the market closes on Wednesday, according to analysts. “Expectations are pretty low. I think the company is not going to be upbeat,” said Raymond James analyst Simon Leopold. “They’ll meet expectations on earnings, they’ll tell us the environment is tough and that they’re working to restore their growth.” Leopold said that some investors had hoped that the company was being overly cautious when it issued its bleak financial targets in November. But with few signs of improvement from the broader market, Leopold said that any hopes of a quick turnaround have faded. “That seemingly conservative guidance seems pretty appropriate,” said Leopold, citing broader concerns about weakness in emerging markets and weak reports from other companies with exposure there. International Business Machines Corp, another U.S. technology bellwether with emerging markets exposure, missed its revenue expectations for the fourth quarter in a row in January, citing weakness in markets such as China. Wall Street on average expects Cisco to report earnings per share of 37 cents on revenue of $11.027 billion for its fiscal second quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Brian Marshall said Cisco’s woes could reach a trough in its fiscal third quarter but added that its “outlook remains uncertain.” “We expect emerging market demand to remain challenged in the near-term and the service provider weakness appears to be more of a Cisco-specific issue,” White said. The average analyst estimate is for fiscal third quarter revenue of $11.34 billion, which represents a slight sequential increase but a big decline from the year-ago revenue of $12.2 billion. Cisco shares, which closed at $24 on November 13 ahead of the company’s warning, fell almost 16 percent to $20.24 by mid-December, when Cisco also cut its long-term growth targets. The stock has gradually improved and closed at $22.71 on Tuesday. But this is likely because of investors’ long-term hopes rather than any illusions about a quick turnaround. “Anybody who’s been buying here is certainly going to be patient,” Leopold said.

506,IBM,"RPT-UPDATE 2-For Lenovo, ThinkPad turnaround provides blueprint for Motorola handset future","* Q3 net profit $265.3 mln, up 29 pct from year earlier * Acquisitions to weigh on earnings in short term -CEO * Profit recovery after 2005 ThinkPad buy took two years By Paul Carsten BEIJING, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Lenovo Group Ltd  leader Yang Yuanqing says the Chinese technology giant will draw on cost-cutting lessons learned when it bought IBM Corp’s  ThinkPad laptop unit to turn losses into profit at businesses acquired for $5.2 billion last month. Reporting third-quarter profit jumped 29 percent, Lenovo’s chief executive warned the drive to turn around the Motorola handset business it bought from Google Inc and the computer server unit it bought from IBM will squeeze earnings in the short term. For Yang, the pain may only last “a couple of quarters” after the deals close, he said, and is worth it: though October-December personal computer sales were strong, the aggressive acquisitions are a key plank in Lenovo’s search for future sources of growth as the broader desktop PC market shrinks and computer users go mobile. “In the short term (the deals) will have a negative impact on performance,” Yang said in a telephone interview after the earnings were announced. Lenovo, the world’s biggest maker of PCs, later specified it will likely take three to five quarters to turn around the Motorola phone business. Analysts say it may take the company at least that long to turn around its acquisitions. Heavyweights like Samsung Electronics Co and Apple Inc, dominant in global smartphones, will also provide stiff competition as Lenovo seeks to build up the Motorola business. “I’m expecting a slowdown in the underlying, organic business,” said Jean-Louis Lafayeedney, a Hong Kong-based technology analyst at JI Asia, an affiliate of Societe Generale. “It will be at least a year before Lenovo can turn around growth,” he said, speaking before Yang’s comments. Investors might be experiencing déjà vu. Motorola Mobility and the IBM x86 server unit currently lose money - Motorola alone lost more than $1 billion in 2013 - just as ThinkPad did when it became the Chinese company’s way into businesses across the United States in 2005. After the ThinkPad deal, Lenovo’s net income dropped sharply and only recovered after almost two years. To bring the new acquisitions into the fold, Lenovo plans to revive its tactic of integrating ThinkPad through cost-cutting, lower material costs and merging the business with its own supply chain. Lenovo will sell Motorola handsets and IBM servers through the same channels it uses for its own low-margin smartphones and its PC business, Yang said in a post-earnings call, without elaborating on financial targets. Lenovo said it plans to re-introduce the Motorola brand to its home country - a smartphone market now beginning to become saturated - as well as expanding to emerging markets. A key part of its strategy for IBM’s low-end servers is to surf on Lenovo’s presence in China, where it said server demand remains strong. But the sheer size of these deals - the price tag is close to half of Lenovo’s market value - will weigh on the company for some time. Analysts don’t expect the deals to be finalised until the third quarter of 2014 at the very earliest. “They did not have a choice, they had to acquire a business to take their smartphones to the developed markets,” said Lafayeedney. “They cannot waste the kind of time needed to grow organically into developed markets,” the analyst said, speaking before the October-December earnings were announced. Lenovo on Thursday reported net income of $265.3 million for the October-December quarter, ended before the acquisitions splurge. That was well above the $204.9 million it posted a year earlier, as well as a $247.2 million consensus forecast on Thomson Reuters Starmine SmartEstimate. Although Lenovo is the world’s fourth-biggest manufacturer of smartphones by shipments as of the quarter ended December, according to data firm IDC, the company is still dependent on China for the vast majority of its sales. Of the 13.9 million handsets Lenovo shipped in that quarter according to IDC, Lenovo said on Thursday only 2 million, or 14 percent, of those were sold outside China. Yang told analysts in a conference call the smartphone unit does not yet contribute a lot to the overall profit of Lenovo, particularly in China, where margins are slimmer than in other markets. Overall China smartphone shipments fell for the first time in more than two years in the quarter ended December, declining 4.3 percent quarter-on-quarter to 90.8 million handsets, according to IDC. The speed and scale of the buying spree - partly paid for by issuing new shares - spooked some investors. Earlier this month Lenovo shares tumbled 16 percent in one day after a report said the company was interested in buying Sony Corp’s Vaio PC division. Lenovo shares have dropped 8.7 percent since the start of the year, compared with the Hong Kong index’s loss of 4.82 percent. By close of trading on Thursday, the stock was down 0.58 percent, while the index was off 0.54 percent.

508,IBM,"UPDATE 2-For Lenovo, ThinkPad turnaround provides blueprint for Motorola handset future","* Q3 net profit $265.3 mln, up 29 pct from year earlier * Acquisitions to weigh on earnings in short term -CEO * Profit recovery after 2005 ThinkPad buy took two years By Paul Carsten BEIJING, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Lenovo Group Ltd  leader Yang Yuanqing says the Chinese technology giant will draw on cost-cutting lessons learned when it bought IBM Corp’s  ThinkPad laptop unit to turn losses into profit at businesses acquired for $5.2 billion last month. Reporting third-quarter profit jumped 29 percent, Lenovo’s chief executive warned the drive to turn around the Motorola handset business it bought from Google Inc and the computer server unit it bought from IBM will squeeze earnings in the short term. For Yang, the pain may only last “a couple of quarters” after the deals close, he said, and is worth it: though October-December personal computer sales were strong, the aggressive acquisitions are a key plank in Lenovo’s search for future sources of growth as the broader desktop PC market shrinks and computer users go mobile. “In the short term (the deals) will have a negative impact on performance,” Yang said in a telephone interview after the earnings were announced. Lenovo, the world’s biggest maker of PCs, later specified it will likely take three to five quarters to turn around the Motorola phone business. Analysts say it may take the company at least that long to turn around its acquisitions. Heavyweights like Samsung Electronics Co and Apple Inc, dominant in global smartphones, will also provide stiff competition as Lenovo seeks to build up the Motorola business. “I’m expecting a slowdown in the underlying, organic business,” said Jean-Louis Lafayeedney, a Hong Kong-based technology analyst at JI Asia, an affiliate of Societe Generale. “It will be at least a year before Lenovo can turn around growth,” he said, speaking before Yang’s comments. Investors might be experiencing déjà vu. Motorola Mobility and the IBM x86 server unit currently lose money - Motorola alone lost more than $1 billion in 2013 - just as ThinkPad did when it became the Chinese company’s way into businesses across the United States in 2005. After the ThinkPad deal, Lenovo’s net income dropped sharply and only recovered after almost two years. To bring the new acquisitions into the fold, Lenovo plans to revive its tactic of integrating ThinkPad through cost-cutting, lower material costs and merging the business with its own supply chain. Lenovo will sell Motorola handsets and IBM servers through the same channels it uses for its own low-margin smartphones and its PC business, Yang said in a post-earnings call, without elaborating on financial targets. Lenovo said it plans to re-introduce the Motorola brand to its home country - a smartphone market now beginning to become saturated - as well as expanding to emerging markets. A key part of its strategy for IBM’s low-end servers is to surf on Lenovo’s presence in China, where it said server demand remains strong. But the sheer size of these deals - the price tag is close to half of Lenovo’s market value - will weigh on the company for some time. Analysts don’t expect the deals to be finalised until the third quarter of 2014 at the very earliest. “They did not have a choice, they had to acquire a business to take their smartphones to the developed markets,” said Lafayeedney. “They cannot waste the kind of time needed to grow organically into developed markets,” the analyst said, speaking before the October-December earnings were announced. Lenovo on Thursday reported net income of $265.3 million for the October-December quarter, ended before the acquisitions splurge. That was well above the $204.9 million it posted a year earlier, as well as a $247.2 million consensus forecast on Thomson Reuters Starmine SmartEstimate. Although Lenovo is the world’s fourth-biggest manufacturer of smartphones by shipments as of the quarter ended December, according to data firm IDC, the company is still dependent on China for the vast majority of its sales. Of the 13.9 million handsets Lenovo shipped in that quarter according to IDC, Lenovo said on Thursday only 2 million, or 14 percent, of those were sold outside China. Yang told analysts in a conference call the smartphone unit does not yet contribute a lot to the overall profit of Lenovo, particularly in China, where margins are slimmer than in other markets. Overall China smartphone shipments fell for the first time in more than two years in the quarter ended December, declining 4.3 percent quarter-on-quarter to 90.8 million handsets, according to IDC. The speed and scale of the buying spree - partly paid for by issuing new shares - spooked some investors. Earlier this month Lenovo shares tumbled 16 percent in one day after a report said the company was interested in buying Sony Corp’s Vaio PC division. Lenovo shares have dropped 8.7 percent since the start of the year, compared with the Hong Kong index’s loss of 4.82 percent. By close of trading on Thursday, the stock was down 0.58 percent, while the index was off 0.54 percent.

India, which wants local production of chips to cut long-term import bills, has renewed a drive to attract investments after a previous attempt failed. The two groups had proposed building plants in India in September. One of the consortia is made up of India’s Jaiprakash Associates Ltd and TowerJazz and IBM. It plans to set up a plant near New Delhi at a cost of 343.99 billion rupees ($5.52 billion), a government statement said on Friday. The second comprises HSMC Technologies India Private Ltd, Malaysia’s Silterra and STMicroelectronics. The group has  proposed investment of 290.13 billion rupees ($4.65 billion) for a plant in the western Gujarat state, the statement said. The final agreements for the two plants are expected to be signed by August. With a view to attract chipmakers to set up plants in India, the government is offering concessions including 25 percent  subsidy on capital spending, tax breaks, and interest-free loans of about 51.24 billion rupees to each plant. India’s demand for electronics products is forecast to rise nearly 10 times during this decade to reach $400 billion by 2020, causing policy makers to worry that electronics imports, with no major local manufacturing, could exceed those of oil.",2142014,http://www.reuters.com/article/india-semiconductor/india-approves-two-semiconductor-wafer-plants-worth-10-billion-idUSL3N0LJ3GO20140214

Several workers gather outside gate of the International Business Machines Corp factory in Shenzhen on Thursday said production remains suspended for a fourth straight day. “So far, we’ve heard nothing from the management or the government in response to our demands,” said Hou Hongbo, a 10- year worker at the factory. “The company’s attitude so far is to ignore us, but the entire production remains shut down.” The workers want higher pay if they choose to transfer to Lenovo or higher severance packages if they choose to leave. Hou said they were determined to keep their action going. “We will definitely keep striking tomorrow,” he said. The terms offered to workers at the International System Technology Company factory in Shenzhen are “comparable in aggregate to what they currently are receiving,” IBM spokeswoman Florence Ma said in an e-mailed statement. If workers choose to leave, they will receive an “equitable severance package,” Ma said. “We are hoping employees will decide to remain with ISTC,” Ma said. Lenovo declined comment.

512,IBM,RPT-IBM factory strike shows shifting China labour landscape,"By John Ruwitch SHANGHAI, March 9 (Reuters) - A wildcat strike at an IBM factory in southern China illustrates how tectonic shifts under way in the country’s labor market are emboldening workers to take matters into their own hands, raising risks for multinationals. More than 1,000 workers walked off the job last week at the factory in Shenzhen, bordering Hong Kong, after managers on March 3 announced the terms of their transfer to new ownership under Chinese PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd. Lenovo agreed in January to pay $2.3 billion for International Business Machine’s low-end server business. The strike, which continued into Sunday, fits a growing pattern of industrial activism that has emerged as China’s economy has slowed. A worsening labour shortage has shifted the balance of power in labour relations, while smartphones and social media have helped workers organise and made them more aware than ever of the changing environment, experts say. “Chinese workers, after being exploited for so long, are now more and more aware of their rights and united. They have more of an idea of collective action,” said labour lawyer Duan Yi. A report by the advocacy group China Labour Bulletin last month said it had talled 1,171 strikes and protests from the beginning of June 2011 to the end of December 2013. Many worker protests during that time in Guangdong province, a manufacturing hub where the IBM server factory is situated, were sparked by the closure, merger or relocation of factories. In November, hundreds of employees stopped work at a Nokia factory in Dongguan, near Shenzhen, complaining of changes following Nokia’s sale of its mobile phone business to U.S. software giant Microsoft Corp. Lawyer Duan is seeking arbitration for a group of 70 Nokia workers who were laid off at the time. Last August, 5,000 workers in eastern Shandong Province went on strike to protest Apollo Tyres Ltd’s proposed $2.5 billion acquisition of U.S.-based Cooper Tire & Rubber Co . The deal was eventually scuttled and Cooper reported this month that the work stoppage in China had cut operating profit by $29 million in the third quarter. The labour shortage has pushed up wages, impelled employers to cast a wide net to find employees and enhance benefits to retain staff. Workers have gained leverage. “Workers know they have greater power,” said Geoffrey Crothall, a China labour expert with China Labour Bulletin. IBM said last week the terms offered to the workers at the International System Technology Company factory in Shenzhen were “comparable in aggregate to what they currently are receiving” and severance packages would be “equitable”. Lenovo has declined to comment. Technology has helped China’s workers. When the Nokia factory employees took to the street, they organised through the online chat system QQ and other social media, one worker told Reuters by telephone from Dongguan. In the IBM case, the workers had all read about prior strikes, including Nokia’s, and suspected ahead of time that they might have to make a similar stand, said a 28-year-old worker surnamed Chen who has worked there for three years. “We were basically prepared and expected in advance there wouldn’t be a good deal,” he said by telephone from Shenzhen. He declined to allow his full name to be published out of concern he might face repercussions.

517,IBM,IBM says it has not given client data to the U.S. government,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp has not relinquished its customers’ data to the U.S. government and would challenge any orders to do so, the company said in a blog post on Friday. The post by the world’s largest technology service provider is the latest backlash by a tech company against U.S. electronic surveillance practices, after published reports on Wednesday that alleged the government used websites to break into computers. “IBM has not provided client data to the NSA or any other government agency under any surveillance program involving the bulk collection of content or metadata,” Robert Weber, IBM’s senior vice president of legal and regulatory affairs, wrote in the blog post. “If the U.S. government were to serve a national security order on IBM to obtain data from an enterprise client and impose a gag order that prohibits IBM from notifying that client, IBM will take appropriate steps to challenge the gag order through judicial action or other means,” Weber said. He added that the New York-based company would challenge national security orders to obtain data stored outside the United States and that efforts to access that data should go through recognized legal channels like treaties. The NSA has “co-opted” more than 140,000 computers since August 2007 to inject them with spying software, according to a slide leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden and published by The Intercept news website on Wednesday.] In a statement, the NSA said the reports were “inaccurate” and said it does not target users of global Internet services without appropriate legal authority. “Reports of indiscriminate computer exploitation operations are simply false,” the agency said. IBM is one of several U.S. tech companies hit by the growing government spying scandal. Its sales to China fell by 20 percent in the second half of last year as Beijing encouraged state- owned companies to buy China-branded products on fears of U.S. government spying. In the post, Weber also called for greater transparency and a robust debate about government surveillance. “Data is the next great natural resource, with the potential to improve lives and transform institutions for the better.

519,IBM,UPDATE 2-U.S. top court wary of major change to software patent law,"(Adds details from argument and background) By Lawrence Hurley WASHINGTON, March 31 (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices stepped gingerly into a raging debate over computer software on Monday, voicing concerns about vaguely defined patents but signaling they would avoid any radical change to existing law. This may help tech companies fend off lawsuits filed by “patent trolls,” defined as companies that hold patents only for the purpose of suing firms seeking to develop new products, but not as much as a broad ruling would. For companies holding many patents, such as IBM Corp , a narrow ruling from the court would be better than a broader decision that tightened patent eligibility. From their questions during an hour-long oral argument, the justices appeared likely to rule, as expected, that patents held by Australian company Alice Corp Pty Ltd for a computer system that facilitates financial transactions were not patent eligible. CLS Bank International, which uses similar technology, challenged the patents in 2007. Although some of the nine justices signaled a willingness to go further and provide new guidance to lower courts that would describe exactly what types of computer-implemented inventions were patent eligible, others suggested there was no need for so broad a ruling. A ruling is expected by the end of June. If the court were to avoid any major pronouncements, the outcome could mirror a 2010 case, Bilski v. Kappos, in which the court was expected to offer guidance on business method patents but eventually issued a relatively narrow 9-0 decision. Chief Justice John Roberts questioned whether a proposed test, suggested by Solicitor General Donald Verrilli on behalf of President Barack Obama’s administration, would make the complex issue any clearer. “I’m just doubtful that’s going to bring about greater clarity and certainty,” Roberts said of the proposal. Justice Sonia Sotomayor also suggested the court might steer clear of the broader question. “Why do we have to ... reach software patents at all in this case?” she asked Verrilli. The case is being closely watched by a broad swath of companies in the technology sector and beyond. Google Inc, Dell Inc, Verizon Communications Inc, Microsoft Corp, and Hewlett-Packard Co were among a large list of companies that filed friend-of-the-court briefs in support of CLS. A smaller number, including engine manufacturer Cummins Inc , supported Alice, while others, like IBM, supported neither side. Companies vary over what kind of eligibility threshold they would prefer. Those that often get sued for patent infringement, such as Google, favor a tighter definition. Those that want to protect their many patents, such as IBM, would prefer that most software be patent eligible. In May 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., ruled for CLS but the judges were split 5-5 on which legal test to adopt. On the patents contested in the case, several justices, including Anthony Kennedy and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, suggested  they appeared to be too abstract to be eligible for patents. Previous Supreme Court rulings have said abstract ideas are generally not eligible for patents unless the inventor shows a way of applying the idea. Making references to ancient Greek inventor Archimedes and other historical figures, Justice Stephen Breyer was one of the court members who appeared keen on a ruling that would have broad application. On the one hand, he noted, patent eligibility that is too broad creates monopolies and reduces competition down to “who has the best patent lawyer.” On the other hand, if patent eligibility is too strict, it could “rule out real inventions with computers,” he added.

520,IBM,Synnex results beat estimates as IT spending rises,"(Reuters) - Hardware distributor Synnex Corp (SNX.N) reported better-than-expected quarterly results as it benefited from higher spending on information technology and the acquisition of International Business Machines Corp’s (IBM.N) customer-care business process outsourcing operations. Synnex’s shares rose nearly 15 percent in extended trading after the company also forecast current-quarter results above Street estimates. “We believe the strength we have recently experienced in IT demand will continue in our second quarter,” Chief Executive Kevin Murai said in a statement. The devices market, which includes personal computers, ultramobiles, mobile phones and tablets, was forecast to return to growth in 2014 after declining 1.4 percent in 2013, technology researcher Gartner Inc (IT.N) said on Wednesday. Synnex, which distributes data center servers, networking equipment and storage products and services, said revenue in its technology business unit rose 20 percent. The company acquired IBM’s customer-care business in September last year and merged it with Concentrix, its global business services division. Revenue in the division nearly tripled to $127 million. Synnex forecast current-quarter adjusted profit of $1.34-$1.38 per share on revenue of $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion. Analysts were expecting a profit of $1.14 per share on revenue of $3.01 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Synnex’s net income rose to $38.5 million, or $1.01 per share, in the quarter ended February 28, from $33.4 million, or 88 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, profit was $1.25 per share. Revenue jumped 23 percent to $3.03 billion. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 94 cents per share on revenue of $2.77 billion. “We saw good demand in personal computers and notebooks which we attribute in part to the refresh driven by support of Windows XP going away this month,” Murai said on a post-earnings conference call with analysts. The company’s shares closed at $62.42 on the New York Exchange on Thursday.

524,IBM,IBM's quarterly revenue sinks to 5-year low as hardware sales fall,"(Reuters) - IBM Corp reported its lowest quarterly revenue in five years on Wednesday as the company struggles with falling demand for its storage and server products. Shares of Big Blue fell about 4 percent to $188.20 in after-hours trade. Total revenue fell 4 percent to $22.5 billion in the first quarter, below analysts’ average estimate of $22.91 billion. “They have had eight revenue declines in a row. They have missed so many times, it’s hard to keep track of it,” said Fred Hickey, editor of The High-Tech Strategist newsletter, which is widely read by investors. The revenue was the lowest since the first quarter of 2009, when revenue was $21.71 billion. Revenue from the hardware business, which includes servers and systems storage, plunged 23 percent to $2.4 billion. IBM has been restructuring its business, with job reductions and the sale of its low-end server business to Chinese PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd for $2.3 billion in January, in efforts to achieve its targeted operating earnings of $20 per share by 2015. The company on Wednesday reiterated its full-year operating earnings target of $18 per share. “They used to be a leader. Now they sell one business after the next. That is not a way to grow,” Hickey, who has followed IBM for 30 years, said. IBM warned that its hardware business may continue to face hurdles. “As we look to the balance of 2014, we continue to expect good performance in the key growth areas, though our overall revenue growth will be impacted by the challenges in our hardware business,” Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter said on a conference call. Revenue in the Americas fell 4 percent, while revenue dropped 12 percent in Asia Pacific and declined 11 percent in emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia, India and China. Software was the only major business to show some growth, with revenue rising 1.6 percent to $5.66 billion, but the growth rate was slower than the fourth quarter’s 2.8 percent. Last month, the technology research firm Gartner reported that IBM lost its spot as the world’s No. 2 software make behind Microsoft Corp. Oracle Corp claimed that spot, which IBM had held for years. “They are not yet getting the kind of lift off of software that they would need to pump up overall IBM revenues into positive growth territory,” Forrester analyst Andrew Bartels said. IBM plans to spend more than $1.2 billion to expand its web-based software products, better known as cloud computing. IBM said its cloud revenue was up more than 50 percent in the quarter. The annual run rate of cloud delivered as a service doubled from last year to $2.3 billion. Moving to the cloud allows businesses to cut costs by ditching bulky servers for network-based software and using remote data centers run by technology companies. Recently, IBM has bought two companies to expand its cloud business, Silverpop, a developer of cloud-based marketing software, and cloud-based database software startup Cloudant. The company spent $3.1 billion to acquire 10 companies in 2013. In January, IBM said it will invest more than $1 billion to establish a new business unit for Watson - the supercomputer system that beat humans on the television quiz show “Jeopardy” - deployed on SoftLayer cloud computing infrastructure business the company bought last year [ID:nL3N0KJ22N] The global cloud services market last year grew by almost a fifth to an estimated $131 billion, according to research firm Gartner. IBM Markets Intelligence estimates the market could be as big as $200 billion by 2020. “We don’t see where the upside is going to come, unless there is something major — a major restructuring or other major change,” Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer with Solaris Asset Management, which helps manage some $1.5 billion, told Reuters. Ghriskey said Watson has yet to yield any blockbuster products capable of turning around the revenue declines. “Watson is a way to give them visibility, something for salesmen to talk about.” IBM’s first-quarter net profit fell to $2.38 billion, or $2.29 per share, from $3.03 billion, or $2.70 per share, a year earlier.

529,IBM,Mexican mobile phone operator sues IBM for $2.5 billion,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mexican mobile phone operator Iusacell SA de CV sued IBM Corp on Wednesday, accusing the U.S. technology giant of making fraudulent representations that caused it to lose $2.5 billion in profits. The lawsuit, filed in federal district court in New York, centered on a contract that Iusacell said IBM induced it to enter into in Mexico. “Events subsequent to the execution of the agreement have revealed that IBM both knowingly misrepresented and wrongfully concealed from Iusacell material facts both before and during the parties’ relationship,” Iusacell said in the complaint. IBM said in a statement that the lawsuit was a “transparent attempt” by Iusacell, which is co-owned by media and retail mogul Ricardo Salinas’ Grupo Salinas and broadcast giant Grupo Televisa, to avoid its contractual obligations. IBM said it signed a long-term contract with Iusacell in 2010 under which IBM’s Mexican unit made significant investments in Iusacell’s business. “Despite major improvement to Iusacell’s information technology infrastructure and growth in Iusacell’s revenues, Iusacell has failed to pay IBM Mexico what it is owed under the contract,” IBM said in the statement. IBM’s Mexican unit already has filed an arbitration claim against Iusacell in an effort to enforce the contract, according to IBM, which called Wednesday’s lawsuit an “ill-advised attempt to end-run” that case. A spokesman for Grupo Salinas had no immediate comment on the case and a lawyer for Iusacell did not respond to a request for comment. According to the lawsuit, Iusacell’s management designed a plan to boost the market share and revenue of the company, which was then the third-largest mobile phone operator in Mexico. Doubtful its existing information technology systems could support the plan, Iusacell sought advice from IBM, the lawsuit said. Several pages of the complaint are then redacted, leaving it unclear what happened next. Iusacell, however, said in the lawsuit that IBM’s capacity limits crippled its performance. It is not known why parts of the complaint were redacted. Companies sometimes seek to keep material confidential to protect trade secrets. The lawsuit seeks $2.5 billion in damages. Iusacell said its claims are governed by Mexican law, which entitles it to both actual damages and lost profits that stemmed from its reliance on the alleged IBM misrepresentations. The case is Iusacell SA de CV v. International Business Machines Corporation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-2697.

The lawsuit, filed in federal district court in New York, was heavily redacted, leaving many of the claims unclear. But the complaint centered on a contract Iusacell claimed IBM induced it to enter into in Mexico. “Events subsequent to the execution of the agreement have revealed that IBM both knowingly misrepresented and wrongfully concealed from Iusacell material facts both before and during the parties relationship,” Iusacell said in the complaint. The lawsuit seeks more than $2.5 billion in damages. A spokeswoman for IBM did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

534,IBM,"Ford, IBM to face renewed U.S. lawsuit over apartheid-era abuses","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co (F.N) and IBM Corp (IBM.N) will again have to face a U.S. lawsuit claiming they encouraged race-based human rights abuses in apartheid-era South Africa, despite a series of recent court decisions limiting the right to pursue such cases. Reviving a 12-year-old lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin in Manhattan accepted an argument from a group of plaintiffs that corporations may be held liable under a 1789 law, the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), that lets non-U.S. citizens pursue some cases in U.S. courts over alleged violations of international law. “No principle of domestic or international law supports the conclusion that the norms enforceable through the ATS ... apply only to natural persons and not to corporations,” Scheindlin wrote. Her decision came in a case that the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, also in Manhattan, in August had said should be dismissed. “Obviously we’re thrilled,” said Diane Sammons, a partner at Nagel Rice law firm in Roseland, New Jersey, representing some plaintiffs. “Judge Scheindlin is not taking the word of the defendants that corporations are not liable for human rights abuses under the ATS.” Sammons said she plans to file an amended complaint. Jonathan Hacker, an O’Melveny & Myers partner who represents Ford, did not respond immediately to requests for comment. Keith Hummel, a partner at Cravath, Swaine & Moore who represents IBM, did not respond immediately to similar requests. The plaintiffs contended that by having made military vehicles and computers for South African security forces, several companies during the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s had aided and abetted South Africa’s former apartheid government in perpetrating abuses, such as killings and torture. The litigation seeks class action status, with potential damages in the billions of dollars. Last April, the U.S. Supreme Court limited the sweep of the Alien Tort Statute, in the case Kiobel et al v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co et al. In a decision by Chief Justice John Roberts, the court held that the 1789 law was presumed to cover only violations of international law occurring in the United States, and that violations elsewhere must “touch and concern” U.S. territory “with sufficient force to displace the presumption.” Four months later, Circuit Judge Jose Cabranes wrote for the 2nd Circuit that these findings meant the case against Ford and IBM should be dismissed, having “plainly barred common-law suits, like this one, alleging violations of customary international law based solely on conduct occurring abroad.” The plaintiffs, however, said Cabranes’ ruling was based on arguments made before the Supreme Court’s decision in the Kiobel case, and sought a chance to meet the new, tighter standard set by that court. Thursday’s decision provides that chance, and Scheindlin set a May 15 deadline to file a new complaint against Ford and IBM, whose full name is International Business Machines Corp. Germany’s Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE) and Rheinmetall AG (RHMG.DE) had also been defendants, but Scheindlin agreed in December that the Kiobel decision barred claims against them. General Motors Corp had also been among the defendants, but Sammons said claims against it were discharged during that automaker’s 2009 bankruptcy.

The two were the latest to post earnings that topped expectations, helping to lift the S&P; 500 and the Nasdaq to their fourth straight daily advance. Tech bellwethers Google and IBM fell on disappointing figures and limited the broader market’s gain. IBM’s slide pushed the Dow into slightly negative territory at the close. With less than one-fifth of S&P; 500 companies having reported results so far, about 63 percent have topped earnings expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, exceeding the 56 percent average over the past four quarters. About 52 percent have beaten revenue forecasts, about even with the 54 percent average over the past four quarters. Morgan Stanley (MS.N) rose 2.9 percent to $30.76 after the financial services company reported a rise in first-quarter earnings, while Goldman Sachs (GS.N) edged up 0.1 percent to $157.44 after reporting earnings that fell less than expected. General Electric (GE.N) posted a 12 percent rise in overall industrial profits and its stock gained 1.7 percent to $26.56. “Today’s earnings were mixed, with some beating and others missing expectations, but the results we’ve seen this week have given the season a positive tone,” said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis, which has $787 billion in assets. “We had expected a greater impact from weather, but industrials and banks are all doing better, which relieves that area of concern.” Tech shares capped the S&P; 500’s gain, with Google Inc (GOOGL.O) down 3.7 percent at $543.34 and IBM (IBM.N) off 3.3 percent at $190.01 a day after both reported earnings that failed to impress Wall Street. The results raised questions about those of other tech-sector companies. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI slipped 16.31 points, or 0.10 percent, to end at 16,408.54.

During the regular session, SanDisk Corp SNDK.O was the S&P; 500’s biggest gainer and helped boost the Nasdaq 100 .NDX. SanDisk’s stock shot up 9.4 percent to close at $82.99 a day after the company reported first-quarter revenue ahead of expectations. Baker Hughes BHI.N shares hit their highest price since August 2011 after the world’s third-largest oilfield services company posted better-than-expected results as revenue in its core North American business rose nearly 7 percent. The stock climbed 3 percent to close at $68.33 after earlier rising as high as $69.78. UnitedHealth Group (UNH.N) fell 3.1 percent to $75.78 after the health insurer said it has spent more than $100 million to cover a pricey new hepatitis C drug from Gilead Sciences (GILD.O), a higher cost than it expected by “multiples.” Peer company WellPoint WLP.N slid 3.8 percent to end at $92. Questions from U.S. lawmakers on the cost of that drug prompted a sharp selloff in Gilead in mid-March that lasted for nearly a month. The stock rose 1 percent to $70 on Thursday.

538,IBM,IBM's quarterly revenue sinks to 5-year low as hardware sales fall,"(Reuters) - IBM Corp (IBM.N), the world’s biggest technology services company, reported its lowest quarterly revenue in five years on Wednesday, as Big Blue struggles with falling demand for its hardware and faces challenges in growth markets like China. Shares of IBM fell as much as 4 percent to $188.20 in after-hours trade. Revenue for the Armonk, NY-based firm fell 4 percent to $22.5 billion in the first quarter, below analysts’ average estimate of $22.91 billion. “They have had eight revenue declines in a row,” said Fred Hickey, editor of The High-Tech Strategist newsletter, which is widely read by investors. “They have missed so many times, it’s hard to keep track of it.” IBM’s first-quarter revenue was the lowest the company reported since the first quarter of 2009, when revenue was $21.71 billion. Hardware revenue, which includes servers and systems storage, plunged 23 percent to $2.4 billion, as sales in growth markets declined 11 percent, led by Asia-Pacific, where reported revenue declined 12 percent. IBM has been restructuring its business and laying-off workers in efforts to achieve its targeted operating earnings of $20 per share by 2015. In January, the company agreed to sell its low-end server business to Chinese PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd (0992.HK) for $2.3 billion in January. The company on Wednesday reiterated its full-year operating earnings target of $18 per share. “They used to be a leader,” said Hickey, who has followed IBM for 30 years. “Now they sell one business after the next. That is not a way to grow.” All segments of IBM’s systems and technology business reported double-digit declines, led by the System z segment, which fell 40 percent. The company warned that its hardware business may continue to face hurdles. “As we look to the balance of 2014, we continue to expect good performance in the key growth areas, though our overall revenue growth will be impacted by the challenges in our hardware business,” Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter said on a conference call. Revenue in the Americas fell 4 percent, while revenue in the emerging markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China declined 11 percent, led by China where revenue fell by 20 percent. Although IBM books only about 5 percent of its sales in China, declining revenue over the last three quarters has been dragging down the company’s emerging markets business overall. Chief Executive Ginni Rometty has visited China on two occasions in the last three months, seeking to restore trust with Chinese regulators in the wake of last year’s revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden of spying. That has undercut business at some U.S.-based multinationals operating in the world’s second-biggest economy. In February, Rometty held meetings with Chinese officials, including Vice Premier Wang Yang, who is responsible for helping to formulate China’s economic policy. “We expect it will take some time for our business in China to improve,” Schroeter said. Software was the only major business to show some growth, with revenue rising 1.6 percent to $5.66 billion, but the growth rate was slower than the fourth quarter’s 2.8 percent. Last month, the technology research firm Gartner reported that IBM lost its spot as the world’s No. 2 software make behind Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O). Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) claimed that spot, which IBM had held for years. “They are not yet getting the kind of lift off of software that they would need to pump up overall IBM revenues into positive growth territory,” Forrester analyst Andrew Bartels said. IBM plans to spend more than $1.2 billion to expand its web-based software products, better known as cloud computing. IBM said its cloud revenue was up more than 50 percent in the quarter. The annual run rate of cloud delivered as a service doubled from last year to $2.3 billion. Moving to the cloud allows businesses to cut costs by ditching bulky servers for network-based software and using remote data centers run by technology companies. Recently, IBM has bought two companies to expand its cloud business, Silverpop, a developer of cloud-based marketing software, and cloud-based database software startup Cloudant. The company spent $3.1 billion to acquire 10 companies in 2013. In January, IBM said it will invest more than $1 billion to establish a new business unit for Watson - the supercomputer system that beat humans on the television quiz show “Jeopardy” - deployed on SoftLayer cloud computing infrastructure business the company bought last year. The global cloud services market last year grew by almost a fifth to an estimated $131 billion, according to research firm Gartner. IBM Markets Intelligence estimates the market could be as big as $200 billion by 2020. “We don’t see where the upside is going to come, unless there is something major — a major restructuring or other major change,” Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer with Solaris Asset Management, which helps manage some $1.5 billion, told Reuters. Ghriskey said Watson has yet to yield any blockbuster products capable of turning around the revenue declines. “Watson is a way to give them visibility, something for salesmen to talk about.” IBM’s first-quarter net profit fell to $2.38 billion, or $2.29 per share, from $3.03 billion, or $2.70 per share, a year earlier. The results included a $870 million charge related to job cuts, the company said. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $2.54 per share. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $2.54 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The stock, which gained 4.6 percent over the last three months, closed at $196.40 on the Nasdaq on Wednesday.

The technology sector capped the S&P; 500’s gain, with Google  shares down 3.2 percent at $545.81 and IBM off 3.2 percent at $190.28 after both reported earnings late Wednesday that failed to impress Wall Street. Their results raised questions about those of other tech-sector companies. “The market is digesting the sharp move we’ve seen this week and doing its best to ignore the results from IBM and Google, which didn’t look great,” said Steve Sosnick, equity risk manager at Timber Hill/Interactive Brokers Group in Greenwich, Connecticut. “I’m mostly focused on bank earnings, which have been OK for the most part, and there haven’t been many outliers, which is a good thing.” He said moves should be taken with a grain of salt as many trading desks are short-handed ahead of the long weekend.

Shares of Morgan Stanley, rose 3.6 percent to $30.97 after the financial services company reported a rise in first-quarter earnings, while Goldman Sachs edged up 0.4 percent to $157.91 after the bank reported an 11 percent drop in profits but beat expectations. UnitedHealth Group shares fell 3.2 percent to $75.70 after the largest U.S. health insurer said it has spent more than $100 million to cover a pricey new hepatitis C drug from Gilead Sciences, a higher cost than it expected by “multiples.” Shares in the health insurance sector fell on the news, with WellPoint down 3.4 percent at $92.45.

547,IBM,"IBM unveils new server model to tackle big data, analytics","NEW YORK (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp, in its latest attempt at reviving demand for its hardware products, is launching high-end system servers that it says are 50 times faster than its closest competitor at analyzing data. The POWER8 servers, the product of a $2.4 billion, three-year investment, are part of the company’s decade-long shift to higher-value hardware technology. IBM said the machines are 50 times faster than the low-end x86-based servers it sold to Chinese PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd in January. The technology services provider said on Wednesday it hopes the servers, designed for large-scale computing, will appeal to clients looking to manage new types of social and mobile computing and mass amounts of data. Last week, the company reported its lowest quarterly revenue in five years, weighed down by falling demand for its storage and server products. IBM dominates the higher-end server market with 57 percent market share, according to research firm Canalys. “For IBM customers in particular the POWER8 represents a generational jump forward so far as overall performance and system capacity goes,” said Charles King, an analyst at Pund-IT in California. “POWER8 should help IBM move forward in this very cloud-centric, analytic path that it has been working on,” he said. Some analysts, however, say that IBM’s shift to high-end servers makes products like POWER8 appealing only to niche customers. “Not every app needs a high-end server,” said Jefferies analyst Peter Misek. “With IBM getting out of that lower-end business, it dramatically shrinks their addressable market.” In order to make the servers adaptable to different needs, IBM released the data specifications for its POWER8 processor to the OpenPOWER foundation, allowing the development community to deliver new system designs based on POWER8. The foundation, whose more than two dozen members include Google, Israeli chip designer Mellanox Technologies, U.S. chip-maker Nvidia Corp and Taiwan-based server supplier Tyan Computer Corp, will have access to hardware previously proprietary to IBM.

Scientists carved the 11x14-micrometre image of two pandas that appeared on last month’s cover of the National Geographic Kids magazine onto a polymer using technology similar to 3D printing. “My idea was to do something similar to chiselling a rock, but just to do it on a nano-scale,” said Urs Duerig, a scientist at IBM in Switzerland and one of the inventors of the machine. The device, roughly the size of a family refrigerator, used a tiny chisel with a heatable silicon tip 100,000 times smaller than a sharpened pencil point to cut out the image. The technology could be used to make transistors, as well as nano-sized security tags to prevent the forgery of money, passports and artwork, scientists involved said. “The application range is quite broad,” said Felix Holzner, chief executive of SwissLitho, a startup to which the IBM technology has been licensed. “It’s like a 3D printer on a microscopic scale - you can make any structure you want but a million times smaller with this machine.” At the moment, the high-tech machines, which cost around 500,000 euros ($691,500), are intended as research tools rather than for use in the production industry, Holzner said.

554,IBM,Three Lawson Software founders settle SEC insider trading charges,"May 12 (Reuters) - Three Lawson Software Inc founders agreed to pay about $5.8 million to settle U.S. insider trading charges that they took advantage of incorrect media and analyst reports to trade stock ahead of the company’s 2011 merger. Monday’s accord resolves U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges that former Co-Chairman Richard Lawson, 70, tipped his brother William Lawson, 72, and friend John Cerullo, 71, that the company was not the object of a bidding war, and that a lone bidder was offering less than the market price. The defendants did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. Lawson Software on March 14, 2011 announced it had received an unsolicited offer, which it later accepted, to be acquired by Infor Global Solutions and an affiliate of private equity firm Golden Gate Capital for about $1.8 billion, or $11.25 per share. According to the SEC, media and analyst reports, including from Reuters, were speculating at the time that suitors including Hewlett-Packard Co, International Business Machines Corp, Oracle Corp and SAP AG  might offer higher bids, but that Richard Lawson told his brother and Cerullo this was not the case. The SEC said William Lawson, a third party tipped by him and Cerullo together made over $2 million by selling more than 1.8 million shares at prices inflated by the speculation. It said that when a definitive $11.25 per share merger for Lawson Software was announced on April 26, 2011, the St. Paul, Minnesota-based company’s stock price fell 8.8 percent. “When news surfaces about the possibility of a merger and details of the media reports are incorrect, it is illegal for insiders who know the true facts to trade and profit,” Stephen Cohen, an associate director in the SEC enforcement division, said in a statement. In settling with the SEC, Richard Lawson agreed to pay a $1.56 million fine; William Lawson, who was once Lawson Software’s chief executive, agreed to pay $3.87 million, including a $1.85 million fine; and Cerullo agreed to pay about $373,000, including a roughly $178,000 fine. Charles Gall, a lawyer for Richard Lawson, declined to comment. Terrence Fleming, a lawyer for William Lawson, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

557,IBM,UPDATE 1-IBM expects hardware business to grow in 2015,"(Adds details on Latin American growth, Chinese decline and updates hardware forecasts) By Marina Lopes NEW YORK, May 14 (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp said it expects its hardware sector to grow in 2015 as the company invests in research and development and divests low-performing ventures. The comments come less than one month after the world’s largest technology service company reported its lowest quarterly revenue in five years, weighed by sluggish global demand for its hardware, which plunged 23 percent in the first quarter of 2014. The company added that growth in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa remain strong, and blamed falling revenue in China on government reforms affecting state-owned clients, and on the country’s hardware-heavy portfolio. “We move on and we spread ourselves out, more industries, more clients, cloud, data, et cetera, around there,” said IBM Chief Executive Ginni Rometty at an investor briefing on Wednesday. Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter said to stabilize the hardware sector IBM would continue to “refresh” hardware and further invest in research and development. “Quite frankly, we are seeing very good growth out of software, good growth out of services, but challenges in hardware,” said Schroeter. “We will stabilize that hardware base and I am comfortable we will make that happen in 2014,” he said. He reiterated the company’s EPS target for 2015 of at least $20. He expects a shift to higher-value business to bring in $3.25 and share repurchases to add $2 in earnings per share by 2015. Higher tax rates will cost IBM $1.50 per share as tax credits run out, he said.

564,IBM,U.S. companies see smaller lift from stock buybacks,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM, one of the most reliable companies when it comes to buying back shares, is scaling back its repurchases just as the market seems to have grown weary of this strategy. Buybacks have been fruitful for companies and shareholders in recent years. Firms with larger buybacks outperformed the market for several quarters, but that streak is in jeopardy, as the S&P; 500 Buyback Index is down 0.2 percent for the quarter. The index, made up of 100 companies with the largest buyback ratio, is facing its first quarterly decline since the second quarter of 2012, when it was down 3.7 percent. It has outperformed the S&P; 500 in the last six quarters but trails the broader benchmark so far in the second quarter. Corporate buybacks have been strong in recent years, but higher stock valuations reduce the lift companies get from their repurchases. As economic growth improves, companies are more likely to invest in longer-term projects, such as capital expenditures. “With valuations not as attractive as where they were, it makes sense that investors are going to be a bit more selective and not reward buybacks as broadly as they had for the last couple of years,” said Jill Carey, U.S. equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York. “If growth starts to pick up, we think companies should start to do more investing in growth: capex or M&A.;” S&P; 500 companies that initiated buybacks in the first three months of 2014 underperformed the benchmark index by 0.25 percent in the month after announcing, while a similar group outperformed the index by 1.29 percent in the same period a year ago, date from Birinyi Associates showed. A quarter of the biggest buybacks have come from the pricey consumer discretionary sector, Carey said. The sector’s forward four-quarter P/E ratio is 17.8, above the S&P; 500’s 15.2, Thomson Reuters data showed. With at least $153 billion executed in the first quarter, S&P; 500 buybacks could mark the second-biggest total ever once final numbers are tallied, according to S&P; Dow Jones Indices. Apple accounted for $18 billion of the total. To be sure, companies with ongoing buyback programs tend to benefit more than others, said Tobias Levkovich, chief U.S. equity strategist at Citigroup in New York. “Buying back your stock for a short-term pop in your earnings isn’t going to get rewarded by the Street, if it is only a short-term phenomenon,” he said. A Citigroup index of companies that consistently buy back shares has more than doubled the S&P;’s return dating to 2002. This group includes IBM. IBM spent more on buybacks than any S&P; 500 company other than Exxon Mobil in the last five years. It said in its recent earnings call that it expects to finish the year with repurchases down a bit from last year. For 2013, the company’s buybacks totaled about $13.9 billion. Its shares are down 3.4 percent in the second quarter, after gaining 2.6 percent in the first.

565,IBM,UPDATE 3-China pushing banks to drop IBM servers in hacking dispute-report,"(Adds U.S. State Department comment) May 27 (Reuters) - China is pressuring its banks to remove high-end servers made by IBM and replace them with a local brand, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday, as tensions rise between Beijing and Washington over allegations of cyber espionage. A spokesman for International Business Machines Corp said the U.S. technology company was not aware of any such demands by the Chinese government. “IBM is not aware of any Chinese government policy recommending against the use of IBM servers within the country’s banking industry,” said IBM spokesman Ian Colley. “IBM is a trusted partner in China and has been for more than 30 years.” The Bloomberg report, which cited anonymous sources, comes a week after the U.S. Justice Department charged five Chinese military officers, accusing them of hacking American companies to steal trade secrets. China on Monday accused the United States of “unscrupulous” cyber surveillance that included large-scale computer attacks against the Chinese government and Chinese companies.  China has also told state-owned enterprises to sever links with U.S. consulting firms, The Financial Times reported on Sunday. The Bloomberg report said Chinese government agencies including the People's Bank of China and the Ministry of Finance are reviewing whether Chinese commercial banks' reliance on the IBM servers compromised the country's financial security. (r.reuters.com/dyf69v) The results of the review will be submitted to a working group on Internet security chaired by Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to Bloomberg. The U.S. State Department said the Justice Department’s hacking charges, announced on May 19, relate to a law enforcement investigation. “It doesn’t provide, in our view, any justification for retaliation against U.S. businesses or the U.S. government,” said State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki. “We continue to believe that a dialogue about cyber-related issues and concerns we have, and certainly concerns they have, is the best path forward,” she said, referring to the Chinese government. The Chinese central bank and finance ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman at China’s National Development and Reform Commission said the country’s top economic planner has not told companies to change their IBM servers, nor received orders from higher levels of the government to do so. Sources at China’s “big four” state-owned banks said they had no knowledge of pressure for a technology change, saying any replacement of such systems would not be an easy task. “We haven’t heard about the order,” an official at one of the bank’s IT department said, declining to be identified because he was not allowed to speak to the media. “There aren’t any locally made hardware around that can handle the massive amount of data in the banking industry.” Over the weekend a U.S. official told Reuters the government was looking at a number of measures to curb Chinese cyber espionage, including visa restrictions to prevent Chinese nationals from attending hacker conferences in the United States this summer    (Reporting by Xie Heng, Kang Xize, Koh Gui Qing and Aileen Wang in Beijing, Bi Xiaowen in Hong Kong, Arnab Sen in Bangalore, Jim Finkle in Boston, and Lesley Wroughton and Alina Selyukh in Washington; Writing by Kazunori Takada; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier and Kenneth Maxwell)",5272014,http://www.reuters.com/article/ibm-china/update-3-china-pushing-banks-to-drop-ibm-servers-in-hacking-dispute-report-idUSL3N0OD1KM20140527
566,IBM,"Rapid7 hires Jay Radcliffe, diabetic who hacked his insulin pump","BOSTON, April 24 (Reuters) - Cybersecurity firm Rapid7 said on Thursday that it has hired Jay Radcliffe, a diabetic researcher who is known for pioneering work in the field of medical security, including work hacking his own insulin pump. He will work as a researcher and consultant on the recently created professional services team at privately held Boston-based cybersecurity firm Rapid7. Radcliffe gained prominence in 2011 when he demonstrated a technique at the Def Con hacking conference in Las Vegas for attacking the same Medtronic Inc insulin pump that he uses to deliver insulin to his body. He hacked into the pump that regularly provides him with carefully measured doses of insulin by remotely accessing a wireless communications system the computerized pump uses to monitor its surroundings for commands. He said the approach could have been used to deliver lethal doses of insulin to patients. Medtronic later that year hired security consultants to review the safety of its insulin pumps after a second research team found more vulnerabilities in the devices, which they said were also potentially lethal. Radcliffe most recently worked as a senior security analyst at InGuardians Inc. Prior to that, he spent more than a decade holding various posts at Internet Security Systems, which IBM  bought in 2006. Radcliffe said in a blog posted on Rapid7’s website that he will continue his research on hacking medical devices, which has become a passion. “Emerging technologies in the medical world are often ill-equipped for the dangers that the interconnected world faces, and we need spokespeople to draw attention to these dangers,” he said in the blog. “As a diabetic, who depends on these interconnected devices to live, I find myself as an advocate in this arena.”   (Reporting by Jim Finkle; Editing by Eric Walsh)",5292014,http://www.reuters.com/article/rapid7-radcliffe/rapid7-hires-jay-radcliffe-diabetic-who-hacked-his-insulin-pump-idUSL1N0OF2BP20140529

On a 9-0 vote, the court ruled for CLS Bank International, which challenged patents held by Australia-based Alice Corporation Pty Ltd for a computer system that facilitates financial transactions. The court added some clarity to a confused area of the law concerning when software can be patented but did not provide a definitive test on when software can be patented as some had hoped. The ruling left open questions about under what circumstances the use of a computer adds enough to the idea to make it patent eligible. At a minimum, the ruling is likely to help tech companies fend off lawsuits filed by “patent trolls,” defined as companies that hold patents only for the purpose of suing firms seeking to develop new products. “It’s going to clear away a lot of illegitimate claims pretty quickly,” said Andrew Pincus, a lawyer with the Mayer Brown law firm who filed a brief on behalf of a technology trade group. The ruling in some ways mirrors a 2010 case, Bilski v. Kappos, in which the court was expected to offer guidance on business method patents but eventually issued a relatively narrow 9-0 decision. In Thursday’s majority opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that the outcome was determined by two of the court’s recent patent rulings. “We hold that the claims at issue are drawn to the abstract idea of intermediated settlement and that merely requiring generic computer implementation fails to transform that abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention,” Thomas wrote. The legal question boiled down to how innovative an invention should be to receive legal protection. The U.S. Patent Act states that anyone who “invents or discovers a new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter,” or an improvement of an existing one, can get a patent. An invention related to an abstract idea can be patented, but it must include a way of applying the idea. Google Inc, Dell In c , Verizon Communications Inc, and Microsoft Corp were among the companies that filed legal papers weighing in on the issue. Companies differ over what kind of eligibility threshold they would prefer. Those that often get sued for patent infringement, such as Google, favor a tighter definition. Those that want to protect their own patents, such as IBM Corp, would prefer that most software be patent eligible. In May 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled for CLS but the judges were split 5-5 on which legal test to adopt. The case is Alice Corp v.

576,IBM,U.S. charges two more in IBM insider trading case,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S prosecutors in Manhattan announced charges Wednesday against two men they said participated in a ring of information-sharing that led to illegal trading in a technology company acquired by IBM Corp IBM.N in 2009. Benjamin Durant, 37, was charged with two counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy, while Daryl Payton, 38, was charged with three securities fraud counts and one conspiracy count. Both were arrested during the morning, and later pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court. Their lawyers declined to comment following the arraignment. Three people have already admitted to sharing and trading on secret information provided by a corporate lawyer working on IBM’s purchase of software maker SPSS Inc in 2009.  The lawyer, who has not been charged, was identified in a related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit on Wednesday as Michael Dallas, a former associate at the New York law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore. IBM’s full name is International Business Machines Corp. A Cravath spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did an employer listed for Dallas on his LinkedIn page. Dallas could not immediately be reached. Authorities said Dallas shared information about the SPSS deal with his friend Trent Martin, an analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc RBS.L, who then told his roommate Thomas Conradt, who worked at Euro Pacific Capital Inc of Westport, Connecticut. Prosecutors say Conradt and a trading colleague, David Weishaus, bought call options on SPSS before IBM’s bid was announced, and Conradt tipped Durant and Payton. Martin, Conradt and Weishaus pleaded guilty last year to charges related to the trades, and agreed to cooperate in the investigation. Payton and Durant were also working for Euro Pacific at the time of the trading, according to public records kept by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. FINRA records show they left Euro Pacific at the same time the SEC informed the firm it was investigating them for options trades they made. The firm is not named in the indictment, which describes it as “Securities Trading Firm-1.” Andrew Schiff, director of marketing at Euro Pacific, said the firm cooperated in the investigation and has terminated employees who were implicated.

579,IBM,U.S. Ambassador Baucus says China hacking threatens national security,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Cyber theft of trade secrets by China is a threat to U.S. national security, U.S. Ambassador to China Max Baucus said on Wednesday in the first major public address of his tenure, warning that Washington would continue to pressure Beijing. Baucus’ remarks come as commercial ties between the world’s two largest economies have been strained over cyber espionage charges and revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden of U.S. spying. In May, Washington indicted five Chinese military officers for hacking U.S. companies, prompting Beijing to suspend a Sino-U.S. working group on cyber issues. It adamantly denies the charges. Such behavior is criminal and runs counter to China’s World Trade Organization commitments, Baucus told business leaders at an American Chamber of Commerce in China luncheon two weeks ahead of annual high-level bilateral talks in Beijing. “Cyber-enabled theft of trade secrets by state actors in China has emerged as a major threat to our economic, and thus, national security,” Baucus said. “We won’t sit idly by when a crime is committed in the real world. So why should we when it happens in cyber space?” he said. “We will continue to use diplomatic and legal means to make clear that this type of behavior must stop.” Tensions over cyber security rose in late 2012 after Washington banned Chinese communications equipment makers Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and ZTE Corp from building U.S. telecoms infrastructure. Beijing responded by pressuring big state-owned firms to stop buying U.S.-made hardware, emphasizing security risks following Snowden’s revelations, people in the industry said. U.S. equipment and software providers such as IBM Corp and Cisco Systems Inc have already seen their China sales drop after the Snowden leaks. Like a string of ambassadors before him, Baucus, a former Montana senator who arrived in Beijing in March, has made it his immediate priority to boost the two countries’ commercial and economic links. He has stressed that stronger economic ties will help resolve a host of thorny political and security challenges. Baucus said a bilateral investment treaty would help China rebalance its economy by opening up its service industries to more foreign investment and that moving forward negotiations would be among his top priorities as ambassador. “I believe that the U.S.-China bilateral investment treaty ... today could do for China’s investment regime what the WTO accession did 15 years ago,” Baucus said. The investment treaty talks, which were launched in 2008, will likely be at the center of the Strategic & Economic Dialogue that will bring U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew to Beijing in July. Disputes over cyber security topped the agenda at last year’s meeting, initiated in 2008 to help manage a relationship that is growing more complex with China’s emergence as major economic and military power. However, the annual talks have yielded few substantive agreements. Lew has said he will push China to speed up economic reforms and do more to allow markets to determine the value of its yuan currency. Washington’s aim for the investment treaty is to loosen Beijing’s restrictions in key sectors from service industries to agriculture, and ensure that foreign companies receive treatment equal to Chinese private and state-owned enterprises. China heavily restricts dozens of industries and U.S. firms have long complained they are forced to meet unfair burdens such as ownership caps and are pressured to transfer technology in exchange for market access.

586,IBM,IBM signs up to help fight China's war on smog,"BEIJING (Reuters) - IBM Corp has signed an agreement with the city of Beijing to use advanced weather forecasting and cloud computing technologies to help tackle the Chinese capital’s persistent smog. After a series of pollution scares and scandals, China’s central government has promised to reverse some of the damage done to the nation’s sky, rivers and soil by more than three decades of growth. But China has first had to improve data collection, monitoring and forecasting capabilities before it can work on cutting smog and pollution. Beijing city already uses an alerting system based on data from 35 monitoring stations, allowing it to shut schools and factories and cut traffic three days in advance, but residents still complain that not enough is being done. “Predicting is helpful because it helps prevent exposure, but it is not enough if it is only about knowing which days to put on masks or stay indoors,” said Ma Jun, director of the Institute of Environmental and Public Affairs, a non-government group that works to improve emissions data transparency.     Under the agreement with IBM, Beijing’s city government will be one of the partners in the company’s China-focused 10-year “Green Horizon” initiative, which aims to draw on IBM’s forecasting expertise and the collection of real-time emissions data to predict smog build-ups. “It is about how we can help cities improve management based on ‘Big Data’, and better predict (pollution) with accuracy so the government can take proactive action,” said Xiaowei Shen, China director of IBM Research, speaking at IBM’s lab in Beijing’s northwest high-tech district of Zhongguancun.         With China committed to reducing the share of coal in its energy mix, IBM’s cloud-based analytic systems could also be tailored to make better use of renewable energy, Shen said.  At the Zhangbei wind and solar power demonstration project run by the State Grid Corp in northern Hebei province, for instance, a supply and demand management system from IBM has helped reduce wasted power to just 20 percent from 30 percent. Better data about the make-up of the Beijing’s pollution could also lead to more effective action, said Wang Tao, resident scholar at the energy and climate change program at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy. “They can find out if stopping cars running is more effective, or stopping pollution from heavy industries,” Wang said. IBM representatives said the Green Horizon initiative could generate new commercial opportunities in pollution control and renewable energy in China. IBM’s sales in China have slumped since last year, hurt by a backlash against U.S.-based multinationals in the wake of revelations that the United States has been spying on foreign subjects and governments.

587,IBM,IBM to bet $3 bln over 5 years hoping for breakthrough in chips,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - IBM announced on Wednesday it will invest $3 billion over the next five years in chip research and development in hopes of finding a game-changing breakthrough that can help revive its  slumping hardware unit. IBM announced the plan a week before its widely anticipated second quarter earnings. Last quarter, sales in its hardware sector plunged 23 percent from a year earlier and the company posted its lowest quarterly revenue in five years. IBM hopes to find ways to scale and shrink silicon chips to make them more efficient, and research new materials to use in making chips, such as carbon nanotubes, which are more stable than silicon and are also heat resistant and can provide faster connections. “The message to our investors is that we are committed to this space, we believe there is great innovation possible that will be necessary in world of big data analytics, said Tom Rosamilia, senior vice president of IBM’s Systems and Technology Group. “These are essential ingredients in delivering the kind of performance the world will demand. The world is demanding it now and will continue to demand it for the next 10 years,” he said.   The investment is equal to half of all IBM’s research and development last year. The company is preparing to divest its chip manufacturing business to focus on intellectual property. The company is rumored to be close to a deal with chipmaker Globalfoundries Inc.  At an investor briefing in May, IBM’s Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter said new research and development was essential to refreshing the hardware sector, which he expects to stabilize in 2014 and grow in 2015.  Silicon chips, which have been made smaller every year, are reaching a point of diminishing returns, preventing chips from delivering performance improvements demanded by new technology,  the company said.      “You might say this is not a good time to be in the silicon chip business, but it is a great time to be ready for the next thing. This is the next thing,” said Richard Doherty a research director at The Envisioneering Group in Seaford, NY. IBM is the only major company investing in carbon chip research. As demand grows for faster speeds, the investment could put it miles ahead of competitors like Oracle and HP, said Doherty.

588,IBM,REFILE-IBM to bet $3 bln over 5 years hoping for breakthrough in chips,"(Fixes garble in paragraph 11) By Marina Lopes WASHINGTON, July 9 (Reuters) - IBM announced on Wednesday it will invest $3 billion over the next five years in chip research and development in hopes of finding a game-changing breakthrough that can help revive its  slumping hardware unit. IBM announced the plan a week before its widely anticipated second quarter earnings. Last quarter, sales in its hardware sector plunged 23 percent from a year earlier and the company posted its lowest quarterly revenue in five years. IBM hopes to find ways to scale and shrink silicon chips to make them more efficient, and research new materials to use in making chips, such as carbon nanotubes, which are more stable than silicon and are also heat resistant and can provide faster connections. “The message to our investors is that we are committed to this space, we believe there is great innovation possible that will be necessary in world of big data analytics, said Tom Rosamilia, senior vice president of IBM’s Systems and Technology Group. “These are essential ingredients in delivering the kind of performance the world will demand. The world is demanding it now and will continue to demand it for the next 10 years,” he said. The investment is equal to half of all IBM’s research and development last year. The company is preparing to divest its chip manufacturing business to focus on intellectual property. The company is rumored to be close to a deal with chipmaker Globalfoundries Inc. At an investor briefing in May, IBM’s Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter said new research and development was essential to refreshing the hardware sector, which he expects to stabilize in 2014 and grow in 2015. Silicon chips, which have been made smaller every year, are reaching a point of diminishing returns, preventing chips from delivering performance improvements demanded by new technology,  the company said. “You might say this is not a good time to be in the silicon chip business, but it is a great time to be ready for the next thing. This is the next thing,” said Richard Doherty a research director at The Envisioneering Group in Seaford, NY. IBM is the only major company investing in carbon chip research. As demand grows for faster speeds, the investment could put it miles ahead of competitors like Oracle and HP, said Doherty. Most electricity going through silicon chips gets released as heat, said Doherty, with only 30 percent going toward electricity.  “Silicon-electron mobility is like moving through snow. You can’t run as fast,” he said. One substance IBM has already done some research on is graphene, a pure carbon through which IBM says electrons can move 10 times faster than in silicon.

589,IBM,IBM to offer iPads and iPhones for business users,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp will partner exclusively with Apple Inc to sell iPhones and iPads loaded with applications geared at enterprise clients this fall, the company announced on Tuesday.  The announcement, just two days before IBM releases its second quarter earnings, comes as the company attempts to shift its focus to software and services as its hardware unit continues to slump, and follows a string of mobile software acquisitions. The company hopes software sales will contribute half of its total profit by 2015.  The company will release more than 100 apps targeting industry specific issues in retail, healthcare, banking, travel, transportation and telecommunications IBM said on Tuesday. “We wanted to focus on creating an absolutely irresistible workflow and processes and a design of apps that can be used by every user in the organization,” Bridget van Kralingen, IBM’s senior vice president of global business services told Reuters from Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California.  “We wanted to remove some of the existing barriers of mobile in enterprise,” she said adding that chief information officers worry about security, utilizing cloud and installing apps in mobile devices. The partnership, which was six months in the making, will offer services geared at security, mobile device management and big data and analytics. The company also plans to develop cloud services optimized for Apple’s mobile operating system, iOS. The devices will operate through wireless carriers chosen by the client, she said. BlackBerry Ltd shares were down 3 percent following the announcement. The Canadian smartphone maker has increasingly targeted its secure software at businesses as part of an effort to turn the company around after losing ground to Apple’s iPhone and Samsung Electronics Co.  Apple and Samsung have steadily expanded their share of the mobile enterprise market in recent years, mostly at Blackberry’s expense, while Microsoft Windows phones have made little headway. Increasingly, Apple’s expansion has been driven by employees bringing in their own devices and requesting corporate support, the so-called bring-your-own-IT trend. Hooking up with IBM may help address lingering concerns about smartphone software security and data privacy, in the form of a veteran partner that’s led in enterprise IT for decades. “This deal is a very targeted attempt by Apple with the help from IBM to focus on the enterprise, corporate market which has really been the main business of Blackberry,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York.

But the major U.S. stock indexes closed well above session lows with the Dow Jones industrial average erasing all of its earlier losses. In the monetary policy report accompanying her congressional testimony, Yellen said that “equity valuations of smaller firms as well as social media and biotechnology firms appear to be stretched.” The Russell 2000 small-cap index dropped 1 percent and the Global X Social Media ETF slid 1.1 percent. Facebook shares tumbled 1.1 percent to $67.17. Twitter Inc shares slid 1.1 percent to $37.88. “These are the sub-industries that have caused a lot of longtime stock watchers to scratch their heads,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. “Looking at some of these things and trying to figure out their value, it felt like the 2000 Internet bubble all over again,” Forrest added. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 5.26 points or 0.03 percent, to end at 17,060.68, not far below the record closing high of 17,068.26 set on July 3. The S&P; 500 slipped 3.82 points or 0.19 percent, to  1,973.28, about 12 points below its record closing high of 1,985.44 set on July 3. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 24.03 points or 0.54 percent, to close at 4,416.39. According to the BofA Merrill Lynch Fund Manager Survey for July, 61 percent of global asset managers are overweight equities, the highest reading since early 2011, but 21 percent see stock markets as overvalued, the highest reading since 2000. BlackBerry’s U.S.-listed shares plunged 4 percent to $10.85 after the bell following news that International Business Machines Corp will partner exclusively with Apple Inc to sell iPhones and iPads loaded with applications intended to serve corporate clients. “This deal is a very targeted attempt by Apple with help from IBM to focus on the enterprise corporate market, which has really been the main business of Blackberry,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. After the bell, IBM’s stock rose 1.9 percent and Apple shares rose 1.3 percent. Shares of Yahoo Inc rose 2.7 percent in extended-hours trading after the Internet company reported a decline in second-quarter net revenue. During the regular session, shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co  jumped 3.5 percent to $58.27 and helped lift the Dow. The stock rallied after JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, when ranked by assets, reported a drop in second-quarter profit, although the profit exceeded the average analysts’ estimate. The bank also reported a decline in revenue, but the drop was not as steep as JPMorgan had forecast in May. Shares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc gained 1.3 percent to $169.17 after the company reported a 5 percent increase in second-quarter profit. Higher revenue from stock underwriting helped Goldman’s bottom line. But the stock of Johnson & Johnson, another Dow component, fell 2 percent to $103.28. The diversified healthcare and consumer products company reported higher-than-expected quarterly results on sizzling sales of Olysio, its new  treatment for hepatitis C. The company, however, cautioned that the new pill’s sales will lose momentum later this year as new rivals come to market. S&P; 500 companies’ profits are expected to grow 5.2 percent in the second quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data, down from the 8.4 percent growth forecast at the start of April. Revenue is seen up 3.2 percent. About 6 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, above the 5.32 billion average for the month to date, according to data from BATS Global Markets.

VMware said on Tuesday it will work with China Telecom to build a hybrid cloud service to be operated by the state-owned company, China’s biggest cloud service provider. Hybrid services can be used to combine private infrastructure such as on-premises data centers with public cloud services. U.S. equipment and software providers such as IBM Corp and Cisco Systems Inc have seen their China sales drop after last year’s revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden of U.S. spying.  “To us, we think about Snowden, we think about these allegations going back and forth, and it’s disappointing,” VMware Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger said in an interview on Tuesday following announcements of partnerships with China Telecom and Japan’s SoftBank Corp. He said, however, that allowing China Telecom to sell products under its own brand made it easier to do business in China. “In the face of that bigger negative aura, we do a huge partnership with China Telecom. It emphasizes that we can be partner-led, it doesn’t have to be our brand on our service.” VMware, owned 80 percent EMC Corp, will provide the software stack to be operated by China Telecom, which will target sales of hybrid cloud services to large and mid-sized companies as well as government departments in China’s fast-growing cloud computing market.

596,IBM,"UPDATE 1-Apple-IBM deal dents BlackBerry's prospects, slams stock","(Adds analyst comment; updates share prices) By Euan Rocha TORONTO, July 16 (Reuters) - BlackBerry Ltd’s  shares took a beating on Wednesday after IBM Corp  outlined plans to partner with Apple Inc to sell iPhones and iPads loaded with applications for business users. The Apple-IBM tie up, beginning this fall, is set to target the customer base that BlackBerry needs to woo as part of a turnaround under new Chief Executive Officer John Chen. “It is not a crushing blow at this early stage, but it is a negative for BlackBerry,” said IDC analyst John Jackson. “There can be little question that it is unwelcome, if not entirely unexpected news.” BlackBerry’s stock has been on a tear this year. As of Tuesday, it was up more than 50 percent as some investors  became more optimistic about the company’s future. News of the Apple-IBM venture took some of the steam out of the stock on Wednesday. BlackBerry shares fell 9.4 percent to $10.24 on Nasdaq and 9.3 percent to C$11.03 on the Toronto Stock Exchange after analysts said the alliance could hurt the turnaround plans. IBM said late Tuesday the tie-up will offer services geared toward security and mobile device management, an area viewed as BlackBerry’s strong suit and a key selling point in its battle to win back market share from the iPhone and devices powered by Google Inc’s Android software. “The partnership’s software around data security and device management pose immediate threats to mobile device management (MDM) software solutions deployed by firms such as BlackBerry and MobileIron,” said Morningstar analyst Brian Colello in a note to clients. “Even if Apple-IBM’s security ‘mousetrap’ isn’t as good as ones offered by BlackBerry and others, these MDM vendors will have to overcome the extremely high hurdle of displacing IBM’s mobile device software preloaded on iPhones and iPads.” BlackBerry downplayed the threat posed by the alliance. “The news that Apple is partnering with IBM to expand into the enterprise mobility market only underscores the ongoing need for secure end-to-end enterprise mobility solutions like those BlackBerry has delivered for years,” said the company in a brief statement. BlackBerry said it remained the leader in this market, with the necessary software and network to secure data for enterprise clients. UBS analyst Amitabh Passi warned, however, that competition for Blackberry in the enterprise mobile management market is set to intensify after recent deals such as IBM’s acquisition of Fiberlink, VMware’s takeover of AirWatch and the Citrix-Zenprise deal. “Blackberry now finds itself competing against much larger and established enterprise vendors, as well as smaller, but better capitalized vendors like Mobileiron,” said Passi in a note to clients. The shares of Mobileiron Inc, a small recently listed player in the sector, also fell sharply - down nearly 6 percent at $8.16 in afternoon trading on Wednesday.

The company’s software business revenue grew 1 percent in the quarter to $6.5 billion, slower than forecasts of 3 percent, as it signed fewer contracts than expected. “We expect acceleration of software revenue to mid-single digits in second half of 2014,” IBM Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter said on a conference call after the results were released. IBM, the world’s largest technology company, has been attempting to restructure its business to focus on high-end products like Cloud, mobile security and Big Data.

In January, IBM sold its customer care business, which brought in approximately $1.2 billion in full year revenue in 2013, to hardware distributor Synnex Corp, a sale the company expects to negatively affect revenue comparisons by $300 million per quarter.

Investors sold stocks in a move to avoid risk and poured  money into safe-haven investments like gold and U.S. government bonds as the crash stoked concerns that the conflict in Ukraine might widen after U.S. sanctions against Russia were announced late Wednesday. The United States said the Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 was “blown out of the sky,” probably by a ground-launched missile. The jet had 295 people aboard. The crash followed an increase in tensions between Ukraine and Russia that has resulted in clashes along the border, including the targeting of military aircraft. Further pressuring the market, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday instructed the military to begin a ground offensive in Gaza, an official statement from his office said. Reuters witnesses and Gaza residents reported heavy artillery and naval shelling and helicopter fire along the Gaza border. “I can’t remember a time when there were more geopolitical skirmishes going on, all of which are creating uncertainty,” said Michael Mullaney, chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust Co in Boston. “We were already ripe for a correction, but I’m putting today into the ‘noise’ category for now, since we need to see whether there is follow-through to this move.” The Dow Jones industrial average fell 161.39 points or 0.94 percent, to end at 16,976.81. The S&P; 500 lost 23.45 points or 1.18 percent, to 1,958.12. The Nasdaq Composite  dropped 62.52 points or 1.41 percent, to 4,363.45. The CBOE Volatility Index, Wall Street’s fear gauge, surged 32.2 percent to 14.54, its highest level since April 15. After the closing bell, shares of Google Inc rose 1.6 percent. The stock’s jump followed news that Nikesh Arora, the Internet search company’s chief business officer - one of Chief Executive Officer Larry Page’s key lieutenants and the company’s main liaison to Wall Street - is leaving, the latest high-ranking executive to depart. Arora’s surprise departure was announced as Google reported results that beat investors’ expectations. Shares of International Business Machines Corp fell 1.3 percent in extended-hours trading after the company reported higher-than-expected quarterly revenue and earnings per share. The improvement in IBM’s results occurred as the company continued to shift to higher-end businesses such as big data, cloud computing, and security and mobile services. During the regular session, the NYSE Arca airline index  fell 2.6 percent. Shares of most major U.S. carriers slid, with American Airlines Group Inc down 4.1 percent at $41.70 and United Continental Holdings Inc down 3.5 percent at $43.35. The Market Vectors Russia exchange-traded fund fell 7.2 percent on consolidated volume of 7.4 million shares. The major U.S. stock indexes had opened slightly lower. Equities held near the unchanged mark and the Dow briefly turned positive, hitting an intraday record high at 17,151.56 in early morning trading after solid earnings from companies such as Morgan Stanley and UnitedHealth. Morgan Stanley’s stock slipped 0.6 percent to end at $32.30. Shares of UnitedHealth Group Inc rose 1.6 percent to $85.11. By late morning, though, stocks skidded to session lows after news of the Malaysian plane crash. Going against the day’s sharp downtrend was Microsoft Corp , which rose 1 percent to $44.53. The stock rallied after Microsoft said it would cut up to 18,000 jobs, or about 14 percent of its workforce, resulting in pre-tax charges of $1.1 billion to $1.6 billion over the next four quarters. About 6.63 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, above the 5.48 billion average for the month to date, according to data from BATS Global Markets.

602,IBM,Pratt & Whitney hires IBM to gather and analyze engine data,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Engine maker Pratt & Whitney will partner with International Business Machines Corp to compile and analyze data from about 4,000 commercial aircraft engines in order to be able to predict trouble before problems arise, the company announced on Thursday. The announcement comes as more aircraft engine suppliers tune in to data analytics to increase safety and reduce costs. In 2012, IBM rival Accenture partnered with GE Aviation to launch a similar offering that allows airlines to chart fuel-efficient flight paths and decrease hold times at landings. Pratt & Whitney, a subsidiary of United Technologies Corp, said in a statement it has hired IBM to analyze the half terabyte of data that engines generate on every flight to detect and predict engine trouble.  “Rather than reacting to some sort of an engine event, we are leveraging data from various sources for maintenance, for planning engine diagnostic systems and building predictive models,” Jerry Kurtz, vice president of strategy and analytics at IBM, said. A typical engine overhaul can cost between $3 million and $10 million. Using IBM’s data analytics, Pratt & Whitney expects to prolong engine life to up to six years from the current four to five and reduce maintenance costs by up to 20 percent, said Jim Pennito, director of service programs at Pratt & Whitney. Through the partnership, which has been in the works for a year and half, IBM will analyze the massive amounts of data already generated from engines on the field and flag those that have the highest risk of presenting problems in the near future for proactive maintenance.  “The focus is to be a lot smarter and efficient in how we overhaul engines. Customers should see that in less disruptions, and removals, and when the engine is in the shop, targeted repairs so the engine can come out of the shop quickly,” Pennito said.

Technology and consumer finance stocks ranked among the day’s biggest gainers. At the top of the pack, shares of Google  jumped 4.1 percent to $604.62 a day after the company reported second-quarter results that beat investors’ expectations. Facebook Inc shares gained 2.6 percent to $68.15. Market participants kept a close watch on geopolitical news. U.S. President Barack Obama demanded that Russia stop supporting separatists in eastern Ukraine after the downing of a Malaysian airline by a surface-to-air missile he said was fired from rebel territory raised the prospect of more sanctions on Moscow. Investors also remained wary after Israel stepped up its land offensive in Gaza on Friday. “As a market participant, what’s more concerning to me are the latest round of U.S. sanctions on Russia. If the EU follows the U.S. and ratchets up pressure on Russia, what will happen to bonds of Russian companies such as Gazprom and Rosneft?” said Putri Pascualy, credit strategist and portfolio manager at Pacific Alternative Asset Management Co. in Irvine, California. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 117.29 points or 0.69 percent, to 17,094.10. The S&P; 500 gained 18.91 points or 0.97 percent, to 1,977.03.

The CBOE Volatility Index plunged 16.4 percent to 12.16 - a day after surging 32 percent to 14.54, which was its biggest jump since April 2013. The VIX still remains well below its historical average of around 20. General Electric shares shed 0.9 percent to $26.37 after the U.S. conglomerate reported growth in second-quarter operating earnings that matched analysts’ expectations. Fellow Dow component International Business Machines Corp  slightly lost ground, down 0.1 percent at $192.32, a day after the world’s largest technology company reported its software business grew less than expected even as quarterly earnings beat analysts’ expectations.

Market participants will keep a close eye on geopolitical tensions, as the United States said Friday it could not rule out that Russia may have assisted separatists in firing a missile that likely downed a Malaysian airliner Thursday at the Ukraine-Russia border, killing nearly 300 people. Investors were also wary as Israel began a Gaza ground campaign on Thursday.

608,IBM,"RPT-With sales sputtering, Apple's iPad looks to IBM alliance","(Repeats with no change) By Christina  Farr SAN FRANCISCO, July 22 (Reuters) - Apple Inc’s iPad is losing steam just four years after its release, but an alliance with International Business Machines Corp could rejuvenate a flagging product by entering into a largely untapped corporate market. Apple shipped 13.2 million iPads in the June quarter, 8 percent fewer than a year earlier and lagging Wall Street’s forecast for 14 million or more. Sales of the device, which accounted for 15 percent of revenue, fell short of Wall Street’s expectations for the second quarter in a row. Apple helped create the tablet market in 2010 with its first iPad. But growth has plummeted from 2012, as larger phones became more popular and people delayed replacing their tablets. And it is ceding market to mostly cheaper Android offerings from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Chinese manufacturers using Google Inc software. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook described iPad sales as “very bifurcated” - they continue to grow at 50 percent or above in emerging markets such as the Middle East and China, but in developed countries like the United States, the “market is weaker.” Research firm IDC lowered its forecast for 2014 worldwide tablet demand growth to 12.1 percent - a fraction of the 51.8 percent expansion of 2013. The first quarter of this year also saw Apple’s market share slide to 32.5 percent, from 40 percent a year earlier. “The tablet market globally has really hit a wall,” said Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Brian White. Another threat to iPad sales may come from within. Apple is expected to introduce a larger 5.5-inch (14.0-cm) iPhone in the fall. At those dimensions, the iPhone would begin closing in on the 7.8-inch (19.8-cm) iPad mini. “You have the negative impact of the larger screen iPhone and what that would do to iPad mini,” said Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster. “You’re going to get a larger screen iPhone before you’ll get contributions from the IBM partnership.” Investors hope the partnership with IBM announced this month will help bolster sales in the largest global enterprises, which could provide a boon to U.S. tablet sales. Cook cited IDC figures showing that iPad penetration among businesses stood at about 20 percent, versus 60 percent for notebook computers. Analysts say the alliance, in which the two companies will work on a suite of secure business apps, may take years to show up in the bottom line. But they see potential in marrying IBM’s business-software expertise with Apple’s hardware and services. “I do believe Apple can leverage IBM’s channel,” said White. Growth areas include the retail sector, where employees may increasingly use tablets for inventory management, as well as financial services, and transportation, he said. Other promising sectors included education and healthcare. “We see the importance of the customer ... and both feel that mobile and enterprise is just an enormous opportunity,” Cook, a former IBM executive himself, said on a conference call. “And we’re not competing with each other so a partnership in that case is particularly great.”   (Reporting by Christina Farr and Edwin Chan; Editing by Mohammad Zargham)",7232014,http://www.reuters.com/article/apple-results-ipad/rpt-with-sales-sputtering-apples-ipad-looks-to-ibm-alliance-idUSL2N0PX2VL20140723

614,IBM,"Dell, BlackBerry downplay threat from Apple-IBM alliance","TORONTO (Reuters) - IBM Corp’s recent move to partner with Apple Inc to sell iPhones and iPads loaded with corporate applications has excited investors in both companies, but two rivals say they are unperturbed for now. Top executives at Dell and BlackBerry Ltd scoffed at the threat posed by the alliance this week, arguing the tie-up is unlikely to derail the efforts of their own companies to re-invent themselves. “I do not think that we take the Apple-IBM tie-up terribly seriously. I think it just made a good press release,” John Swainson, who heads Dell’s global software business, said in an interview with Reuters in Toronto on Thursday.  PC maker Dell and smartphone maker BlackBerry are in the midst of reshaping their companies around software and services, as the needs of their big corporate clients morph.  Swainson, who spent over two decades in senior roles at IBM, said, “I have some trouble understanding how IBM reps are going to really help Apple very much in terms of introducing devices into their accounts. I mean candidly, they weren’t very good at doing it when it was IBM-logoed products, so I do not get how introducing Apple-logoed stuff is going to be much better.” While conceding that Apple products hold more allure, Swainson said they lack the depth of security features that many large business clients like banks covet. IBM and Apple could not immediately be reached for comment. BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen similarly downplayed the threat of the alliance in an interview with the Financial Times on Thursday, likening the tie-up to when “two elephants start dancing.”      Dell and BlackBerry declined to discuss whether they would consider teaming up, but some analysts, bankers and others have argued in the past that a partnership between the two underdogs potentially made sense. Texas-based Dell has a huge sales team, vast network of business clients and is focused on growing its security and device management capabilities, long strong suits for BlackBerry. The Canadian company is building on its heritage by adding capabilities to manage not just BlackBerry, but iOS-, Android- and Windows-based devices on its infrastructure.  “Dell’s always been in a partnership-driven model. As Dell has evolved it has focused on some pieces of the equation, but not all,” said Swainson, adding that the need to broaden partnerships is growing, but declining comment on a potential tie-up with BlackBerry. Chen told the Financial Times that BlackBerry was in early discussions with some companies about working together in parts of the enterprise market, but did not name them. Whether a BlackBerry-Dell partnership will materialize is unclear for now. Initial speculation about a tie-up between the two began a year ago, when both players were exploring buyouts. At the time, one source told Reuters that BlackBerry had held talks with private equity firm Silver Lake Partners about collaboration in enterprise computing.  Silver Lake, along with Dell’s founder, Michael Dell, were at the time in the midst of taking Dell private.  At the time, the source said if the buyout succeeded, one option was a collaboration with BlackBerry in mobile computing. Both Swainson and Chen were senior advisors with Silver Lake before moving into their roles with Dell and BlackBerry. BlackBerry, under the leadership of Chen, has been busy forging alliances and earlier this week announced it was going to allow third-parties to host its device management services.

BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen similarly downplayed the threat of the alliance in an interview with the Financial Times on Thursday, likening the tie-up to when “two elephants start dancing.” Dell and BlackBerry declined to discuss whether they would consider teaming up, but some analysts, bankers and others have argued in the past that a partnership between the two underdogs potentially made sense. Texas-based Dell has a huge sales team, vast network of business clients and is focused on growing its security and device management capabilities, long strong suits for BlackBerry. The Canadian company is building on its heritage by adding capabilities to manage not just BlackBerry, but iOS-, Android- and Windows-based devices on its infrastructure. “Dell’s always been in a partnership-driven model. As Dell has evolved it has focused on some pieces of the equation, but not all,” said Swainson, adding that the need to broaden partnerships is growing, but declining comment on a potential tie-up with BlackBerry. Chen told the Financial Times that BlackBerry was in early discussions with some companies about working together in parts of the enterprise market, but did not name them. Whether a BlackBerry-Dell partnership will materialize is unclear for now. Initial speculation about a tie-up between the two began a year ago, when both players were exploring buyouts. At the time, one source told Reuters that BlackBerry had held talks with private equity firm Silver Lake Partners about collaboration in enterprise computing. Silver Lake, along with Dell’s founder, Michael Dell, were at the time in the midst of taking Dell private. At the time, the source said if the buyout succeeded, one option was a collaboration with BlackBerry in mobile computing. Both Swainson and Chen were senior advisors with Silver Lake before moving into their roles with Dell and BlackBerry. BlackBerry, under the leadership of Chen, has been busy forging alliances and earlier this week announced it was going to allow third-parties to host its device management services.

617,IBM,"UPDATE 1-Act now on climate change or see costs soar, White House says","(Adds comment from Republican lawmaker, paragraphs 7-8) By Roberta Rampton WASHINGTON, July 29 (Reuters) - Putting off expensive measures to curb climate change will only cost the United States more in the long run, the White House said on Tuesday in a report meant to bolster a series of actions President Barack Obama has proposed to address global warming. “Each decade we delay acting results in an added cost of dealing with the problem of an extra 40 percent,” said Jason Furman, chairman of Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers. “We know way more than enough to justify acting today,” Furman told reporters. The report drew its conclusions from 16 economic studies that modeled the costs of climate change. It was released as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency holds public hearings on its plan to cut carbon emissions from power plants - the centerpiece of Obama’s climate action plan. Business groups have said the EPA’s plan would hurt jobs in the coal sector and harm the U.S. economy, but the White House and environmental groups have pushed back against that argument. Last month, a bipartisan report commissioned by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and environmentalist Tom Steyer forecast a multibillion-dollar price tag for climate costs, such as property losses from storms, declining crop yields and soaring power bills during heatwaves. At a Senate budget committee hearing on Tuesday examining the costs of not addressing climate change, Republican Senator Jeff Sessions said the United States must also weigh the consequences of acting on climate. “Inaction costs may be real, but certainly they are distant and somewhat uncertain,” said Sessions, the top Republican on the panel. “Every global warming action has costs and we must acknowledge those costs and decide whether the wealth expended gets the maximum results considering all the needs of America.” The Obama administration plans to make additional climate announcements on Tuesday. U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz is set to announce actions by his department to reduce methane emissions from the natural gas transmission and distribution system, along with partnerships and “stakeholder commitments,” the White House said. This fall, the administration is set to propose new rules to cut methane emissions from oil and gas wells on public lands, and also will decide whether to propose regulations to address emissions from operations on private land, said Dan Utech, special assistant to the president for energy and climate change. The administration also will announce partnerships with IBM Corp, Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp, Coca-Cola Co and others to use data to help make agriculture and food production more resilient to climate change, the White House said.

619,IBM,"UPDATE 1-Symantec, Kaspersky downplay Beijing effort to exclude products","(Adds Kaspersky and analysts’ comments) By Soham Chatterjee and Jim Finkle Aug 4 (Reuters) - U.S. security software maker Symantec Corp  and Russia’s Kaspersky Lab downplayed a move by Beijing to exclude them from a list of anti-virus vendors whose products are approved for sale to central government agencies in China. The People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the ruling Communist Party, said on its English Twitter feed on Sunday that the government’s procurement agency has excluded Symantec and Kaspersky from a list of security software suppliers. Kaspersky confirmed on Monday that authorities in Beijing had moved to restrict government purchases of software from non-Chinese companies. “Chinese Central Government Procurement Center temporarily rescinded its endorsements of all foreign security providers,” Kaspersky spokeswoman Susan Rivera said. “However, this restriction only applies to national-level institutions whose funding comes from the central government procurement budget, and does not include regional governments or large enterprises.” Symantec said in a statement that the list referred to in Chinese media reports only affected some types of products. “It is important to note that this list is only for certain types of procurement and Symantec products are not banned by the Chinese government,” the statement said.  “We are investigating this report and will continue to bid for and win government projects in China.” Shares of Symantec closed up 1.7 percent at $23.56 on the Nasdaq on Monday. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.72 percent. The People’s Daily also tweeted that it had approved the use of five Chinese anti-virus software vendors: Qihoo 360 Technology Co, Venustech, CAJinchen, Beijing Jiangmin and Rising. FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said he sees the development becoming a more contentious issue over the coming months. “It’s another headwind for the company as Symantec already faces numerous challenges to show growth again. China remains a headache situation for Symantec as well as other U.S. tech providers across the board.” Ives said. Symantec said last month it was in talks with Chinese authorities following reports that China had banned use of one of its products, data loss prevention software. Sunday’s report is the latest sign that Beijing is intent on promoting use of domestic information technology amid concerns about U.S. spying and the indictment of five Chinese military officers on cyber espionage charges. Still, Eric Johnson, dean of the business school at Vanderbilt University and an expert on cyber security issues, said the Chinese government’s move is only a “symbolic one” and will have “little meaningful impact” on Symantec. Chinese technology corporations like Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and ZTE Corp have grown into sophisticated global conglomerates in past years, and some analysts speculate that Beijing is promoting its local industry standard-bearers on its own home turf at the expense of U.S. corporations. Chinese state media have lashed out at Google Inc, Apple Inc and other U.S. technology companies, calling on Beijing “to punish severely the pawns” of the U.S. government for monitoring China and stealing secrets. U.S. tech companies such as Microsoft Corp and Qualcomm Inc have recently faced anti-trust investigations, while IBM Corp and Cisco Systems Inc  have reported declining sales in China.

622,IBM,IBM unveils 'brain-like' chip that can interpret complex data,"WASHINGTON, Aug 7 (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp unveiled a “brain-like” computer chip on Thursday that is the size of a postage stamp and capable of processing massive amounts of data while handling inputs from many different sources, the company said. The announcement comes one month after IBM unveiled a $3 billion investment over the next five years in chip research and development to find a game-changing breakthrough that can help revive its slumping hardware unit. Unlike most chips, which operate on pre written paths, IBM’s version processes data in realtime and is capable of dealing with ambiguity, the company said. It runs on the energy equivalent of a hearing aid. Built on Samsung Electro-Mechanics Co Ltd’s 28nm process technology, the chip only consumes 70mW of energy. A product of almost a decade of research, the chip aims to bridge the divide between existing computers and the brain’s high cognitive power and low energy use. “After years of collaboration with IBM, we are now a step closer to building a computer similar to our brain,” said Professor Rajit Manohar at Cornell Tech, where the chip was designed. The chip contains one million programmable neurons and could allow a thermometer to scan and smell chemical signals and deliver a diagnosis, or help a search and rescue robot to identify people in need during a disaster, the company said. IBM hopes it can integrate multi-sensory processing into mobile devices and says the chip can handle future advances in memory, 3G integration, logic and sensor technologies.

Under the new software deployment model, financial data provider Shanghai Wind Information will send publicly available data to IBM’s cloud for risk analysis without having to disclose specific portfolio holdings or having to install IBM software or hardware on its servers. “This is an innovative deployment model in that IBM never receives client information,” Andrew Aziz, IBM’s director of risk analytics, said in an interview. Aziz added that the new business model “continues to comply with the local laws, including data privacy laws in China and in all countries in which it operates.” The new deployment model underscores the challenges facing U.S. technology companies in China following Edward Snowden’s revelations of extensive U.S. government spying and security vulnerabilities in American-made hardware. Citing national security concerns, the Chinese government has encouraged its state enterprises to wean themselves off foreign hardware suppliers and reportedly ordered state banks to pull out their IBM gear earlier this year. IBM has been particularly targeted due to the sensitive and critical role its servers play in practically every major industry from banking to energy. IBM executives on Thursday declined to discuss the company’s business in China more broadly but said they believed the new cloud-based deployment model would help it succeed in the market. The company disclosed in April that sales in China fell 20 percent in the first quarter, and executives have repeatedly sought to reassure investors that the IBM’s future in the country remained positive with a series of partnership agreements with Chinese agencies. IBM said in July it would donate $100 million in big data software and provide technical training at 100 Chinese universities as part of an major agreement with China’s Ministry of Education.

Since last year Inspur has aggressively marketed its servers to Chinese state-owned firms as a replacement for IBM (International Business Machines Corp) systems while U.S.-China relations have worsened dramatically over mutual suspicions of cyber-spying. Inspur shares soared in late May after it told Chinese news outlets that its servers had begun to replace the U.S. company’s equipment in large financial institutions and would completely supplant IBM in China in due course. The Chinese firm has coined the term “I2I” - IBM to Inspur - as a marketing catchphrase. In marketing materials distributed this year and seen by Reuters, Inspur extensively cited the threat of U.S. cyber-aggression and the role of servers in national security. The two companies made no mention of cyber-security on Friday when they announced that IBM would make its DB2 database software and Websphere application software available for use on Inspur’s line of K1 servers.  IBM will also make available its POWER8 processors and support chips to help Inspur’s development, while providing other technical assistance, the companies said. In statements, Inspur Chairman Sun Pishu and IBM Greater China head D.C. Chien both pledged greater future collaboration.

629,IBM,ICBC deal shows U.S. tech giant IBM still engaged in China,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC)(601398.SS) has deployed a new IBM (IBM.N) mainframe computer system, the two companies said on Tuesday, boosting the U.S. technology giant’s credentials in the country. IBM’s joint announcement with ICBC, the world’s largest bank by market capitalization, shows IBM is still doing business with China’s state-owned banks despite widely circulated media reports in May that suggested China’s central government had ordered banks to remove IBM equipment because of cyber security concerns. The U.S. company’s efforts to repair any public relations damage have included the announcement in recent weeks of a string of deals in China to assure investors of its future in the market and salvage its reputation with other potential Chinese buyers. In a statement released only in Chinese, ICBC chief technology officer Lin Xiaoxuan said that ICBC was the first bank in mainland China to introduce IBM mainframes 30 years ago and that they have since played an “important role” in the bank’s IT operations”. “IBM mainframes have consistently helped us keep our IT systems steady and safe and will continue to do so in the future,” Lin said. ICBC’s newly deployed mainframe, which was purchased from IBM several months ago, allows sensitive financial data to be routed around the world in the event of a crash at one of its 40 global branches. Beijing-based Forrester analyst Gene Cao said that the Chinese government would like to reduce its banks’ dependence on foreign technology but added that his conversations with IT officials at large banks lead him to believe that the reports about an IBM ban were overblown. These officials have expressed concern that the outcry to push out IOE - the moniker in China for Western tech giants IBM, Oracle and EMC - could hamper their business, Cao said. “Perpetuating rumors that there’s a ban on IOE would pose a risk for the banks, too, and I don’t think they necessarily want that,” Cao added. IBM Greater China Chief D.C. Chien told the state-run China Daily newspaper in a recent interview that local banks have continued to purchase its products. IBM additionally announced this week that it would team up with China Telecom (0728.HK) to provide cloud computing services to small and medium-sized businesses. Before the most recent public relations push, IBM said in April that sales in China had fallen by 20 percent, echoing disappointing results from many U.S. technology companies that suffered plummeting sales in China after revelations by Edward Snowden of extensive U.S. government spying. In an unexpected development, Inspur, a Chinese rival to IBM that marketed itself as a more secure option for Chinese banks, announced this week that it will sell its high-end K1 server system with IBM’s database and web application software installed.

ICBC’s newly deployed mainframe, which was purchased from IBM several months ago, allows sensitive financial data to be routed around the world in the event of a crash at one of its 40 global branches. Beijing-based Forrester analyst Gene Cao said that the Chinese government would like to reduce its banks’ dependence on foreign technology but added that his conversations with IT officials at large banks lead him to believe that the reports about an IBM ban were overblown. These officials have expressed concern that the outcry to push out IOE - the moniker in China for Western tech giants IBM, Oracle and EMC - could hamper their business, Cao said. “Perpetuating rumours that there’s a ban on IOE would pose a risk for the banks, too, and I don’t think they necessarily want that,” Cao added. IBM Greater China Chief D.C. Chien told the state-run China Daily newspaper in a recent interview that local banks have continued to purchase its products. IBM additionally announced this week that it would team up with China Telecom to provide cloud computing services to small and medium-sized businesses. Before the most recent public relations push, IBM said in April that sales in China had fallen by 20 percent, echoing disappointing results from many U.S. technology companies that suffered plummeting sales in China after revelations by Edward Snowden of extensive U.S. government spying. In an unexpected development, Inspur, a Chinese rival to IBM that marketed itself as a more secure option for Chinese banks, announced this week that it will sell its high-end K1 server system with IBM’s database and web application software installed.

IBM’s joint announcement with ICBC, the world’s largest bank by market capitalization, is an effort to signal IBM’s ongoing business with China’s state-owned banks and comes several months after widely circulated media reports suggested China’s central government had ordered banks to remove IBM equipment due to cybersecurity concerns.

633,IBM,"Ford, IBM win dismissal of 12-year lawsuit over apartheid abuses","NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Manhattan federal judge has dismissed a 12-year-old lawsuit accusing Ford Motor Co (F.N) and IBM Corp (IBM.N) of encouraging human rights abuses in apartheid-era South Africa, reluctantly concluding that the case does not belong in U.S. courts. U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin on Thursday said the black South Africans who brought the case did not show “relevant conduct” by Ford and IBM within the United States to justify holding the companies liable. The plaintiffs had accused Ford, IBM and other companies of having between the 1970s and early 1990s aided South Africa’s former apartheid government in abuses such as killings and torture, by having made military vehicles and computers for government security forces. “That these plaintiffs are left without relief in an American court is regrettable,” Scheindlin wrote. “But I am bound to follow [legal precedent], no matter what my personal view of the law may be.” The case had been brought under the Alien Tort Statute, a 1789 law that lets non-U.S. citizens pursue some cases in U.S. courts over alleged violations of international law. In April 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court said that law was presumed to cover only violations in the United States, or violations elsewhere that “touch and concern” U.S. territory “with sufficient force.” Four months later, the federal appeals court in Manhattan applied that holding, and said the Ford and IBM cases should be dismissed altogether. In April, Scheindlin nonetheless gave the plaintiffs one more chance, to meet the new standards imposed by those higher courts.  But in Thursday’s decision, she said the bar proved too high, and that any alleged international law violations were by Ford’s and IBM’s South African units, and occurred abroad. “It has been 12 years. We’re really disappointed, devastated by the decision,” said Diane Sammons, a partner at Nagel Rice in Roseland, New Jersey, who represents some plaintiffs. “The end result of the ruling is that corporations can act abroad with impunity, even if they’re totally controlling the activities of their foreign subsidiaries,” she added. “I don’t think the Supreme Court’s decision was that narrowly defined.” She said the plaintiffs had not decided whether to appeal. Jonathan Hacker, an O’Melveny & Myers partner who represents Ford, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Keith Hummel, a Cravath, Swaine & Moore partner who represents IBM, did not immediately respond to similar requests.

637,IBM,"Tech, equipment makers join U.S. 'net neutrality' debate","LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Regulating internet providers more like public utility companies could hurt the Internet and the U.S. economy, more than two dozen network technology and equipment makers have told U.S. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker. Thirty-three companies including Cisco Systems Inc, Intel Corp and International Business Machines Corp joined the chorus of citizens, activists, lawmakers and companies debating how the U.S. government should regulate Internet service providers (ISPs). Other companies signing a letter to Pritzker published on Tuesday included Alcatel Lucent SA, Ericsson, Nokia Oyj’s network arm NSN, Panasonic Corp of North America and CommScope Holding Co Inc. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is considering so-called “net neutrality” rules that would determine how ISPs such as Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc manage web traffic on their networks. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has proposed rules that would allow ISPs to charge content companies to ensure their websites or applications load smoothly and quickly, as long as such deals are deemed “commercially reasonable.”  Critics, including popular video streaming service Netflix Corp and numerous advocacy groups, argue the plan would threaten less deep-pocketed content providers by potentially relegating them to “slow lanes” on the web. Instead, they call on the FCC to reclassify broadband as a telecommunication service rather than the less-regulated information service it is now, saying the move would give more power to the FCC to stop potential violators of net neutrality. ISPs and Republicans, both in Congress and at the FCC, have rejected the idea.  On Tuesday, 33 telecom network and tech makers, who are members of the Telecommunications Industry Association and the National Cable and Telecommunications Association and who depend on ISPs for business, spoke out against the reclassification idea as well. “A sudden shift from the existing light-touch approach – which has been an unqualified success and the basis for billions of dollars in investments – to the prescriptive regime of Title II would be extremely disruptive to the broadband marketplace,” they wrote, referring to the legal authority the FCC would use to reclassify ISPs. Experts have disagreed on whether or how reclassification would adequately prevent pay-for-priority deals.  Wheeler has not proposed reclassification as the solution, but has not taken it off the table as a potential option. FCC is collecting public comment on the tentatively proposed rules until Sept. 15 and will hold several public workshops on various aspects of the regulations in the following weeks. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy will hold a hearing on the issue of net neutrality on Sept. 17.

638,IBM,"For U.S. tech firms, China entices in spite of tight state control","TIANJIN, CHINA Sept 12 (Reuters) - The sheer size of the Chinese market is so alluring to Western companies that even pro-internet freedom firms like CloudFlare may have to put moral outrage to the side in their pursuit of new business. San Francisco-based CloudFlare has a policy of providing cyber-defence services for all, based on a belief that the internet should be free, decentralised and open. Its clients have included groups that the U.S. government regards as terrorist organisations. Those values may now have to be shelved when it comes to entering China, where state control of the internet is among the world’s tightest. CloudFlare is looking for a Chinese partner and aims to be in the country by 2015, said co-founder Michelle Zatlyn on the sidelines of a World Economic Forum meeting in the northern city of Tianjin this week. “As we think about international expansion it’s vital that we get China,” said Zatlyn of CloudFlare’s second-largest market by user traffic. “There are rules and regulation which operate within the country. As a U.S. company we absolutely have to follow those, and we’re okay with that.” The operating environment in China may be even tougher now. U.S. businesses have complained about Chinese protectionism, and American tech firms have repeatedly come under fire from the state since last year’s U.S. National Security Agency cyber espionage revelations. Microsoft Corp and Qualcomm Inc are being investigated for anti-trust violations, while IBM Corp, Intel Corp and Cisco Systems Inc have seen sales in China plummet in recent quarters. CloudFlare is joining a long list of companies, from firms that have seen little or no success in China like Yahoo Inc , eBay Inc, Google Inc and Facebook Inc  to recent entrants like LinkedIn Corp, for whom China’s pull as the world’s largest internet market by population has been too strong to resist. CloudFlare is hoping to learn from the lessons of the U.S. tech sector’s fallen soldiers in China. One of these came at the World Economic Forum, where Lu Wei, the director of China’s State Internet Information Office, said Facebook will be unable to access China any time soon, according to state media. “You have to play a slightly long game if you’re a Western multi-national company in China,” said Mark Spelman, a managing director at Accenture PLC. “It’s very important to think about which Chinese partners you should be working with, and organisations need to think very  carefully about what business model you need in China - it might not be the same as in other countries,” he cautioned.

Shares in the company fell as much as 7 percent in early trade on Monday. The company, which provides payment solutions to 350 financial institutions, said loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization widened to 31.4 million pounds ($51 million) for the year ended June 30. Revenue rose 31 percent to 95.1 million pounds. Monitise had in July lowered its revenue growth estimate to a range of 31-33 percent from 50 percent, citing a shift in its revenue model. The company reiterated its outlook for revenue growth of at least 25 percent in 2015 and that it would be EBITDA profitable in 2016. Monitise derives about 50 percent of its revenue from the UK and 40 percent from the United States. “A lot of our systems integration resources are moving to IBM ... At the same time that we are increasing our subscription revenue and reaching more consumers through our clients, we will also have a cost base that is more scaleable,” co-Chief Executive Elizabeth Buse told Reuters. Monitise said it expanded its partnership with International Business Machines Corp into a multi-year global alliance to deliver cloud-based mobile money solutions. “We expect these actions to drive a rebound in operating metrics and financial performance, but not until H2 FY15.” Canaccord Genuity analysts said in a note to clients. The company also said it signed a strategic partnership with Santander to develop and deploy a series of mobile banking solutions. Monitise’s registered customers in the year were 30 million, compared with 23 million a year earlier. Live transactions rose 67 percent to 4 billion. Founded in 2003, Monitise processes payments to the value of $88 billion annually. Its customers include Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Visa Inc. Monitise, which also operates in Turkey, India, Hong Kong and Indonesia, said revenue from Britain rose 54 percent to 57.7 million pounds, while the Americas saw a 9.3 percent fall. Shares in the AIM-listed company were down 4.2 percent at 44.5275 pence at 0850 GMT.

640,IBM,IBM launches Watson tool for business clients,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp is rolling out a cognitive tool powered by its Watson supercomputer that uses companies’ internal data to answer questions about performance and efficiency, and predict outcomes. IBM said the tool - the latest in a series of Watson products unveiled by IBM - will make more widely available data analytics capabilities long reserved for research scientists. The move is part of IBM’s effort to shift resources away from a slumping hardware sector into more profitable fields like cloud computing and analytics.  In August, IBM launched Watson Discovery advisor, a tool scientists can use to identify patterns in data. In July, engine maker Pratt and Whitney said it would use IBM’s data analytics to predict aircraft engine trouble.  Watson Analytics clients can upload their business’ data  and ask the tool personalized questions like, “Who are my most profitable customers?”  Watson, which uses artificial intelligence to quickly analyze huge amounts of data and can understand human language, may ask several follow up questions to give clients the most accurate results possible. The cloud-based tool will then analyze various data sets and provide answers and visualizations that predict future outcomes. Watson can also create graphics and charts that allow clients to share the outcomes of their inquiries and better implement solutions to their problems.  “When people have individual problems, they can get answers without having to call a data scientist or call IT, without having to become a data scientist themselves,” said Alistair Rennie, general manager of business analytics for IBM. IBM will equip Watson with geographic, industry and economic data that customers can use in conjunction with their own data.  The interactive tool also automatically prepares, refines and houses data.  The offering  will be launched in beta testing mode within the next month and will be available for all IBM business clients in November. The basic service is available on a “freemium basis” where basic features are free and customers can pay for a premium service, which allows them to work with larger, more complex data sets from a wider array of sources.  “Essentially, we think freemium is important because this is the type of tool that hasn’t been accessible to a wide audience. We’re convinced once professionals get a taste for the base features, they’re going to love it and want to use more of the premium features,” said Rennie.

Goldman suggested buying October $192.50 straddles. Over the past eight quarters, IBM moved an average of 4.6 percent in the week following its report, according to Thomson Reuters data. Currently, Goldman wrote, the options market is pricing in a move of 2.2 percent, “the lowest level since 2006.” The broker added that sentiment on the chipmaker was bearish, which “could indicate investors are more negatively biased ahead of earnings.” The Dow component reports results on Oct. 16. In a straddle strategy, an investor will buy both a bullish call option and a bearish put option at the same strike price, betting that a stock will move by a certain amount, rather than in a specific direction. IBM shares are up about 2 percent in 2014, underperforming the S&P; 500’s 7.8 percent advance. The stock dipped 0.2 percent to $191.31 on Wednesday.

643,IBM,Lenovo says $2.1 billion IBM x86 server deal to close on Wednesday,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Lenovo Group Ltd (0992.HK) will close its acquisition of International Business Machines Corp’s (IBM) (IBM.N) x86 server division on Oct 1 for $2.1 billion, giving the Chinese tech firm the firepower to win business clients from U.S. rivals. The closing purchase price is lower than the $2.3 billion announced in January because of a change in the valuation of inventory and deferred revenue liability, Lenovo said. Roughly $1.8 billion will be paid in cash and the remainder in stock. The purchase is Lenovo’s latest since overtaking Hewlett-Packard Co (HP) (HPQ.N) as the world’s top personal computer (PC) maker last year, in its quest to diversify away from a steadily shrinking PC market. Earlier this year, Lenovo also said it would pay $2.9 billion for Google Inc’s (GOOG.O) Motorola smartphone unit. In an interview, Lenovo Chief Executive Yang Yuanqing said the IBM deal opened a new “growth engine” for his company. He said he expected the x86 unit to bring in $5 billion in its first year and deliver margins higher than the 4 percent of Lenovo’s PC business. “In the large and medium enterprise space we can now fully leverage IBM technology to compete with brands like HP and Dell,” Yang said by telephone. “We can combine this good technology with Lenovo’s efficient operations.” IBM’s x86 server business has trailed those of HP and Dell Inc [DI.UL] in market share. But Yang said Lenovo has expertise competing in markets with razor-thin margins, gained during its journey to becoming the world’s largest PC maker. Lenovo currently sells a line of low-end servers under the ThinkServer brand, but the company pursued IBM’s x86 portfolio because its higher-end machines can perform more complex analytics and database-related functions. The x86 server team will continue to be led by former IBM executive Adalio Sanchez, who will report to Gerry Smith, president of Lenovo’s enterprise business group, Lenovo said in a statement announcing the deal’s impending closure. Some observers expected the deal would take longer to close because of uncertainty about how U.S. regulators might respond to a Chinese company buying a server business during a time of cyber-security tensions between the United States and China.  Lenovo previously bought its consumer PC laptop business from IBM in 2005. In recent years, IBM has been undergoing a strategic shift away from hardware, focusing instead on higher-margin cloud and big data products.

The purchase is Lenovo’s latest since overtaking Hewlett-Packard Co (HP) as the world’s top personal computer (PC) maker last year, in its quest to diversify away from a steadily shrinking PC market. Earlier this year, Lenovo also said it would pay $2.9 billion for Google Inc’s  Motorola smartphone unit. In an interview, Lenovo Chief Executive Yang Yuanqing said the IBM deal opened a new “growth engine” for his company. He said he expected the x86 unit to bring in $5 billion in its first year and deliver margins higher than the 4 percent of Lenovo’s PC business. “In the large and medium enterprise space we can now fully leverage IBM technology to compete with brands like HP and Dell,” Yang said by telephone. “We can combine this good technology with Lenovo’s efficient operations.” IBM’s x86 server business has trailed those of HP and Dell Inc in market share. But Yang said Lenovo has expertise competing in markets with razor-thin margins, gained during its journey to becoming the world’s largest PC maker. Lenovo currently sells a line of low-end servers under the ThinkServer brand, but the company pursued IBM’s x86 portfolio because its higher-end machines can perform more complex analytics and database-related functions. The x86 server team will continue to be led by former IBM executive Adalio Sanchez, who will report to Gerry Smith, president of Lenovo’s enterprise business group, Lenovo said in a statement announcing the deal’s impending closure. Some observers expected the deal would take longer to close because of uncertainty about how U.S. regulators might respond to a Chinese company buying a server business during a time of cyber-security tensions between the United States and China. Lenovo previously bought its consumer PC laptop business from IBM in 2005. In recent years, IBM has been undergoing a strategic shift away from hardware, focusing instead on higher-margin cloud and big data products.

647,IBM,IBM struggles to reinvent itself in an age of cloud,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When IBM Corp CEO Ginni Rometty was asked recently for her tips on how to transform companies, she spoke of “relentless reinvention” and not protecting the past. Applying those precepts to IBM is proving particularly tricky as many of the company’s old-line businesses have already been shut down or sold, while the units that are supposed to push future growth, such as cloud and security, face stiff competition.  Earlier on Monday, IBM reported a marked slowdown in business in September and abandoned its 2015 operating earnings target.  The company also announced it will hive off its loss-making semiconductor unit to contract chipmaker Globalfoundries Inc. Analysts and investors agree that relentless reinvention is something to strive for at Big Blue, but some of the moves tried by other old line technology companies - such as a split or a spinoff of weaker businesses - might not be tenable for IBM, which successfully reinvented itself into a services provider in the early 2000s. “I don’t expect to see anything of that magnitude coming from IBM in part because they have systematically divested some of the businesses that were a drag on earnings in the last decade,” said Charles King, principal analyst at research firm Pund-It in California. Rometty, who took over as CEO nearly three years ago, has accelerated divestitures with the sale of IBM’s low-end server business to Lenovo Group Inc and its chip-making business to Globalfoundries Inc. Those moves eliminated two areas that were a drag on profits, but other problems remain.  Its storage and server hardware and enterprise software sectors are slumping and the company faces growing competition in cloud computing from companies such as Amazon.com Inc.  “They’re on the wrong side of the IT spending food chain. All the growth is in the cloud,” said Dan Ives, analyst at FBR, adding that mature companies have struggled the most with the shift to cloud.  International Business Machines Corp’s faster-growing cloud computing, mobile, business analytics, social and security services contribute 25 percent of its revenue “It is not that they are making a lot of bad choices,” said Scott Kessler at S&P; Capital IQ. “It is just that they are so big and so far along one path, that even if they make some good decisions in terms of investments and acquisitions, it seems like it is too little too late in many contexts.”  Future spin-offs will likely be centered on its storage unit, analysts said. The company is also facing criticism that it pursued buybacks at the expense of investment in new technology. IBM spent $13.5 billion to repurchase stock in the first nine months of the year, more than double its net income.  “The company has been using its cash to repurchase stocks and support its earnings per share, but that has severely weakened its balance sheet, which used to be one of the true strengths of the company,” said Kessler.  The disappointing third-quarter results also raise questions about investors’ patience with Rometty. The CEO, who joined IBM in 1981, recently dispensed advice such as “never define yourself as a product” and “never protect the past” in a Fortune Magazine video interview. Making such ideals into reality is proving tricky at IBM.     “When you miss expectations and come in with results the market is unhappy with, then that puts much more pressure on her, but she bought herself more time by selling off the micro-electronics business,” said Rob Enderle, chief analyst at Enderle Group in California.  “The market today is different than the market that existed a decade ago. She is struggling to readjust to an ever more mobile and cloud business, which caught most of the industry by surprise,” he said.

648,IBM,"IBM ditches 2015 operating EPS target, shares slump 7 percent","(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) reported a marked slowdown in business in September and abandoned its 2015 operating earnings target on Monday, as weak client spending and a slumping software sector weighed down quarterly revenue. IBM shares fell nearly 7 percent to a three-year low, a blow for legendary investor Warren Buffett whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) is its top shareholder. The decline shaved more than $13 billion off of IBM’s market cap, which stood at $182 billion at the stock market close on Friday.  “We are disappointed in our performance,” said Ginni Rometty, IBM chairman, president and chief executive officer. “We saw a marked slowdown in September in client buying behavior, and our results also point to the unprecedented pace of change in our industry.” IBM, the world’s largest technology services company, is struggling to keep up with shifts in the industry as hardware becomes increasingly commoditized. The company, once best known for mainframe computers, has been pivoting to higher-margin businesses such as security software and cloud services, but growth in those areas has failed to offset weakness elsewhere.  In a move to rid itself of one underperforming business, IBM also said on Monday it will hive off its loss-making semiconductor unit to contract chipmaker Globalfoundries Inc. In a sign of the unit’s weakness, IBM is paying Globalfoundries $1.5 billion to take the unit over.  “Some of these fundamental shifts in the industry are happening faster than we planned,” Rometty said on a call with analysts. “We are continuing to remix to higher value.”  IBM is hardly the only technology company having a hard time keeping up with the shift to Internet-based software and storage systems. German software maker SAP SA (SAPG.DE) cut its 2014 operating profit forecast on Monday, citing a faster-than-expected move to cloud-based software. Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) has grappled with similar issues.  IBM will divest low-performing businesses that will contribute almost $7 billion in revenue this year, and plans to continue getting out of those sectors, Rometty said.   Revenue from the company’s cloud service unit, which allows businesses to access software and data remotely, grew more than 50 percent in the quarter, while mobile revenue doubled.  Still, they were not enough to offset weakness in servers and other hardware, as well as some software business lines.  An appreciating U.S. currency, which lowers the value of foreign revenue as reported in dollars, also weighed on earnings and will have a significant impact on profits in the fourth quarter and in 2015, Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter said.      The company is also preparing to take a $600 million charge for “workforce restructuring,” but did not specify how many employees would be affected.  IBM, which said it would announce a new operating earning per share target for 2015 in January, reported a 4 percent drop in third-quarter revenues as clients held back on spending in September. “IBM needs to find success and growth in the cloud through organic and acquisitive means in our opinion, otherwise there could be some darker days ahead for the tech giant (and its investors),” FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said. Revenue fell to $22.4 billion in the quarter from $23.34 billion a year earlier. Analysts expected $23.37 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net profit from continuing operations dropped to $3.46 billion, or $3.46 per share, from $4.14 billion, or $3.77 per share in the same quarter last year.  On an adjusted basis, the company earned $3.68 per share, missing the average analyst estimate of $4.31 per share.

On Wall Street, IBM shares closed down 7.1 percent at $169.10. While IBM’s miss limited the Dow’s gains, the index turned modestly higher before the end of the U.S. session, while the S&P; 500 and Nasdaq advanced. “The fact that the Dow has been able to get positive with IBM’s 13-point decline is pretty significant. It shows the overall strength in the market,” said Philip Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York. “We’re continuing to rebound off of oversold levels,” he said. U.S. corporate earnings season will ramp up this week, with nearly 130 S&P; 500 companies scheduled to report. Apple Inc  posted a better-than-expected 12 percent jump in revenue after Monday’s close . Shares in Apple were roughly flat at about $100 in after-hours trade. European stocks closed lower, meanwhile, after a profit warning from German business software maker SAP hit technology shares. “It’s all about growth at the moment. Cyclicals have been underperforming in recent months ... (and) with respect to SAP, it’s a result of the business investment climate,” said Mike Ingram, market strategist at BGC Partners. Japan’s Nikkei average surged 4 percent, underpinned by news that Japan’s $1.2 trillion public pension would likely more than double its allocation to domestic stocks to about 25 percent.

MSCI’s all-country world index, which tracks shares in 45 nations, was last up 0.74 percent to 399.94, while the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares closed down 0.58 percent at 1,272.72.

But neither company has said much about their progress since the July announcement. “The level of interest from the corporate world has been incredible,” Maestri said after Apple released its September quarter results. The company posted better-than-expected revenue after its best new iPhone launch on record, pushing sales of the smartphone to 39.27 million in the September quarter.

656,IBM,"US STOCKS-S&P;, Nasdaq climb but IBM results weigh on Dow","* IBM slumps after quarterly results * Apple gains, earnings due after the close * Dow down 0.04 pct, S&P; up 0.64 pct, Nasdaq up 0.98 pct   (Updates prices) By Yasmeen Abutaleb NEW YORK, Oct 20 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were mixed on Monday as the S&P; 500 and Nasdaq advanced, but disappointing results from IBM kept the Dow close to the unchanged mark. IBM shares slumped 7.2 percent to $168.92 as the biggest drag on both the Dow and S&P; 500 after third-quarter earnings fell well short of Wall Street expectations. IBM abandoned its 2015 operating earnings target and said it would pay Globalfoundries $1.5 billion over three years to take its loss-making semiconductor unit. “IBM is in a transition and will need to continue to be in transition to catch up. They are nonexistent in mobile and weak in the cloud and just paid somebody to take their semiconductor business,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. “We can look at earnings misses as they should be viewed, which is company-specific.” At 2:05 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average fell 6.12 points, or 0.04 percent, to 16,374.29, the S&P; 500  gained 12.04 points, or 0.64 percent, to 1,898.8 and the Nasdaq Composite added 41.75 points, or 0.98 percent, to 4,300.19. Earnings season will ramp up significantly this week, with nearly 130 S&P; 500 companies scheduled to report, including Apple Inc after the close Monday. According to Thomson Reuters data through Monday morning, of 87 companies in the S&P; 500 that have reported quarterly earnings, 63.2 percent beat analyst expectations, roughly even with the 63 percent average since 1994 but below the 67 percent rate for the past four quarters. Third-quarter earnings are expected to grow 6.7 percent from a year ago, on revenue growth of 3.6 percent. The largest percentage gainer on the S&P; 500 was Tesoro Corp , which rose 6.2 percent, while the largest percentage decliner was IBM. The largest gainer on the Nasdaq 100 was Celgene, which rose 4.6 percent, while the largest decliner was Regeneron Pharma, down 1.8 percent. Among the most active NYSE stocks were Bank of America , up 0.25 percent to $16.25; Petrobras, down 3.75 percent to $14.37; and Oi S.A., down 7.41 percent to $0.47. On the Nasdaq, Apple, up 1.7 percent to $99.34 and Facebook, up 1.0 percent to $76.73, were among the most actively traded. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 2,072 to 962, for a 2.15-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,645 issues rose and 988 fell for a 1.66-to-1 ratio favoring advancers. The benchmark S&P; 500 index was posting 2 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 15 new highs and 32 new lows.

657,IBM,IBM and the financial engineering economy: James Saft,"(Reuters) - IBM’s woes are interesting not simply because they tell us about the economy, but because they reveal broader truths about how, and for whom, companies are run. IBM kicked its 2015 operating earnings goal off the back of the truck on Monday, blaming an outright fall in third-quarter revenues on a sudden downturn in client spending. “We saw a marked slowdown in September in client buying behavior, and our results also point to the unprecedented pace of change in our industry, “ said Ginni Rometty, IBM chairman, president and chief executive officer. IBM shares fell more than 7 percent in reaction, giving up more than three years of gains. In all likelihood, IBM isn’t just a company which ran into an inflection point in the broader economy, nor is it simply an unlucky victim of the step change in the pace of technological innovation. It is a company which did this after five to 10 years of following one of the most popular corporate strategies out there: prioritizing financial engineering over investment, and giving primacy to living quarter by quarter rather than for the longer term. The result, and IBM is far from being alone here, is a company left with a hollowed-out core franchise which has been deprived of investment, combined with higher debt loads. From 2000 to 2013, IBM pursued an epic campaign of buying back shares, flattering earnings but perhaps at the expense of investment in the future, something which, as a technology company, is promised to no one. During that period IBM spent more than $108 billion on share buybacks and an additional $30 billion on dividends. That compares to just $59 billion on capital expenditure. That produced a doubling of pre-tax margin during the period, but arguably at a cost to the value of the core franchise, which looks less and less defensible. Indeed, in the last six years, the company’s debt load has about tripled but sales are essentially flat. In July, hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller drew a line between that strategy and Federal Reserve policy, which he said encourages companies to stint on productivity improvement and investment in the real economy and instead use cheap money to borrow and buy back shares. Buying back shares improves profitability per share, a strategy which tends to work so long as investors believe it is not done at the expense of the company’s ability to remain competitive. IBM may simply be the unlucky victim of market forces as technology evolves, but it is hard to look around the U.S. economy, which has had a combination of very high profit margins and very low capital investment, and wonder if many publicly traded companies are in similarly vulnerable positions. “In our view, IBM is not different from companies like Cisco, Microsoft, Oracle and Intel,” Geneva-based Lombard Odier fund manager Eurof Uppington said via email. “They all face the same sort of pressures from new trends like cloud, mobility and superscale Internet and are all reacting in the same way using financial engineering. IBM is probably just early.” Lombard Odier has been critical of what it calls the GOSOBB strategy, as in Giving Out Stock Options and Buying them Back. While, under accounting rules, this flatters operating earnings, it masks how much money is actually going home in employees’ pockets as compared to if share options were cash payments. Had IBM wanted to offset the dilution caused by employee share options in the five years to mid-year, it would have needed almost $18 billion in share buybacks, or about a third of all buybacks made during the period. IBM are far from unique, much less unusual, in the scope of those figures. The broader unanswered question here is how best to manage a technology company, or indeed an economy, during a period of very rapid technological change. The market tends to assume that company revenues are far stickier, far more permanent than they actually are. That assumption grew out of 100 or more years of analyzing and investing in industrial companies which, while buffeted by war, globalization and technological change, had the luxury of operating in a more slowly changing world. That assumption, that tendency of financial markets to focus on the per-share earnings figure without giving due care to all of the many forces which make those revenues possible, may leave investors today very vulnerable. A decade of share buybacks and underinvestment is starting to look like it may have been a mistake.

661,IBM,Lufthansa close to deal with IBM for IT infrastructure unit,"BERLIN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German airline Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) is close to a deal to sell its IT infrastructure unit to IBM (IBM.N), including an outsourcing agreement for the services, as part of a shake-up of its technology activities, it said on Wednesday. Europe’s largest airline by revenue is undergoing restructuring and cost-cutting efforts to better position itself to compete with low-cost carriers and Gulf rivals. It earlier this year said it was seeking a buyer for the unit, which provides data centers, networks and telephony, because it requires a high level of investment and economies of scale, which the airline could not provide.     Under the planned deal, Lufthansa will outsource all of its IT infrastructure services to IBM under a seven-year deal and the U.S. firm will take over the airline’s IT infrastructure division, currently part of Lufthansa Systems.  The partnership announcement comes two days after IBM, a company undergoing a stark transition of its own, shocked the markets with lower quarterly results and by suspending its full-year forecasts.  IBM, now largely a computer services supplier, said it suffered a marked slowdown in September as many customers stopped buying new services due in part to macroeconomic concerns but also the rapid pace of changing client demand for the latest technologies delivered as Internet-based services. Lufthansa shares rose 2.6 percent in early trading, the top gainer among German blue-chips .GDAXI, as analysts welcomed the progress in the restructuring of the division,  The deal will result in a one-off pre-tax charge of 240 million euros for Lufthansa, which will not impact its operating result for 2014. It will allow Lufthansa to reduce its annual IT costs by around 70 million euros a year. A final price for the sale is still being negotiated, a spokeswoman told Reuters.  The sale is part of plans to reorganize the Lufthansa Systems business into three parts - Infrastructure, Airline Solutions and Industry Solutions, with the latter two to be kept within the Lufthansa group as independent companies.  The infrastructure business, which employs 1,400 people, accounted for 40 percent of Systems’ total turnover of 640 million euros ($883.45 million) in 2013 but it made up only 25 percent of the unit’s profit. The Lufthansa Systems restructuring is expected to be complete in the first quarter of 2015, with the deal to sell the IT infrastructure unit due to complete by March 31, 2015. Other parties reportedly interested in the unit were Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N) and France’s Atos (ATOS.PA).

662,IBM,Big Tech winning battle with 'patent trolls',"(Reuters) - For two decades, companies that buy software patents to sue technology giants have been the scourge of Silicon Valley. Reviled as patent trolls, they have attacked everything from Google’s online ads to Apple’s iPhone features, sometimes winning hundreds of millions of dollars.  But now the trolls are in retreat from the tech titans, interviews and data reviewed by Reuters show.  In the wake of several changes in U.S. law, which make it easier to challenge software patents, patent prices are plummeting, the number of court fights is down, and stock prices of many patent-holding companies have fallen. Some tech firms say they are punching up research budgets as legal costs shrink, while support for major patent reform is under fire as trolls get trounced. “Their entire business model relies on intimidation, and that has lost its edge,” said Efrat Kasznik, president of intellectual property consulting firm Foresight Valuation Group. “If the patents are not enforceable in court anymore... the troll has no legs to stand on.” Brokers who work with the patent acquisition companies acknowledge the new climate. “In some cases, there are just no current buyers for these patents at all,” said Robert Aronoff, founder of the patent brokerage Pluritas, citing new legal standards for the change.  NetApp, a Silicon Valley maker of sophisticated data storage devices, last month used a new legal precedent to force a patent holder to pay its legal fees. The judge called the case “reckless and wasteful.” The new playing field allows NetApp to spend more on developing its own patents, as opposed to litigation defense. “It is freeing up dollars,” said Douglas Luftman, NetApp’s chief intellectual property counsel. To be sure, not all litigious patent owning companies are losing ground. Some with court-tested patents are doing well. And not all big tech companies are convinced of the change. Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) has been at the forefront of the fight against infringement lawsuits and has not seen a drop in new suits in recent months, said General Counsel Mark Chandler. Cisco will continue to push for laws to stop warrantless lawsuits, Chandler said. Others see the need diminishing. Big tech companies distinguish between their own intellectual property, which they fiercely protect, and those of their adversaries, which they often dismiss as broadly worded and vague, allowing holders to sue all manner of defendants. The big tech companies note that the patent acquisition companies they label as trolls generally make no products but are solely in the business of buying patents and litigating to enforce them. The putative trolls see a different world. They buy patents from inventors and each other, creating a marketplace that checks big tech companies’ sway, and rely ultimately on a fair arbiter: courts. This can provide vital protection for investors’ ideas, said Matt Vella, CEO of Acacia Research Corp, which contracts with owners to license their patents to other companies. “I see it as a Robin Hood function,” he said. If the so-called trolls had a birth date, it would be the summer of 1994, when a federal appeals court explicitly allowed computer program patents for the first time.  In the ensuing years, software patents exploded, covering topics from Wi-Fi to one-click shopping. So did patent lawsuits. Last year, more than 6,000 patent suits were filed, according to intellectual property analytics firm Lex Machina. A 2013 White House report said “trolls” were responsible for 60 percent of suits, up from 29 percent in 2010. Congress struck the first blow against these high-volume plaintiffs in an overhaul of the patent system. Starting in 2012, companies accused of infringement could ask the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to invalidate patents used in litigation. The reviews are much cheaper and faster than court. The reviews proved popular — and devastating for many patent owners. As of June, the patent office was invalidating some or all of challenged patents’ claims at a rate of 80 to 90 percent, depending on the type of review.  Then, in June of this year, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that a basic idea — not normally eligible for a patent — does not become patent-worthy if run on a computer. That case, Alice vs. CLS Bank, has made it easier still to quash software patents, and at least 13 lower court rulings since then have done just that. New federal patent lawsuits last month were down 40 percent from the previous year, to 329 cases, data from Lex Machina show.  Defendants are also fighting longer, driving up costs for the acquisition companies. In 2004, the median time it took for a case that didn’t settle was 467 days. By 2013, that had reached 673 days, according to Lex Machina. Intellectual Ventures, one of the largest private patent buyers, laid off over 20 percent of its workforce this year. The company began with backing from big tech companies who saw it as an ally, but some longtime investors including Apple and Intel declined to participate in its latest funding round. Intellectual Ventures declined to comment. A survey of private patent deals compiled by brokerage IPOfferings, found the average price of a patent was $165,000 in the second quarter of 2014, down from $375,000 in 2012. Some patents have withstood challenges under the new legal rules, however. Marathon Patent Group(MARA.O) announced last month that the U.S. government rejected a request by ARM Holdings to invalidate a Marathon patent. Marathon is trading up 28 percent since mid-June. Michael Friedman, managing director at IP strategy firm Ocean Tomo, said patents on widely used technology owned by companies like IBM, Microsoft and Qualcomm, are still in a strong position to seek licenses.  But some companies whose business model depends on successful litigation have seen their stock slide since Alice, the 2014 Supreme Court case. InterDigital (IDCC.O) has fallen over 5 percent and Acacia Research Corp (ACTG.O) is down over 9 percent. (See graphic: link.reuters.com/rej23w)  Just three weeks after Alice was decided, an Acacia Research subsidiary felt its reach when a federal appeals court backed the revocation of a patent on digital image processing, used to sue over 30 tech firms.  Acacia is appealing and said that in general, its other patents will not be impacted by Alice in the same way, since few deal with the kinds of software methods Alice puts at risk.  Still, Vella, Acacia’s CEO, said, said his company sensed the changing legal landscape and is shifting its strategy, away from one-patent cases to challenges based on several patents.

This can provide vital protection for investors’ ideas, said Matt Vella, CEO of Acacia Research Corp, which contracts with owners to license their patents to other companies. “I see it as a Robin Hood function,” he said. If the so-called trolls had a birth date, it would be the summer of 1994, when a federal appeals court explicitly allowed computer program patents for the first time. In the ensuing years, software patents exploded, covering topics from Wi-Fi to one-click shopping. So did patent lawsuits. Last year, more than 6,000 patent suits were filed, according to intellectual property analytics firm Lex Machina. A 2013 White House report said “trolls” were responsible for 60 percent of suits, up from 29 percent in 2010. Congress struck the first blow against these high-volume plaintiffs in an overhaul of the patent system. Starting in 2012, companies accused of infringement could ask the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to invalidate patents used in litigation. The reviews are much cheaper and faster than court. The reviews proved popular — and devastating for many patent owners. As of June, the patent office was invalidating some or all of challenged patents’ claims at a rate of 80 to 90 percent, depending on the type of review. Then, in June of this year, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that a basic idea — not normally eligible for a patent — does not become patent-worthy if run on a computer. That case, Alice vs. CLS Bank, has made it easier still to quash software patents, and at least 13 lower court rulings since then have done just that. New federal patent lawsuits last month were down 40 percent from the previous year, to 329 cases, data from Lex Machina show. Defendants are also fighting longer, driving up costs for the acquisition companies. In 2004, the median time it took for a case that didn’t settle was 467 days. By 2013, that had reached 673 days, according to Lex Machina. Intellectual Ventures, one of the largest private patent buyers, laid off over 20 percent of its workforce this year. The company began with backing from big tech companies who saw it as an ally, but some longtime investors including Apple and Intel declined to participate in its latest funding round. Intellectual Ventures declined to comment. A survey of private patent deals compiled by brokerage IPOfferings, found the average price of a patent was $165,000 in the second quarter of 2014, down from $375,000 in 2012. Some patents have withstood challenges under the new legal rules, however. Marathon Patent Group announced last month that the U.S. government rejected a request by ARM Holdings to invalidate a Marathon patent. Marathon is trading up 28 percent since mid-June. Michael Friedman, managing director at IP strategy firm Ocean Tomo, said patents on widely used technology owned by companies like IBM, Microsoft and Qualcomm, are still in a strong position to seek licenses. But some companies whose business model depends on successful litigation have seen their stock slide since Alice, the 2014 Supreme Court case. InterDigital has fallen over 5 percent and Acacia Research Corp is down over 9 percent. (See graphic: link.reuters.com/rej23w) Just three weeks after Alice was decided, an Acacia Research subsidiary felt its reach when a federal appeals court backed the revocation of a patent on digital image processing, used to sue over 30 tech firms. Acacia is appealing and said that in general, its other patents will not be impacted by Alice in the same way, since few deal with the kinds of software methods Alice puts at risk. Still, Vella, Acacia’s CEO, said, said his company sensed the changing legal landscape and is shifting its strategy, away from one-patent cases to challenges based on several patents.

664,IBM,UPDATE 1-Lufthansa close to deal with IBM for IT infrastructure unit,"* Plans to outsource IT Infrastructure services * IBM to take over Lufthansa’s IT infrastructure unit * Part of reorganisation of Lufthansa’s IT unit * Lufthansa shares rise 2.6 percent   (Adds background on restructuring, shares, comment from Lufthansa Systems) BERLIN/FRANKFURT, Oct 22 (Reuters) - German airline Lufthansa is close to a deal to sell its IT infrastructure unit to IBM, including an outsourcing agreement for the services, as part of a shake-up of its technology activities, it said on Wednesday. Europe’s largest airline by revenue is undergoing restructuring and cost-cutting efforts to better position itself to compete with low-cost carriers and Gulf rivals. It earlier this year said it was seeking a buyer for the unit, which provides data centres, networks and telephony, because it requires a high level of investment and economies of scale, which the airline could not provide. Under the planned deal, Lufthansa will outsource all of its IT infrastructure services to IBM under a seven-year deal and the U.S. firm will take over the airline’s IT infrastructure division, currently part of Lufthansa Systems. The partnership announcement comes two days after IBM, a company undergoing a stark transition of its own, shocked the markets with lower quarterly results and by suspending its full-year forecasts. IBM, now largely a computer services supplier, said it suffered a marked slowdown in September as many customers stopped buying new services due in part to macroeconomic concerns but also the rapid pace of changing client demand for the latest technologies delivered as Internet-based services. Lufthansa shares rose 2.6 percent in early trading, the top gainer among German blue-chips, as analysts welcomed the progress in the restructuring of the division, The deal will result in a one-off pre-tax charge of 240 million euros for Lufthansa, which will not impact its operating result for 2014. It will allow Lufthansa to reduce its annual IT costs by around 70 million euros a year. A final price for the sale is still being negotiated, a spokeswoman told Reuters. The sale is part of plans to reorganise the Lufthansa Systems business into three parts - Infrastructure, Airline Solutions and Industry Solutions, with the latter two to be kept within the Lufthansa group as independent companies. The infrastructure business, which employs 1,400 people, accounted for 40 percent of Systems’ total turnover of 640 million euros ($883.45 million) in 2013 but it made up only 25 percent of the unit’s profit. The Lufthansa Systems restructuring is expected to be complete in the first quarter of 2015, with the deal to sell the IT infrastructure unit due to complete by March 31, 2015. Other parties reportedly interested in the unit were Hewlett-Packard and France’s Atos.

671,IBM,Fitch Solutions: IBM's CDS Reach Widest Level in 3 Years,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 29 (Fitch) Pervasively negative market sentiment over  International Business Machines (IBM) is sending its credit default swap (CDS)  spreads to levels not seen since 2011, according to Fitch Solutions in its  latest CDS Case Study snapshot. Five-year CDS on IBM have widened 22% over the past month. Long at ‘AA-‘ levels,  credit protection on IBM’s debt is now pricing three notches lower in ‘A-‘  territory. ‘IBM’s disappointing earnings are intensifying market scrutiny, as is  uncertainty over its ability to accelerate focus revenue growth within the  context of rapidly changing industry dynamics,’ said Director Diana  Allmendinger. Recent divestitures will drive profit margin expansion, while a slower pace of  share repurchases supports expectations for reduced leverage in the  intermediate-term. Fitch Solutions case studies build on data from its CDS Pricing Service and  proprietary quantitative models, including CDS Implied Ratings. These credit  risk indicators are designed to provide real-time, market-based views of  creditworthiness. As such, they can and often do reflect more short term market  views on factors such as currencies, seasonal market effects and short-term  technical influences. This is in contrast to Fitch Ratings’ Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs), which are based on forward-looking fundamental credit analysis  over an extended period of time.

676,IBM,UPDATE 1-Big companies disclose too little on operations abroad -watchdog,"* Many Chinese firms fare badly: Transparency International * Watchdog also points a finger at some U.S. tech giants * Lack of disclosure can harm brands, report says   (Adds IBM statement) By Michael Nienaber BERLIN, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The world’s biggest companies disclose little or no financial details about their operations abroad, according to a report by Transparency International, which singled out Chinese companies but pointed to U.S. tech giants like Amazon and Google as well. The Berlin-based anti-corruption watchdog named Bank of China, Honda Motor, Bank of Communications , Agricultural Bank of China and Russia’s Sberbank as the five least transparent companies. Bank of China could not be reached for comment on the report. The other four companies declined to comment. “We need more transparency from multinational companies, whose power in the world economy closely rivals the biggest countries,” said Transparency International chairman Jose Ugaz. “By not responding to people’s demands for greater transparency and accountability, companies risk harming their brand and losing customers,” he warned. Around three quarters of the 124 companies assessed do not disclose the taxes they pay in foreign countries and nearly half publish no information on revenues abroad, the report said. The companies were ranked based on their reporting of their measures to prevent corruption, information about subsidiaries and holdings and information about financial operations abroad. By those criteria, European companies performed best. Italy’s Eni, Britain’s Vodafone and Norway’s Statoil were the leaders. “We are committed to providing as much information and insight as possible to support informed public debate on issues such as corporate governance, anti-corruption programmes and corporate taxation,” said a spokesman for Vodafone. While there were six Chinese companies among the 10 worst performers, U.S. corporations also figured. Warren Buffet’s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway was ranked the sixth least transparent multinational, and the report said major tech companies also performed relatively poorly. “Surprisingly, the sector that makes greater transparency possible is one of the least transparent,” said Transparency. AAmazon, Apple, Google and IBM all scored less than three out of 10, the organization said. A spokesman from IBM said the company was publishing a full list of every subsidiary and country in which it does business every year. That list was part of IBM’s annual report. The other U.S. companies cited declined to comment or were unavailable when asked for a reaction by Reuters. Some did not want to respond until they had seen the complete report. A spokesperson for Japan’s Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp, which was also among the bottom 10, said: “We want to continue to work towards appropriate disclosures.” Transparency said the world’s biggest oil, gas and mining companies were not yet ready for transparency rules that would enter into force across the European Union from July 2015. Those regulations require extractive companies to report payments such as taxes to governments on a country-by-country and project-by-project basis. In the United States, similar measures are planned, but implementation has been delayed.

677,IBM,U.S. judge declines broker guilty plea in IBM insider trading case,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former stockbroker pleaded guilty on Thursday to his role in an insider trading scheme centered on a technology company acquired by International Business Machines Corp in 2009. Daryl Payton, a former trader at Connecticut-based Euro Pacific Capital Inc, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud in New York federal court, one month before he was scheduled to face trial alongside another former Euro Pacific broker, Benjamin Durant. But in an unusual move, U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter declined to accept his plea, saying he was not convinced Payton had properly articulated how he knew the inside information in question was obtained as a result of a breach of confidentiality. Carter gave U.S. prosecutors and Payton’s attorneys until next week to submit court papers explaining why he should accept the plea as sufficient. Payton and Durant were charged in June for their alleged involvement in an information-sharing conspiracy focused on IBM’s purchase of software maker SPSS Inc in 2009. Three people have already admitted to sharing and trading on secret information about the acquisition that originally came from a corporate lawyer. The lawyer, who has not been charged, has been identified in a related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil lawsuit as Michael Dallas, a former associate at the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore. Authorities said Dallas shared information about the pending deal with a friend, Trent Martin, an analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. Martin then told his roommate, Thomas Conradt, a broker at Euro Pacific, authorities said. Conradt in turn shared the tip with others at his firm, including Payton and Durant, who prosecutors said purchased options and shares in SPSS based on the insider information.

678,IBM,U.S. judge declines broker guilty plea in IBM insider trading case,"NEW YORK, Nov 6 (Reuters) - A former stockbroker pleaded guilty on Thursday to his role in an insider trading scheme centered on a technology company acquired by International Business Machines Corp in 2009. Daryl Payton, a former trader at Connecticut-based Euro Pacific Capital Inc, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud in New York federal court, one month before he was scheduled to face trial alongside another former Euro Pacific broker, Benjamin Durant. But in an unusual move, U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter declined to accept his plea, saying he was not convinced Payton had properly articulated how he knew the inside information in question was obtained as a result of a breach of confidentiality. Carter gave U.S. prosecutors and Payton’s attorneys until next week to submit court papers explaining why he should accept the plea as sufficient. Payton and Durant were charged in June for their alleged involvement in an information-sharing conspiracy focused on IBM’s purchase of software maker SPSS Inc in 2009. Three people have already admitted to sharing and trading on secret information about the acquisition that originally came from a corporate lawyer. The lawyer, who has not been charged, has been identified in a related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil lawsuit as Michael Dallas, a former associate at the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore. Authorities said Dallas shared information about the pending deal with a friend, Trent Martin, an analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. Martin then told his roommate, Thomas Conradt, a broker at Euro Pacific, authorities said. Conradt in turn shared the tip with others at his firm, including Payton and Durant, who prosecutors said purchased options and shares in SPSS based on the insider information.

682,IBM,Iusacell's $2.5 billion suit against IBM on hold due to arbitration,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday put on hold a $2.5 billion lawsuit by Mexican mobile phone operator Iusacell SA de CV accusing IBM Corp of fraudulent misrepresentations, citing a pending arbitration launched by the U.S. technology giant. U.S. District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald in New York granted IBM’s bid to stay the lawsuit as it involved issues central to an arbitration pending before the International Chamber of Commerce. In 2010, Iusacell signed a contract with IBM’s Mexico unit, which under the agreement would improve and operate Iusacell’s IT systems. In a lawsuit filed in April, Iusacell alleged that IBM claimed it would provide “virtually unlimited” resources to the company for the project, even though it only intended to provide limited, inadequate amounts of resources to Iusacell. Iusacell contended that under Mexican law it was entitled to recover both its actual damages and lost profits, including $2.5 billion in lost revenue. Iusacell is co-owned by media and retail mogul Ricardo Salinas’ Grupo Salinas and broadcast giant Grupo Televisa. Earlier this month, AT&T; Inc agreed to acquire Iusacell for $1.7 billion. The deal will occur after Grupo Salinas buys out its partner’s 50 percent stake in Iusacell. IBM moved for a stay of the lawsuit in light of the arbitration, which its Mexican unit commenced in November 2013 seeking payment under the contract. IBM is seeking $300 million in the arbitration, according to the court ruling. A final hearing in the arbitration is scheduled for February 2016, Buchwald said. While Buchwald agreed to stay the lawsuit, she said she would entertain a future motion to vacate it based on “materially changed circumstances.” Representatives for the companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Late on Tuesday, IBM announced the third in a string of billion dollar plus contracts, saying it had won a seven-year, $1.25 billion deal with WPP, the world’s top advertising firm, to run WPP operations in the cloud. On Monday, IBM disclosed a multi-billion dollar deal to provide computer infrastructure services to Dutch bank ABN Amro[ABRGPA.UL]. And last month, Lufthansa agreed a $1.25 billion contract for IBM to take over the German airline’s information technology operations and staff. Bart Van den Daele, IBM’s general manager for strategic outsourcing in Europe, said big contract signings slowed in the depths of the euro crisis but that the region’s customers are ready to play catch-up. “(There’s) a new wave of big deals which is still continuing and we see it going forward,” Van den Daele said in a phone interview. “Now you see the first results with Lufthansa, ABN Amro and WPP and there will be others.” The common theme among European customers is their growing willingness to embrace the global corporate shift to Internet-based computing, or so-called cloud services, but while demanding several local twists, he said. IBM seeks to differentiate its offering by focussing on hybrid clouds, which mix together the private, on-premise computer systems for which it has long been known with newer public-facing Internet, mobile and analytics systems, allowing clients to move existing systems to the cloud at their own pace. This hybrid approach means companies can wait for years before they consider moving their most sensitive core financial systems to the cloud computers. It also gives them the option of never having to move. Secondly, European clients demand that their data remain stored locally in European data centre, a requirement IBM has met by building seven public cloud data centres across Europe in London, Amsterdam, Paris and one in Germany, with another to follow there shortly.  WPP’s deal will allow the London-based company to stitch together the operations of the more than 300 agencies it has acquired through a relentless roll-up of the advertising business over the past decade and more. WPP signed its contract last quarter but it only went live recently, IBM’s Van den Daele said.

10,IBM,REFILE-UPDATE 3-U.S. authorities face new fallout from insider trading ruling,"(Correct spelling of first name in 21st paragraph to Glen from Glenn) By Nate Raymond and Aruna Viswanatha NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors, already smarting from a appeals court ruling that weakens their ability to crack down on future insider trading, on Thursday faced widening fallout from the decision as some existing cases threatened to unravel. Lawyers for some defendants hinted they might seek to withdraw guilty pleas, and a Manhattan federal judge questioned if four such pleas were affected. The moves were the latest repercussions from the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals finding that prosecutors presented insufficient evidence to convict Todd Newman, a former portfolio manager at Diamondback Capital Management, and Anthony Chiasson, co-founder of Level Global Investors. Speaking at a conference, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Jo White said Thursday “there is no question it’s a significant decision,” adding her agency was reviewing the Wednesday ruling, which she called “overly narrow.” Some defendants who cooperated and pleaded guilty in the prosecution of Newman and Chiasson are now considering taking the extraordinary step of withdrawing their pleas, two lawyers said Thursday. The three-judge panel not only found that prosecutors needed to prove a trader knew that the original source of non-public information has received a benefit in exchange for the tip, but also narrowed what actually constituted such a benefit. In several such cases, the defendants were tipped based on information they received third- or fourth-hand, rather than straight from the source, which made it tougher to prove their awareness that source had obtained something tangible in return. The ruling threatens to challenge a broad insider trading crackdown underway since 2009 under Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, whose office during his tenure has secured 82 other convictions. While the pace of prosecutions had looked set to gradually slow from the breakneck pace of recent years, the appeals court’s ruling could slam the brakes on authorities’ efforts to pursue future cases. Many on Wall Street say that despite Bharara’s thrusts against the practice, trading on privileged information remains common amid the current M&A; boom, with Merck & Co’s  acquisition of Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc just the latest deal to have seen unusual options activity before being announced. Among those threatening to withdraw plea deals is Danny Kuo, a former Whittier Trust Co analyst who pleaded guilty in 2012 and turned cooperator. Roland Riopelle, Kuo’s lawyer, said in an interview he had calls into the U.S. Attorney’s Office. While he had not made a definite decision, the issue was “certainly worth studying.” “If there’s no crime there, that’s a good reason to withdraw your plea,” he said. Kuo was nearly sentenced to six months in prison in July by  U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan, whose ruling in the Newman and Chiasson case was subject to the appeal. But Sullivan delayed sentencing, saying if the 2nd Circuit reversed him and required proof a tippee knew an insider received something for non-public information, he was “not sure, frankly, in the guilty plea there’s a sufficient basis to conclude that Mr. Kuo had that knowledge.” The ruling may also benefit Michael Steinberg, a SAC Capital portfolio manager convicted in 2013 and later sentenced to 3-1/2 years in prison as part of the same conspiracy. Steinberg had raised similar arguments on appeal as Newman and Chiasson, and his lawyer, Barry Berke, said Wednesday the ruling meant his conviction would be vacated as well. Separately, U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter in Manhattan scheduled hearings for Dec. 18 to address whether the ruling affects the pleas of the four men, who admitted to engaging in a scheme to buy options and stock in software maker SPSS Inc prior to the announcement that IBM Corp was acquiring it. The defendants include former Euro Pacific Capital Inc traders Daryl Payton, Thomas Conradt and David Weishaus as well as Trent Martin, a former analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. The order came after prosecutors late Wednesday asked Carter to suspend a pretrial schedule for a Jan. 12 trial of the last remaining defendant in the case, saying the appellate ruling raised “potential legal issues” that could affect the trial. Lawyers for the defendants in the IBM case did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Beyond pending cases, the ruling could also affect pending investigations involving similar chains of tippees, said Glen Kopp, a former prosecutor at Bracewell & Giuliani. That would especially be true, he said, if authorities were sitting on cases following oral arguments in the case in April, at which some judges voiced skepticism of the prosecution’s interpretation of the law. “Could it impact more cases? Absolutely,” Kopp said. As hedge fund managers and their lawyers digested Wednesday’s news, many began speculation about how the decision might impact their industry in the weeks and months ahead, with one former prosecutor who didn’t want to be identified saying he thought it could lead to firms seeking tips more aggressively. “I think people will be conservative for a while to start,” he said, adding that after a while, traders would likely start to make on-the-spot decisions that fell into a riskier category. “I think people will feel freer to send their analysts out to get information and they’ll take more risks.”   (Reporting by John McCrank, Nate Raymond, Emily Flitter, Svea Herbst in New York, and Aruna Viswanatha in Washington, writing by Aruna Viswanatha; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Christian Plumb)",12112014,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-insidertrading/refile-update-3-u-s-authorities-face-new-fallout-from-insider-trading-ruling-idUSL1N0TV1JU20141211

12,IBM,IBM says cloud business enjoying 'breakthrough year',"LONDON (Reuters) - IBM aims to expand the number of data centers it offers clients around the world by 25 percent to meet fast-rising demand for internet-based services, after what a company executive said has been a “breakthrough year” in 2014 for its cloud computing business. IBM has quadrupled the number of cloud data facilities it offers around the world to 49 in the past 18 months, responding in part to laws requiring the local retention of data following revelations over U.S. government Web surveillance as well as  increased corporate compliance rules. The company said on Wednesday it has now struck a partnership with data center provider Equinix Inc for nine more cloud centers in Australia, France, Japan, Singapore, The Netherlands and the United States. In addition the company is opening up three new cloud computer facilities of its own in Germany, Mexico and Japan. The information technology giant, which is contending with a change in its classic business mix of software and outsourcing services as corporate clients focus on reaching their customers via the Internet and mobile phones, said its own cloud business is having a banner year. “We have had a really good year. We would call it a breakthrough year in cloud,” Angel Luiz Diaz, vice president in charge of IBM’s cloud computing business, told Reuters. IBM’s cloud revenue amounted to $4.4 billion in 2013 and was up by 50 percent in the first nine months of this year, it reported in October, making it one of IBM’s fastest-growing businesses, although it still accounts for only a fraction of the $94 billion in total revenues which IBM is expected by analysts to generate this year. Diaz declined to comment on the company’s performance during the fourth quarter but IBM has announced multi-year deals in recent weeks worth a total of more than $4 billion that are fuelling the company’s expansion in data centers. The company’s cloud computing services let companies mix classic computing jobs with new ways of working, a twist on the largely consumer-facing cloud services made popular by Amazon’s  Web Services, Google and Microsoft.  IBM, along with rivals Hewlett-Packard and EMC’s vmWare, offer “hybrid cloud” services that let customers run key business data on private, internal networks along with consumer-facing public cloud systems.  Such hybrids provide companies with certain speed, security and regulatory advantages but at similar costs as public clouds,  said industry analyst Charles King of the firm Pund-IT. Mixed systems also let customers move their existing business software to the Internet over several years rather than in one big leap. So far this quarter IBM has set major deals with airline Lufthansa, Dutch bank ABN AMRO, advertising giant WPP, audio electronics maker Woox Innovations in Hong Kong and the Dow Water arm of Dow Chemical. IBM has also put in place a variety of technology partnership deals with SAP, Microsoft, Tencent, AT&T; and Intel to give its customers more flexibility in running other major business systems on IBM cloud networks. IBM also said on Wednesday it had reached a cloud services deal with National Express Group Plc to enable the UK-based bus and trains operator to offer commuters up-to-the-minute train schedules and what it said would be Britain’s first postcode-to-postcode journey planner.

It may extend that by 10 working days to 35 working days, to consider either a company’s proposed remedies or an EU member state’s request to handle the case. Most mergers win approval but occasionally the Commission  opens a detailed second-stage investigation for up to 90  additional working days, which it may extend to 105 working  days. Under the simplified procedure, the Commission announces the clearance of uncontroversial first-stage mergers without giving any reason for its decision. Cases may be reclassified as non-simplified — that is, ordinary first-stage reviews — until they are approved.

15,IBM,EU clears Lufthansa outsourcing deal with IBM,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Wednesday it had approved the sale of Lufthansa’s (LHAG.DE) IT infrastructure unit to IBM (IBM.N). Lufthansa was seeking a buyer for the unit, which provides data centers, networks and telephony, because it requires a high level of investment and economies of scale, which the airline could not provide. “The Commission concluded that the proposed acquisition would not raise competition concerns given the very limited overlaps between the parties’ activities and the presence of several strong alternative players that would remain active after the merger,” the EU executive said in a statement. The deal, which was announced on October, will result in a one-off pre-tax charge of 240 million euros ($299 million) for Lufthansa. It will allow Lufthansa to reduce its annual IT costs by around 70 million euros a year. Under the planned deal, Lufthansa will outsource all its IT infrastructure services to IBM under a seven-year deal and the U.S. firm will take over the airline’s IT infrastructure division, currently part of Lufthansa Systems. The transaction was examined by the European Commission under the normal merger review procedure.

17,IBM,U.S. judge says to likely vacate insider trading guilty pleas over IBM deal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge said Thursday he would likely vacate the guilty pleas of four men accused of engaging in an insider trading scheme ahead of an IBM Corp deal, as fallout continued from an appellate ruling curtailing authorities’ abilities to pursue such cases. U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter in Manhattan questioned whether the pleas had an “insufficient factual basis” in light of the decision from the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a view shared by the defendants’ lawyers. The 2nd Circuit on Dec. 10 held that prosecutors needed to prove a trader knew that the original source of non-public information received a benefit in exchange for the tip. Legal experts have said the decision will make it harder to pursue cases involving so-called remote tipees, in which defendants were tipped based on information they received third-or-fourth hand, instead of directly from the source. Prosecutors from Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara’s office on Thursday urged Carter to hold off on his decision to give them time to submit briefing on why the appellate ruling did not apply. Carter agreed, but said the decision was “pretty clear.” “My inclination is you’re wrong on that,” Carter said at one of a series of hearings to a prosecutor. The proceedings marked the latest reverberations from the 2nd Circuit decision reversing the insider trading convictions of hedge fund managers Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson. Thursday’s hearing centered on guilty pleas entered before the appellate ruling came down by former Euro Pacific Capital Inc traders Daryl Payton, Thomas Conradt and David Weishaus as well as Trent Martin, a former analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. Authorities said in 2009, Martin learned from a friend working at IBM’s law firm that it planned to acquire software maker SPSS Inc in a deal later valued at $1.2 billion. While the friend expected Martin to keep the details secret, the RBS analyst bought SPSS stock and told Condradt, his roommate, prosecutors said. Condradt in turn told his co-workers Weishaus, Payton and Benjamin Durant, who has pleaded not guilty, authorities said. If their pleas are vacated, the men would go to trial with Durant on Feb. 23. He had been scheduled for trial Jan. 12, but Carter on Thursday adjourned it a month in light of the appellate ruling. A spokeswoman for Bharara declined comment. He has said he is considering appealing the 2nd Circuit decision. The case is U.S. v.

20,IBM,IBM says cloud business enjoying 'breakthrough year',"LONDON (Reuters) - IBM aims to expand the number of data centers it offers clients around the world by 25 percent to meet fast-rising demand for internet-based services, after what a company executive said has been a “breakthrough year” in 2014 for its cloud computing business. IBM has quadrupled the number of cloud data facilities it offers around the world to 49 in the past 18 months, responding in part to laws requiring the local retention of data following revelations over U.S. government Web surveillance as well as  increased corporate compliance rules. The company said on Wednesday it has now struck a partnership with data center provider Equinix Inc for nine more cloud centers in Australia, France, Japan, Singapore, The Netherlands and the United States. In addition the company is opening up three new cloud computer facilities of its own in Germany, Mexico and Japan. The information technology giant, which is contending with a change in its classic business mix of software and outsourcing services as corporate clients focus on reaching their customers via the Internet and mobile phones, said its own cloud business is having a banner year. “We have had a really good year. We would call it a breakthrough year in cloud,” Angel Luiz Diaz, vice president in charge of IBM’s cloud computing business, told Reuters. IBM’s cloud revenue amounted to $4.4 billion in 2013 and was up by 50 percent in the first nine months of this year, it reported in October, making it one of IBM’s fastest-growing businesses, although it still accounts for only a fraction of the $94 billion in total revenues which IBM is expected by analysts to generate this year. Diaz declined to comment on the company’s performance during the fourth quarter but IBM has announced multi-year deals in recent weeks worth a total of more than $4 billion that are fuelling the company’s expansion in data centers. The company’s cloud computing services let companies mix classic computing jobs with new ways of working, a twist on the largely consumer-facing cloud services made popular by Amazon’s  Web Services, Google and Microsoft.  IBM, along with rivals Hewlett-Packard and EMC’s VMware, offer “hybrid cloud” services that let customers run key business data on private, internal networks along with consumer-facing public cloud systems.  Such hybrids provide companies with certain speed, security and regulatory advantages but at similar costs as public clouds,  said industry analyst Charles King of the firm Pund-IT. Mixed systems also let customers move their existing business software to the Internet over several years rather than in one big leap. So far this quarter IBM has set major deals with airline Lufthansa, Dutch bank ABN AMRO, advertising giant WPP, audio electronics maker Woox Innovations in Hong Kong and the Dow Water arm of Dow Chemical. IBM has also put in place a variety of technology partnership deals with SAP, Microsoft, Tencent, AT&T; and Intel to give its customers more flexibility in running other major business systems on IBM cloud networks. IBM also said on Wednesday it had reached a cloud services deal with National Express Group Plc to enable the UK-based bus and trains operator to offer commuters up-to-the-minute train schedules and what it said would be Britain’s first postcode-to-postcode journey planner.

Major indexes opened with slight gains but strengthened throughout the session, ending near their highs of the day. Despite that, trading was quiet with many market participants out ahead of the upcoming Christmas holiday. About 6.41 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, compared with the month-to-date average of 7.86 billion.

Some may say oil stocks are bargains now, but it’s too soon to say.” Crude oil sank 3.2 percent after Saudi Arabia’s powerful oil minister said OPEC would not cut production at any price. The S&P; energy index fell 1 percent as one of the day’s weakest sectors; Chesapeake Energy  fell 7.3 percent to $18.42 while Southwestern Energy  was off 5.5 percent at $29.31.

Both the Dow and S&P; ended at closing records, with the benchmark S&P; building on a 3.4 percent rise last week.

Gilead slumped 14 percent to $92.90 as the biggest drag on both the S&P; and Nasdaq 100. Express Scripts , the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit manager, said it would no longer cover Gilead’s treatments after it lined up a cheaper price from AbbVie Inc for its newly approved hepatitis C treatment.

26,IBM,Breakingviews: IBM turnaround requires atypical activist fix,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - IBM requires an atypical activist fix. Big Blue’s strategy of cost cuts and debt-fueled buybacks is no longer working - even though the company keeps trying. A tarnished balance sheet, lean staffing and a history of disposals rule out typical activist wheezes. Encouraging Chair and Chief Executive Ginni Rometty to invest in IBM’s core businesses could pay off. For two decades IBM has run the same playbook. It sells low-margin businesses, slashes expenses, buys some profitable software companies, and returns a lot of cash to investors. Over the past four quarters, the $152 billion company has spent more than $23 billion on dividends and buybacks. The snag is that IBM is investing too little. Big Blue has only spent about $11 billion over the past four quarters in total on R&D;, capital expenditure and acquisitions. That’s a problem in tech, where old products soon become obsolete. While Google spends about 16 percent of its sales on R&D;, IBM spends 6 percent. The effect is becoming clear on the top line. Revenue has shrunk for 10 quarters in a row. Costs have been cut to the bone, sending customers fleeing to better service providers. In a good year for stocks, IBM shares have fallen more than 15 percent. That means IBM has overpaid on its last three years of buybacks. That has spurred talk of activists. But what could rabble-rousing shareholders demand? Unlike Yahoo  there’s no obvious gem to dispose of or cash-laden balance sheet to raid. IBM has been selling off hardware, like last quarter’s disposal of the chip division, lessening the appeal of an HP-style breakup. IBM hasn’t done any big acquisitions recently, so an activist can’t argue it is wasting capital like HP, which wrote off three-quarters of the $12 billion it paid for Autonomy. And year after year of punishing cost cuts leave no obvious fat to cut. A better idea is to invest more in the business. Assume IBM repurchases $10 billion of stock next year. Bought back at current rates, that would result in a 7 percent increase in earnings per share. Meanwhile, IBM’s pre-tax return on its business assets is 22 percent. Diverting that $10 billion into the business could result in more than $2 billion of pre-tax profit. Put this on IBM’s low 20 percent tax rate and the result is more than a 12 percent increase in earnings per share. IBM’s focus on financial, rather than product, engineering has caused low employee morale, falling sales and shareholder dissatisfaction. It’s time to invest. - IBM’s revenue shrank by 4 percent in the third quarter of 2014 compared to the same period a year earlier. That is the 10th consecutive quarter revenue has declined.

27,IBM,"IBM profit forecast, fourth-quarter revenue below estimates","(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp posted a new 2015 profit target and quarterly revenue that both missed analysts’ estimates, as the one-time world technology leader continues to grapple with its journey from low-margin hardware maker to the new world of cloud computing.Shares of IBM, which is still the world’s largest technology services company, but no longer regarded as a leader in innovation, fell 1.6 percent to $154.48 in extended trading. The Armonk, New York-based company has seen shrinking revenue for three years now as it sheds unprofitable businesses such as its low-end server unit and tries to focus on emerging areas such as security software and cloud services. But the new businesses have so far failed to make up for revenue lost to divestitures. The company’s annual revenue fell to $93 billion for 2014, from $107 billion in 2011. The company had no guarantee that it would not fall further. “We’re not interested in revenue for revenue’s sake,” IBM Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter told Reuters in a phone interview. “We’ll continue to divest if something doesn’t fit the model.”   The struggle to make headway in the new Internet-based technology industry is shared by other longstanding giants. SAP, Europe’s largest software group, on Tuesday cut key profit forecasts and abandoned a target for higher margins.  “IBM as well as other tech stalwarts such as Oracle, SAP, HP and Cisco face major headwinds as they adjust to this new cloud paradigm shift, which coupled with a cloudy IT spending environment have negatively impacted results,” said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. IBM last year withdrew its long-term plan to hit $20 per share in operating earnings for 2015, as it recognized that its transition was faltering.

The lower forecasts implied less demand for fuel through 2016, contributing to another fall in crude oil, although some  bullish results from major energy companies kept the sector afloat. The S&P; energy index eked out a gain of 0.09 percent. The IMF cut its forecasts for both years by 0.3 percentage points and advised advanced economies to maintain accommodative monetary policies to avoid increases in real interest rates as cheaper oil increases deflation risk. The European Central Bank is expected to announce a bond buying program on Thursday to boost the region’s flagging economy. “Any sense at all that the ECB disappoints, you will see the markets correct rather harshly,” said Ken Polcari, Director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York. “You can speculate all you want and investors can take the market higher all they want, but until the ECB comes out and says it, you are not really going to know.” The Dow Jones industrial average rose 3.66 points, or 0.02 percent, to 17,515.23, the S&P; 500 gained 3.12 points, or 0.15 percent, to 2,022.54 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 20.46 points, or 0.44 percent, to 4,654.85.

Johnson & Johnson fell 2.6 percent to $101.29 as the biggest drag on both the Dow and S&P; 500 after adjusted earnings beat expectations but revenue missed forecasts.

34,IBM,"GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks, euro gain on European bond-buying hopes","(Adds late prices, Wall Street close, Canada rate cut) * ECB planned bond buys reported at 50 billion euros a month * IBM shares sag after outlook, drag on Wall Street * Oil rises more than 2 percent By Michael Connor NEW YORK, Jan 21 (Reuters) - European and U.S. equities rose on Wednesday, lifted by reports the European Central Bank will announce a 50 billion euros per month bond-buying program to boost the euro zone’s flagging economy. U.S. Treasury prices fell while the euro rose against the dollar. A source told Reuters the ECB’s Executive Board has proposed a program that would enable the bank to buy 50 billion euros ($58 billion) in bonds a month from March. The FTSEurofirst 300 index, which tracks European stock markets, turned positive on the news and closed up for a fifth day with a 0.6 percent rise. London’s FTSE 100  ended 1.6 percent higher. ECB head Mario Draghi will speak to the media at 8:30 a.m. EST (1330 GMT) on Thursday. “The ECB rumor was very important. The market’s perception was that Draghi was going to disappoint tomorrow in the magnitude” of the program, said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York. The euro hit a nearly one-week high against the dollar, at $1.168, and was last at $1.1580, according to Thomson Reuters data. The expectations of ECB action, with the potential stimulus seen at around 600 billion euros ($690 billion), according to a Reuters poll, kept core euro zone bond yields near record lows. U.S. stocks posted smaller gains, capped in part by a 3.1 percent slump in International Business Machines shares after the company issued a disappointing outlook. IBM, down $4.86 at $152.09, was among the biggest decliners on the S&P.; The Dow Jones industrial average rose  39.05 points, or 0.22 percent, to 17,554.28, the S&P; 500 ended  up 9.57 points, or 0.47 percent, to 2,032.12 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 12.58 points, or 0.27 percent, to 4,667.42. The MSCI World Index of equities markets was up 0.5 percent. U.S. Treasury yields ended higher as investors unwound bullish positions on the ECB bond-buying reports and a surprise interest rate cut by the Bank of Canada. After nearing record lows touched last week, yields on U.S. 30-year bonds were 2.4427 percent, reflecting a price drop of 31/32. The Japanese yen rose more 1 percent against the U.S. dollar  after the Bank of Japan left policy unchanged. Though the decision by the BoJ not to expand its stimulus package had been widely expected, some had bet on a surprise move as inflation targets looked elusive. The yen later reclaimed some losses and last stood at 118 yen to the dollar. The Canadian dollar plunged more than 2 percent against the U.S. dollar to its weakest since April 2009, after the Bank of Canada shocked financial markets with its interest-rate cut. Oil prices  rose 2 percent, with Brent crude at $48.94 a barrel, following a recent heavy sell-off that led Total’s chief executive to say the French energy major plans to cut capital spending by 10 percent this year.

Market participants have been looking for more aggressive measures from central banks, specifically the ECB, to combat the risk of deflation and a weakening euro zone economy. A source told Reuters that the ECB’s Executive Board has proposed a program that would enable the bank to buy 50 billion euros ($58 billion) in bonds per month starting in March. ECB President Mario Draghi will speak to the media at 1330 GMT on Thursday. “The ECB rumor was very important. The market’s perception was that Draghi was going to disappoint tomorrow in the magnitude” of the program, said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York. He said, regardless of the size of the expected purchase program, there are many details in terms of the assets available for purchase and how those will affect individual members of the bloc. “The rules of the game may not be as fortuitous as investors and Draghi might like to be able to get the most bang for the buck.” U.S. stocks would benefit from a program in support of a stronger euro zone economy because Europe is one of the United States’ most important trade partners. At 3:03 p.m. EST (2003 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  rose 25.4 points, or 0.15 percent, to 17,540.63, the S&P; 500 gained 8.35 points, or 0.41 percent, to 2,030.9 and the Nasdaq Composite added 12.28 points, or 0.26 percent, to 4,667.12 S&P; 500 energy shares were the day’s best performers, up 1.5 percent alongside a 2.5 percent gain in the price of U.S. crude futures. The S&P; 500 oil and gas exploration and production index rose 2.7 percent. Despite the advance, crude futures remain on track to post their fifteenth negative week in the last 17. IBM shares fell 3.1 percent to $152.16 the day after reporting lower-than-expected revenues and giving a 2015 profit target that was below estimates. The stock was among the biggest decliners on the S&P; 500 and weighed the most on the price-weighted Dow industrials. The blue-chip index, however, got a boost from UnitedHealth Group Inc, which rose 3 percent to $108.81 after its fourth-quarter earnings topped expectations.

U.S. Treasury prices declined and the euro rose against the dollar after news reports that the ECB, which will hold a policy meeting on Thursday, plans to buy 50 billion euros ($58 billion) in bonds per month for at least one year.

Market participants have been looking for more aggressive measures from central banks to combat the risk of deflation that has grown alongside a drop in oil prices. A source told Reuters that the ECB’s Executive Board has proposed a quantitative easing program that would see the ECB buy roughly 50 billion euros ($58 billion) in bonds per month, starting in March. “The timing and duration of bond purchases is just as important as the actual amount, if not more important,” said Clem Miller, portfolio manager of Wilmington International Funds in Baltimore. “There are also a lot of questions about asset distribution, since the market is expecting a lot of government bond purchases, and it would be disappointed if it was more slanted to corporate bonds.” The day’s gains were broad, with nine of the 10 primary S&P; 500 sectors higher on the day. Energy shares were the day’s biggest outperformers, up 1.6 percent alongside a 2.8 percent surge in the price of crude oil.  Despite the gain, crude remains lower for the week after a drop of nearly 5 percent on Tuesday. Occidental Petroleum  rose 1.4 percent to $79.14 on Wednesday.

42,IBM,U.S. judge throws out insider trading guilty pleas over IBM deal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday threw out the guilty pleas of four men accused of illegally dealing in shares ahead of an IBM Corp acquisition, the first decision in response to a landmark appellate ruling curtailing prosecutors’ ability to bring certain insider trading cases. The decision raises the prospect that U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter in Manhattan could dismiss the indictment against the four men and a fifth defendant before a trial next month. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in December held that  prosecutors need to prove a trader knew that the original source of a tip received a benefit in exchange for the information. It also narrowed what constitutes a benefit, saying it cannot be only friendship. In the IBM case, prosecutors said a worker at IBM’s law firm told former Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc analyst Trent Martin in 2009 that the company planned to acquire SPSS Inc for $1.2 billion. While the friend expected Martin not to tell anyone, the RBS analyst bought SPSS stock and told his roommate, then Euro Pacific Capital Inc trader Thomas Conradt, who in turn told his colleagues, traders David Weishaus, Daryl Payton and Benjamin Durant, authorities said. Carter said the December ruling that reversed the insider trading convictions of hedge fund managers Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson deserved “utmost consideration” and applied to the case before him. He tossed out the guilty pleas of Martin, Conradt, Weishaus and Payton. Durant was scheduled to go on trial on Feb. 23. Prosecutors said that because the information in the IBM case was misappropriated from the insider and not provided directly, the Newman decision did not apply. But Carter said it “applies equally in misappropriation cases.” Prosecutors had in a Jan. 19 letter said Carter should dismiss the indictment against all five men if he applied the 2nd Circuit decision. A hearing is scheduled for Friday. Payton’s lawyer, James Roth, said he is confident that a dismissal is “mandated.” Carter’s ruling is another setback for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, whose office had since October 2009 secured 86 convictions and guilty pleas for insider trading before the appeals court decision.

44,IBM,UPDATE 1-U.S. judge throws out insider trading guilty pleas over IBM deal,"(Adds background on case, details of ruling, lawyer comment) By Nate Raymond NEW YORK, Jan 22 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday threw out the guilty pleas of four men accused of illegally dealing in shares ahead of an IBM Corp acquisition, the first decision in response to a landmark appellate ruling curtailing prosecutors’ ability to bring certain insider trading cases. The decision raises the prospect that U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter in Manhattan could dismiss the indictment against the four men and a fifth defendant before a trial next month. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in December held that  prosecutors need to prove a trader knew that the original source of a tip received a benefit in exchange for the information. It also narrowed what constitutes a benefit, saying it cannot be only friendship. In the IBM case, prosecutors said a worker at IBM’s law firm told former Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc analyst Trent Martin in 2009 that the company planned to acquire SPSS Inc for $1.2 billion. While the friend expected Martin not to tell anyone, the RBS analyst bought SPSS stock and told his roommate, then Euro Pacific Capital Inc trader Thomas Conradt, who in turn told his colleagues, traders David Weishaus, Daryl Payton and Benjamin Durant, authorities said. Carter said the December ruling that reversed the insider trading convictions of hedge fund managers Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson deserved “utmost consideration” and applied to the case before him. He tossed out the guilty pleas of Martin, Conradt, Weishaus and Payton. Durant was scheduled to go on trial on Feb. 23. Prosecutors said that because the information in the IBM case was misappropriated from the insider and not provided directly, the Newman decision did not apply. But Carter said it “applies equally in misappropriation cases.” Prosecutors had in a Jan. 19 letter said Carter should dismiss the indictment against all five men if he applied the 2nd Circuit decision. A hearing is scheduled for Friday. Payton’s lawyer, James Roth, said he is confident that a dismissal is “mandated.” Carter’s ruling is another setback for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, whose office had since October 2009 secured 86 convictions and guilty pleas for insider trading before the appeals court decision.

48,IBM,IBM dismisses Forbes report of massive layoffs,"(Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) dismissed on Monday a Forbes magazine report claiming the technology firm is preparing to cut about 26 percent of its workforce, which would represent its biggest-ever layoffs. IBM is cutting jobs, as disclosed in its latest earnings report last week, but those reductions will affect “several thousand” employees, a “small fraction” of what Forbes reported, according to an emailed statement from IBM to Reuters. Forbes had said as many as 112,000 employees could be laid off. The technology giant has been steadily reshaping its 400,000-plus staff for several years, laying off workers in some areas and hiring in new growth businesses.  A report last Thursday on Forbes’ website by pseudonymous Silicon Valley technology gossip columnist Robert Cringely said IBM planned to break with that gradual approach and suddenly lay off 26 percent of its global workforce.  IBM did not issue a categorical denial of the report, but strongly suggested it was inaccurate. “IBM does not comment on rumors, even ridiculous or baseless ones,” the company said in the email. “If anyone had checked information readily available from our public earnings statements, or had simply asked us, they would know that IBM has already announced the company has just taken a $600 million charge for workforce rebalancing. This equates to several thousand people, a small fraction of what’s been reported.” Last week, Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter told investors on IBM’s fourth-quarter earnings conference call that the company was taking restructuring charges of around $580 million, but he did not specify the number of jobs affected. “We are not going to replicate the same level of restructuring that we had last year,” Schroeter said in response to a Wall Street analyst’s question. “It will be a lower amount.”   IBM does not disclose the amount of layoffs it makes each year, but one Wall Street analyst estimated that this year’s restructuring charge suggests about 8,000 people, in line with recent years. “For each of the last seven years, IBM has taken annual restructuring charges of between about $450 million and $1.5 billion, which we estimated have resulted in workforce reductions of between 6,500 and 21,500 per year,” Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi wrote in a note to clients on Monday. He said the Forbes report was “puzzling”. IBM said it had 431,212 employees at the end of 2013, slightly down from 434,246 employees in 2012. The company has not yet disclosed its overall employee headcount for the end of 2014. IBM’s shares were up about 0.5 percent at $156.66 on the New York Stock Exchange after paring earlier gains.

49,IBM,Analysis: NY insider trading ruling tests prosecutors beyond Wall Street,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A court ruling that sharply curtailed the ability of prosecutors including Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara to pursue insider trading cases is increasingly testing regulators’ abilities across the country. Defendants in California and Massachusetts have sought to take advantage of a December ruling from the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York that narrowed the definition of insider trading, making it harder for prosecutors to pursue their cases. The challenges raise the possibility that the 2nd Circuit decision, legally binding only in New York, Connecticut and Vermont, could be adopted by other jurisdictions nationally or could create a split among the federal courts. The ruling reversed the convictions of Todd Newman, a former portfolio manager at Diamondback Capital Management, and Anthony Chiasson, co-founder of Level Global Investors. A three-judge panel held that prosecutors need to prove a trader knew the original source of a tip received a benefit in exchange for the information. It also narrowed what constitutes a benefit, saying it must be of “some consequence” and cannot be only friendship. Samuel Lieberman, a defense lawyer involved in a similar challenge, said judges across the country often look to the 2nd Circuit for guidance. “The 2nd Circuit is the leading appeals court for insider trading,” he said. “So disregarding it comes with some peril.” While the pace of prosecutions had looked set to slow from the pace of recent years, the appeals court’s ruling could slam the brakes on authorities’ efforts to pursue future cases. The decision’s effect was quickly felt in New York, where Bharara’s office on Friday filed papers asking the court to reconsider the ruling. Bharara’s office has charged 92 people with insider trading since October 2009 and had won guilty pleas or trial convictions of 86 of them, including Galleon Group hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam and former SAC Capital Advisors trader Mathew Martoma, before the 2nd Circuit ruling. Many of those cases are unlikely to be affected by the ruling, because the benefits were financial and known to the traders. But some defendants have already sought to vacate guilty pleas and reverse trial convictions in light of it. In the first decision to follow the 2nd Circuit ruling, a federal judge in Manhattan on Thursday threw out the guilty pleas of four men accused of illegally dealing in shares ahead of an IBM Corp acquisition. A spokeswoman for Bharara declined comment, but in court papers Friday, his office argued the 2nd Circuit ruling “threatens the effective enforcement of the securities laws.” The ruling is having ripple effects beyond New York. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission data shows that 52 of the 66 people charged with insider trading civilly or criminally in the 2014 fiscal year were pursued outside of New York. In Boston, for example, authorities charged a group of friends who they said exchanged non-public information about American Superconductor Corp. One of the men, Eric McPhail, learned secret information about the company from one of its senior executives, who belonged to a country club where McPhail was a member. Despite being told the information in confidence, McPhail tipped off other golfing buddies, including attorney Douglas Parigian, who reaped $300,000 in illegal profits, authorities say. McPhail and Parigian were indicted in July, after earlier being sued by the SEC, which reached settlements with four of the friends for $145,309. Both men have moved to dismiss the SEC’s case and plan to do the same in the criminal case in light of the 2nd Circuit ruling, said Allison Koury, Parigian’s lawyer. In court papers, they argue no allegations exist that the executive received what would constitute a benefit under the 2nd Circuit’s decision, and that authorities failed to allege Parigian knew about the benefit. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Boston did not respond to requests for comment. But the SEC has argued since the information was misappropriated, it has to prove a benefit flowed to McPhail, who acted as the tipper. The SEC said McPhail had made it clear he “was looking forward to getting paid back.” Prosecutors on Wednesday meanwhile filed a superseding indictment that added a line saying he received a benefit from Parigian and others. In Santa Ana, California, former Advanced Medical Optics Inc CEO James Mazzo and three co-defendants charged with insider trading filed papers arguing prosecutors failed to establish there was a tangible quid pro quo for allegedly tipping ex-Baltimore Orioles third baseman Douglas DeCinces about a deal. Prosecutors say Mazzo, a close friend of DeCinces, tipped him in advance of Abbott Laboratories’ $1.36 billion acquisition of the company, enabling him to make $1.3 million in illicit profits. DeCinces, in turn, told five other people about the deal, including his business partner David Parker and real estate lawyer Fred Jackson, who made $347,920 and $140,259 respectively trading ahead of the deal, prosecutors say. In court papers, prosecutors said the 2nd Circuit ruling is “inconsistent” with the law of the U.S. Supreme Court and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers California and other Western states. They argue that insider trading includes making a “gift” of confidential information to a relative or friend. Before the 2nd Circuit ruling, U.S. District Judge Andrew Guilford in Santa Ana previously denied a motion to dismiss by DeCinces that made similar arguments. Late on Friday, he denied the defendants’ latest motions, saying with little explanation that he was upholding his earlier decision. Lawyers for the defendants either declined comment or did not respond to requests for comment on Sunday. But at a Jan. 12 hearing, Guilford warned prosecutors that if he did not dismiss the indictment, they needed to be prepared to “pursue their strongest claims,” since the issue could still affect the case at the Feb. 3 trial or in any appeal.",1262015,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-insidertrading/analysis-ny-insider-trading-ruling-tests-prosecutors-beyond-wall-street-idUSL1N0V50K220150126

52,IBM,U.S. prosecutor to drop insider trading charges over IBM deal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors said on Thursday they will drop charges against five men accused of insider trading ahead of an IBM Corp acquisition after an appellate court ruling limited the ability of authorities to pursue such cases. At a court hearing, prosecutors in the office of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan said they would submit paperwork by Feb. 4 to drop the charges after U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter rejected their unusual request to dismiss the indictments. A dismissal by the judge would have allowed Bharara’s office to appeal Carter’s ruling last week that the December appellate court decision applied to the case. The decision resulted in the guilty pleas of four of the men being thrown out. Andrew Bauer, a prosecutor, said that as a result of the heightened legal standard, “we do not have the requisite evidence to establish one of the elements of the crime.” Defense lawyers welcomed the decision. “We’re all thrilled,” said Catherine Redlich, a lawyer for former Euro Pacific Capital Inc trader Thomas Conradt. Prosecutors said they reserved the right to refile charges later. The case was the latest setback for prosecutors following a ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that reversed the insider trading convictions of hedge fund managers Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson. The appellate court held that prosecutors must prove a trader knew that the source of a tip received a benefit in exchange for the information. It also narrowed what constitutes a benefit, saying it cannot be only friendship. Prosecutors last Friday asked the appellate court to reconsider the ruling, which has resulted in six of the 86 insider trading convictions secured by Bharara to be set aside. In the IBM case, prosecutors said a lawyer at IBM’s law firm in 2009 told Trent Martin, an analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, about IBM’s planned $1.2 billion acquisition of SPSS Inc. While the lawyer expected his friend, Martin, not to tell anyone, the analyst bought SPSS stock and told his roommate, Conradt, who in turn told Euro Pacific colleagues, traders David Weishaus, Daryl Payton and Benjamin Durant, authorities said. Carter last week cited the 2nd Circuit ruling in tossing the guilty pleas of Martin, Conradt, Weishaus and Payton ahead of a Feb. 23 trial for Durant. Prosecutors had argued the appellate ruling should not apply since the information was misappropriated from the lawyer. The case is U.S. v.

54,IBM,UPDATE 2-U.S. prosecutor to drop insider trading charges over IBM deal,"(Updates with details from court hearing) By Nate Raymond NEW YORK, Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors said on Thursday they will drop charges against five men accused of insider trading ahead of an IBM Corp acquisition after an appellate court ruling limited the ability of authorities to pursue such cases. At a court hearing, prosecutors in the office of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan said they would submit paperwork by Feb. 4 to drop the charges after U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter rejected their unusual request to dismiss the indictments. A dismissal by the judge would have allowed Bharara’s office to appeal Carter’s ruling last week that the December appellate court decision applied to the case. The decision resulted in the guilty pleas of four of the men being thrown out. Andrew Bauer, a prosecutor, said that as a result of the heightened legal standard, “we do not have the requisite evidence to establish one of the elements of the crime.” Defense lawyers welcomed the decision. “We’re all thrilled,” said Catherine Redlich, a lawyer for former Euro Pacific Capital Inc trader Thomas Conradt. Prosecutors said they reserved the right to refile charges later.

55,IBM,U.S. prepared to drop insider trading charges over IBM deal: filing,"NEW YORK, Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors said they are prepared to drop charges against five men accused of engaging in insider trading ahead of an IBM Corp acquisition, citing a major appellate court ruling limiting authorities’ abilities to pursue such cases. In an unusual letter late Wednesday, prosecutors under Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara asked U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter to dismiss the indictment. Such a decision would allow Bharara’s office to appeal Carter’s ruling last week that the December appellate court decision applied to the case, a holding that prompted the judge to throw out four of the men’s guilty pleas. But prosecutors said if Carter will not dismiss the indictment, they intend to drop the charges, saying its evidence “falls short” of the appellate court’s standards. A hearing is scheduled for later Thursday. The defendants’ lawyers and Bharara’s office did not respond to requests for comment. The case marked the latest fallout of a ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversing the insider trading convictions of hedge fund managers Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson. The 2nd Circuit held that prosecutors need to prove a trader knew that the source of a tip received a benefit in exchange for the information. It also narrowed what constitutes a benefit, saying it must be of “some consequence” and cannot be only friendship. Bharara’s office had before the ruling secured 86 people’s convictions for insider trading since October 2009. Prosecutors on Friday asked the 2nd Circuit to reconsider the ruling, saying it will “dramatically limit” authorities’ abilities to pursue insider trading cases. In the IBM case, prosecutors said a lawyer at IBM’s law firm told former Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc analyst Trent Martin in 2009 about the company’s planned acquisition of SPSS Inc for $1.2 billion. While the friend expected Martin not to tell anyone, the analyst bought SPSS stock and told his roommate, then Euro Pacific Capital Inc trader Thomas Conradt, who in turn told his colleagues, traders David Weishaus, Daryl Payton and Benjamin Durant, authorities said. Carter last week in light of the 2nd Circuit ruling tossed the guilty pleas of Martin, Conradt, Weishaus and Payton ahead of a Feb. 23 trial for Durant.

56,IBM,IBM brings back bonuses for top execs even as profits slide,"SEATTLE (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp brought back annual performance bonuses for its chief executive and her top lieutenants for 2014 despite falling profits and a tumbling stock price, a regulatory filing showed on Friday. The technology company, which has posted lower profits for 11 quarters in a row as it struggles to transform itself into a cloud-based software and services company, withheld annual bonuses in 2013 at the executives’ own request. The bonuses returned as a feature of IBM’s executive compensation for 2014, according to a document filed with securities regulators on Friday, despite the fact that IBM’s net profit from continuing operations fell 7 percent last year and its stock shed about 14 percent. IBM CEO Virginia Rometty will get a $3.6 million annual incentive payout for 2014, according to the filing. Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter and three other executives or advisers were also listed as getting smaller annual incentive payouts. Rometty is slated to receive a base salary of $1.6 million for 2015, her first raise from the $1.5 million she got each of the last three years after taking up the post of CEO at the beginning of 2012.   Rometty is also slated to receive a target annual incentive award of $5 million for 2015 and a long-term stock grant worth $13.3 million, which would be payable in 2018, according to the filing. The company last year withdrew its long-term plan to hit $20 per share in operating earnings for 2015 as it faltered in its move away from hardware to focus on higher-margin businesses such as security software and cloud services.

61,IBM,IBM sues Priceline for patent infringement in U.S. court,"WASHINGTON, Feb 9 (Reuters) - IBM filed a lawsuit against Priceline Group Inc on Monday, accusing it of infringing four IBM patents in running its travel and dining websites. International Business Machines Corp asked the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware to bar Priceline from using the patents, to award IBM royalties and to order Priceline to pay IBM’s costs and attorney’s fees. IBM also said that the infringement was willful, and asked for all damages to be trebled. IBM said it had approached Priceline about the alleged infringement. “Despite IBM’s repeated demands, Priceline refuses to negotiate a license. This lawsuit seeks to stop Priceline from continuing to use IBM’s intellectual property without authorization,” IBM said in its complaint. Two of the IBM patents are from the late 1990s, one which tracks prior conversations with a user and another which speeds Internet transmissions. The third patent is from 2006 and is a method of showing Internet advertising; a fourth from 2009 improves on a single sign-on. Priceline also used the patented technology on its websites kayak.com and opentable.com, IBM alleged. Priceline was not immediately available for comment. The case is at the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. It is International Business Machines Corp v. The Priceline Group Inc, and is No. 15-00137.

62,IBM,"IBM targets $40 billion in cloud, other growth areas by 2018","(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N), which ruled computing in the age of the mainframe, is targeting $40 billion in annual revenue from the cloud, big data, security and other growth areas by 2018. The aggressive target, set by IBM executives at the company’s annual investor meeting in New York on Thursday, is the latest step for the technology giant towards emerging, high-margin businesses, and away from its previous strongholds in hardware and servers. The $40 billion will come from areas which IBM calls its “strategic imperatives,” namely cloud, analytics, mobile, social and security software.  That would represent about 44 percent of $90 billion in total revenue that analysts expect from IBM in 2018.  Those businesses generated $25 billion in revenue for IBM last year, or 27 percent of its total $93 billion in sales. The company said it would shift $4 billion in spending to its “strategic imperatives” this year.

IBM Chief Executive Virginia Rometty has said she was happy to jettison revenue from such unprofitable businesses, which she dubs “empty calories.”  IBM revenue has now fallen for the past 11 quarters, while earnings growth has been sporadic.  The company says its long-term plan is to hit “low single-digit” revenue growth and “high single-digit” growth in operating earnings per share. Last year IBM withdrew its long-term plan to hit $20 per share in operating earnings for 2015. IBM stood by its January forecast of $15.75 to $16.50 in operating earnings per share for 2015.

The lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court arose from IBM’s announcement last Oct. 20 that it would sell the unit to GlobalFoundries Inc, and take a related $4.7 billion pre-tax charge. IBM also announced third-quarter results that day. Its share price fell 9 percent over the next two trading days, wiping out more than $18 billion of market value. The Armonk, New York-based company did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the suit. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc is among IBM’s largest shareholders. According to the complaint, IBM inflated its stock price before selling the semiconductor unit by carrying the unit’s property, plant and equipment assets on its books at $2.4 billion, when it should have known the assets were worthless. The complaint said potential bidders had been unwilling to pay much more than $1 billion for the entire unit, including intellectual property and personnel, suggesting that the hard assets had no or negative market value. The lawsuit by the City of Sterling Heights Police & Fire Retirement System in Michigan also named three IBM officials as defendants, including Chief Executive Virginia Rometty.

68,IBM,"IBM shareholder sues company, alleging it overvalued chip unit","NEW YORK, March 2 (Reuters) - IBM Corp was sued on Monday by a shareholder that said it committed securities fraud by failing to write down a money-losing semiconductor unit before agreeing to pay another company $1.5 billion to take that unit off its hands. The lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court arose from IBM’s announcement last Oct. 20 that it would sell the unit to GlobalFoundries Inc, and take a related $4.7 billion pre-tax charge. IBM also announced third-quarter results that day. Its share price fell 9 percent over the next two trading days, wiping out more than $18 billion of market value. The Armonk, New York-based company did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the suit. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc is among IBM’s largest shareholders. According to the complaint, IBM inflated its stock price before selling the semiconductor unit by carrying the unit’s property, plant and equipment assets on its books at $2.4 billion, when it should have known the assets were worthless. The complaint said potential bidders had been unwilling to pay much more than $1 billion for the entire unit, including intellectual property and personnel, suggesting that the hard assets had no or negative market value. The lawsuit by the City of Sterling Heights Police & Fire Retirement System in Michigan also named three IBM officials as defendants, including Chief Executive Virginia Rometty.

69,IBM,Ericsson joins with Intel to help telecoms firms get in the cloud,"BARCELONA (Reuters) - Telecom equipment maker Ericsson and chipmaker Intel have agreed a partnership deal to help network operator customers build datacenters, putting them on a more competitive footing against big, cloud-based Internet firms such as Google, Facebook and Amazon. “We will build datacenter equipment which will actually have the same performance as many of the big cloud providers are doing for themselves,” Ericsson’s chief executive, Hans Vestberg, told a news conference at the Mobile World Congress telecoms trade show in Barcelona on Monday. Ericsson, the world’s leading maker of mobile network equipment, said it will help its global base of major telecoms companies to shift to cloud computing using Intel datacenter designs to compete more actively with Web rivals. No financial terms of the partnership were disclosed. Over the past decade Web-based services like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft have stopped buying finished computers, storage devices and network components and instead developed their own systems in-house to create massive, low-cost datacenters in the cloud to serve billions of users. Ericsson’s partnership with Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, puts it in a crowded market for providing bespoke datacenters, where it will also be competing with a range of technology suppliers including Cisco and IBM.  The Swedish company’s plan is to focus initially on equipping big telecom operators rather than competing for new corporate customers in other industries, its CEO said. Telecom operators are rushing to build datacenters in the cloud to slash the cost of hardware spending within their networks, improve the range of services they offer subscribers and to obtain the Web-wide reach of the big Internet companies. “The difference is that we are going to provide it to the market,” Vestberg said. “This is predominately to see that we give a competitive edge for our customers, the carriers.” The move builds on a number of smaller cloud software company acquisitions made by Ericsson over the past year.

71,IBM,"Buffett says 'no jockeying' between Jain, Abel for top post: CNBC","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett, the billionaire chief executive officer and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), told CNBC on Monday that Berkshire executives Ajit Jain and Greg Abel were not angling for the top Berkshire job.    In Berkshire’s annual report to shareholders on Saturday, Vice Chairman Charlie Munger hinted that Jain, a top insurance executive, and Abel, the head of Berkshire’s energy companies, were top candidates to succeed Buffett. “There’s no jockeying position at all” between Jain and Abel, Buffett said on CNBC. Speculation has mounted among Berkshire investors over who will eventually succeed the 84-year-old Buffett.  The field was narrowed in the annual Berkshire letter, when Buffett said he and the board had found his successor, and Munger wrote that Abel and Jain were “proven performers who would probably be under-described as ‘world-class.’” “‘World-leading’ would be the description I would choose,” Munger said in a separate letter to shareholders, also on Saturday. “In some important ways, each is a better business executive than Buffett.” On Monday, Buffett said: “When Charlie’s letter came in and it referenced Greg and Ajit, it was news to me that he was writing that.” “He’s right. They’re very, very, very good, each one of them.” Munger, whom Buffett describes as “my partner,” is 91. Asked if Abel, 52, and Jain, 63, were aware of who the next successor would be, Buffett said: “No.” “We have a precise plan in mind, very detailed, as to what happens later today if I pass out on this show or something of the sort,” he said. “It’s all in place, and it wouldn’t take 24 hours to implement.”  Neither Buffett’s nor Munger’s letters referred by name to Matthew Rose, 55, executive chairman of the BNSF railroad unit, who has also been mentioned by investors as a possible successor. Buffett told CNBC that Rose was not out of the race for potential chief executive officer. In his letter on Saturday, Buffett said age would also be a factor and that Berkshire might be better off if his successor were to stay on for at least a decade. On investing, Buffett said Berkshire was continuing to stick with IBM shares, the Dow Jones industrial average’s worst performer in 2014, “because I like it.” As of Dec. 31, Berkshire held a 7.79 percent stake in IBM.  “There have been no surprises at IBM since we started buying it a few years ago,” Buffett said. “We expected revenue to come down.

74,IBM,Cybersecurity company Novetta Solutions up for sale -sources,"March 3 (Reuters) - Novetta Solutions LLC, a provider of software and IT services to the U.S. intelligence community, is exploring a sale which could value it at more than $650 million, including debt, according to people familiar with the matter. Novetta’s sale process comes as cuts in U.S. government spending, particularly in the areas of defense and security, have hit companies that rely on government contracts, spurring consolidation in the industry. Arlington Capital Partners, Novetta’s private equity owner, has hired investment banks Morgan Stanley and Houlihan Lokey on an auction for the company, the people said this week. Novetta has annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of between $40 million and $50 million, the people added. The sources asked not to be identified because the sale process is not public. Representatives for Novetta, Arlington Capital Partners, Morgan Stanley and Houlihan Lokey declined to comment. McLean, Virginia-based Novetta offers data analytics services to government clients working with large sets of data. Its customers include national intelligence agencies, the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Technology companies Hewlett-Packard Co and IBM Corp , as well as defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin Corp, Raytheon Co and General Dynamics Corp , could show interest in Novetta, according to the sources. Representatives from General Dynamics, Hewlett-Packard, Lockheed Martin, and IBM declined to comment. Raytheon did not respond to a request for comment. A deal for Novetta would be just the latest example of a private equity firm selling a government services portfolio company. Last month, government services contractor Engility Holdings Inc, acquired TASC, a provider of professional services to government agencies for $1.3 billion. TASC was controlled by affiliates of the private equity firms KKR & Co LP and General Atlantic LLC. On Sunday, Science Applications International Corp  a provider of information technology and engineering services to governments, said it would acquire Scitor Corp, a smaller peer, for $790 million.

75,IBM,IBM buys AlchemyAPI to boost Watson computing unit,"SEATTLE (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp said on Wednesday it had acquired AlchemyAPI, a fast-growing startup selling software that collects and analyzes unstructured text and data in ways big enterprises, website publishers and advertisers find useful. The purchase is designed to boost IBM’s push into more human-like computing services, based around its Watson technology, which can sift huge amounts of data, learn from the results and respond to spoken questions. IBM is trying to build a big business around Watson, which came to prominence in 2011 when it beat two previous champions on the U.S. quiz show Jeopardy. IBM gives developers access to Watson so they can use the technology in their own applications,  but it has only just started to filter down to mainstream use. AlchemyAPI already has about 40,000 developers building tools using its technology, which would give IBM access to a much bigger, ready-made user base. “They (AlchemyAPI) bring a very substantial development community and following,” said Steve Gold, vice president of IBM’s Watson group. “Plus, they have a very talented group of technologists.”  AlchemyAPI, founded in 2005 and based in Denver, has 18 full-time employees. Its customers include publishing company Hearst Corp and image agency Shutterstock. IBM did not disclose the purchase price.  The startup’s software gathers data from a wide range of sources, from Twitter posts and news stories to website images and text messages, sorts the data, learns to differentiate between them, and allows users to see connections that would take much longer to establish using more standard computing methods. The software, which learns as it goes, enables users to group together disparate information on a certain topic or event, find related articles or information sources, and helps advertisers target online ads better.  With the addition of AlchemyAPI’s technology, Gold said IBM sees opportunities for Watson in many fields such as healthcare, law and insurance, or wherever there are large volumes of unstructured data to be analyzed.  AlchemyAPI is IBM’s second acquisition in the field after it bought artificial intelligence startup Cognea last year, which pioneered virtual assistant apps for smartphones.

77,IBM,"Huawei, Intel expand tie-up amid China's rising scrutiny of U.S. tech firms","BEIJING, March 5 (Reuters) - China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and Intel Corp are expanding an existing alliance to provide cloud computing to global telecoms carriers, as U.S. tech firms vie for Chinese tie-ups to retain access to a tough mainland market. The partnership, announced by Huawei in a statement, comes as U.S and other Western tech firms’ scramble to burnish their bona fides with China, which has become increasingly wary of foreign technology. Joining hands with Chinese companies, including technology transfers and adopting Chinese partners’ branding, can make these products more palatable to local buyers and authorities in the world’s second-largest economy. “How do you stay in this market and do the least damage to your core business - that’s the puzzle everybody is focusing on now,” said James McGregor, chairman for advisory firm APCO China. China’s government has been openly pushing for the use of more Chinese and less foreign-made technology, both to grow its own tech sector and as a response to former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden’s leaks about widespread U.S. cyber surveillance. These policies have become a source of considerable friction in foreign relations. Earlier this week, U.S. President Barack Obama warned of a proposed anti-terrorism law’s impact on technology firms and international business, and demanded amendments. Other U.S. enterprise tech firms adopting a partnership strategy include IBM Corp, Dell Inc, Cisco Systems Inc, Hewlett-Packard Co and Juniper Networks Inc. The cloud computing industry is a focus area for China, with Premier Li Keqiang saying in his government work report delivered to parliament on Thursday that the government would support its development. Intel and Huawei have collaborated previously, including a server and cloud product team-up in 2012 and an agreement to cooperate on data storage last April.

78,IBM,Exclusive: IBM looking at adopting bitcoin technology for major currencies,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp is considering adopting the underlying technology behind bitcoin, known as the “blockchain,” to create a digital cash and payment system for major currencies, according to a person familiar with the matter. The objective is to allow people to transfer cash or make payments instantaneously using this technology without a bank or clearing party involved, saving on transaction costs, the person said. The transactions would be in an open ledger of a specific country’s currency such as the dollar or euro, said the source,  who declined to be identified because of a lack of authorization to discuss the project in public. The blockchain - a ledger, or list, of all of a digital currency’s transactions - is viewed as bitcoin’s main technological innovation, allowing users to make payments anonymously, instantly, and without government regulation.  Rather than stored on a separate server and controlled by an individual, company, or bank, the ledger is open and accessible to all participants in the bitcoin network.  The proposed digital currency system would work in a similar way. “When somebody wants to transact in the system, instead of you trying to acquire a bitcoin, you simply say, here are some U.S. dollars,” the source said. “It’s sort of a bitcoin but without the bitcoin.” IBM is one of a number of tech companies looking to expand the use of the blockchain technology beyond bitcoin, the digital currency launched six years ago that has spurred a following among investors and tech enthusiasts. The company has been in informal discussions about a blockchain-tied cash system with a number of central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, the source said. If central banks approve the concept, IBM will build the secure and scalable infrastructure for the project. IBM media relations office did not respond to Reuters emails about this story and the Fed declined to comment.  However, there are signs that central banks are already thinking about the innovations that could arise through digital currency systems. The Bank of England, in a report in September 2014, described the blockchain’s open ledger as a “significant innovation” that could transform the financial system more generally.  Instead of having ledgers maintained by banks that act as a record of an individual’s transactions, this kind of open ledger would be viewable by everyone using the system, and would use an agreed-upon process for entering transactions into the system. The project is still in the early stages and constantly evolving, the source said. It is also unclear how concerns about money-laundering and criminal activities that have hamstrung bitcoin.  Unlike bitcoin, where the network is decentralized and there is no overseer, the proposed digital currency system would be controlled by central banks, the source said.  “These coins will be part of the money supply,” the source said. “It’s the same money, just not a dollar bill with a serial number on it, but a token that sits on this blockchain.” According to the plans, the digital currency could be linked to a person’s bank account, possibly using a wallet software that would integrate that account with the proposed digital currency ledger.  “We are at a tipping point right now. It’s making a lot more sense for some type of digital cash in the system, that not only saves our government money, but also is a lot more convenient and secure for individuals to use,” the source said.

83,IBM,IBM to share technology with China in strategy shift: CEO,"BEIJING (Reuters) - IBM Corp will share technology with Chinese firms and will actively help build China’s industry, CEO Virginia Rometty said in Beijing as she set out a strategy for one of the foreign firms hardest hit by China’s shifting technology policies. IBM must help China build its IT industry rather than viewing the country solely as a sales destination or manufacturing base, Rometty said at the China Development Forum, an annual Chinese government-sponsored conference bringing together business executives and China’s ruling elite. “If you’re a country, as China is, of 1.3 billion people you would want an IT industry as well,” the chief executive said on Monday. “I think some firms find that perhaps frightening. We, though, at IBM ... find that to be a great opportunity.” Rometty’s remarks were among the clearest acknowledgements to date by a high-ranking foreign technology executive that companies must adopt a different tack if they are to continue in China amid growing political pressure. A number of U.S. technology companies operating in China are forming alliances with domestic operators, hoping a local partner will make it easier to operate in the increasingly tough environment for foreign businesses.

84,IBM,IBM to share technology with China in strategy shift -CEO,"BEIJING, March 23 (Reuters) - IBM Corp will share technology with Chinese firms and will actively help build China’s industry, CEO Virginia Rometty said in Beijing as she set out a strategy for one of the foreign firms hardest hit by China’s shifting technology policies. IBM must help China build its IT industry rather than viewing the country solely as a sales destination or manufacturing base, Rometty said at the China Development Forum, an annual Chinese government-sponsored conference bringing together business executives and China’s ruling elite. “If you’re a country, as China is, of 1.3 billion people you would want an IT industry as well,” the chief executive said on Monday. “I think some firms find that perhaps frightening. We, though, at IBM ... find that to be a great opportunity.” Rometty’s remarks were among the clearest acknowledgements to date by a high-ranking foreign technology executive that companies must adopt a different tack if they are to continue in China amid growing political pressure. A number of U.S. technology companies operating in China are forming alliances with domestic operators, hoping a local partner will make it easier to operate in the increasingly tough environment for foreign businesses.

85,IBM,New apps to help business get in step with mobile customers,"FRANKFURT, March 27 (Reuters) - Nine months after Apple  and IBM began working together on building mobile apps for businesses, some of the first fruits are about to appear at UK pharmacy chain Boots, which has begun equipping store employees with iPads to serve shoppers in the aisles. These customer service apps are part of a bid by Boots to encourage consumers to pre-order cosmetics and toiletries online, similar to calling ahead for medical prescriptions, while turning its 2,500 retail outlets into convenient pick-up points. “These apps put all of Boots’ inventory at (employees’) fingertips,” said Robin Phillps, who is in charge of digital and e-commerce business at the company, now part of Walgreens Boots Alliance. “This makes it easier for them ... to interact with customers on their own terms.” Companies across dozens of different industries are now eyeing how these mobile business apps from Apple and IBM can hook up front-line staff to back-office systems and make them smarter in face-to-face dealings with customers in the field. Businesses which first invested heavily in apps for mobile shoppers have just begun to put customer-service employees on an equally mobile footing, Forrester Research said in a report this month on the phenomenon. With many companies’ in-house technical staff struggling to keep pace with the ways their employees use mobile phones, Apple and IBM are part of a growing market for supplying business and government organisations with a new class of apps for employees on the move. Technology consultants Accenture, Cap Gemini  and Deloitte are also top suppliers to this changing way of doing business, along with dozens of other service providers and hundreds of custom designer app firms. IBM says it now has more than 200 global companies gearing up to use mobile phone apps through its partnership with Apple.  These include U.S. banking group Citi and Banorte  of Mexico, Air Canada, and retailers American Eagle Outfitters and Boots UK. The partnership has announced 14 app templates so far, which IBM then works with clients to customise with specific company data and analytics. Each app lets employees look up customer profiles and answer questions on the go rather than anchoring them to counter terminals as most businesses typically do. “We are trying to bring that same ‘wow’ factor, the same changes we have had in our personal lives, to our working lives,” said Katharyn White, IBM’s global sales and marketing lead for the IBM-Apple partnership. The goal is to create 100 business apps running on iPhones or iPads by the end of this year, White said. Companies pay a monthly subscription fee per device running the app, plus the costs of the secure iPhones or iPads running the software, as well as for services to hook them up to back-office systems. For the airline industry, these apps will let flight attendants help passengers rebook flights in mid-air. Financial service apps allow bankers, wealth advisors or insurance agents to make on-the-spot account decisions with clients in the field. Other Apple-IBM apps give police secure, instant access on iPhones to crime-scene maps, video feeds and suspect profiles. Besides design expertise for the apps themselves, Apple provides remote technical support for a company’s own technology departments managing the apps. And as part of the deal IBM sells iPhones and iPads along with the business apps, a potentially important new revenue stream for Apple as big businesses begin to mobilise more of their workforces. For IBM, which has software and design teams developing the MobileFirst apps, the apps themselves also take corporate and government customers to a range of IBM services — technical support, mobile device management, back-office software integration and cloud computing. At Boots UK the retailer plans to introduce the business apps in hundreds of pharmacies to employees equipped with 4,000 iPads it has purchased so far. Boots also plans to make Wi-Fi ubiquitous in its pharmacies, both for employees using the business apps and for shoppers on their phones. Currently 7.5 million shoppers visit Boots stores each week while 2.7 computer and phone users research and purchase goods via its online sites. About one-third of online shoppers, or around 1 million consumers, do so using mobile phones, so far. The aim is to get customers to order the bulk of their goods online and then pick them up the next morning at local pharmacies, Phillips said. Employee apps complement this mission with a means of interacting with in-store customers. Its Sales Assist app, which provides an internal version of the company’s public e-ecommerce site, enables Boots employees to serve shoppers in the aisles and eventually they will also be able to take payments with a quick swipe of the customer’s  phone. “The direction we are moving is purchasing in the aisles,” Phillips says, adding that the goal is to remove the check-out till as a barrier to buying.

86,IBM,SAP co-founder Klaus Tschira dies,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Klaus Tschira, one of the co-founders of European software giant SAP, has died unexpectedly at the age of 74, his foundation said on Tuesday. Tschira, a trained physicist, left IBM to found SAP in 1972 together with four IBM colleagues: Hasso Plattner, who is still the company’s chairman, Dietmar Hopp, Hans-Werner Hector and Claus Wellenreuther. The German business software company began by developing software that could process data in real time rather than overnight in batches, and went public in 1988. It is now Europe’s biggest technology company, with revenue of 17.6 billion euros ($18.9 billion), market capitalization of 82.3 billion euros and more than 74,000 employees in 2014. Tschira, a billionaire, stepped down from SAP’s supervisory board in 2007. He was married to Gerda Tschira and had two sons.

87,IBM,IBM says to invest $3 billion in 'Internet of Things' unit,"(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp said on Tuesday it will invest $3 billion over the next four years in a new ‘Internet of Things’ unit, aiming to sell its expertise in gathering and making sense of the surge in real-time data. The Armonk, New York-based technology company said its services will be based remotely in the cloud, and offer companies ways to make use of the new and multiplying sources of data such as building sensors, smartphones and home appliances to enhance their own products. For its first major partnership, IBM said a unit of the Weather Co will move its weather data services onto IBM’s cloud, so that customers can use the data in tandem with IBM’s analytics tools.  As a result, IBM is hoping that companies will be able to combine live weather forecasting with a range of business data, so companies can quickly adapt to customer buying patterns or supply chain issues connected to the weather.   For example, insurance companies could send messages to policyholders in certain areas when hailstorms are approaching and tell them safe places to park, saving money all round.  Or retail stores could compare weather forecasts with past data to predict surges or drop-offs in customer buying due to extreme weather, and to adjust staffing and supply chain logistics accordingly. IBM said it was already working with some large companies, such as German tire maker Continental AG and jet engine maker Pratt & Whitney to help them use data in their processes.  Focusing on the cloud is part of IBM’s gradual shift away from its traditional hardware and consulting business. The company is targeting $40 billion in annual revenue from the cloud, big data, security and other growth areas by 2018, which should be about 45 percent of its total revenue at that time, based on analysts’ growth estimates.

89,IBM,"IBM uncovers new, sophisticated bank transfer cyber scam","SEATTLE (Reuters) - IBM has uncovered a sophisticated fraud scheme run by a well- funded Eastern European gang of cyber criminals that uses a combination of phishing, malware and phone calls that the technology company says has netted more than $1 million from large and medium-sized U.S. companies. The scheme, which IBM security researchers have dubbed “The Dyre Wolf,” is small in comparison with more recent widespread online fraud schemes but represents a new level of sophistication.  According to IBM, since last year the attackers have been targeting people working in companies by sending spam email with unsafe attachments to get a variant of the malware known as Dyre into as many computers as possible. If installed, the malware waits until it recognizes that the user is navigating to a bank website and instantly creates a  fake screen telling the user that the bank’s site is having problems and to call a certain number.  If users call that number, they get through to an English-speaking operator who already knows what bank the users think they are contacting. The operator then elicits the users’ banking details and immediately starts a large wire transfer to take money out of the relevant account. The use of a live phone operator is what makes the scheme  unique, said Caleb Barlow, vice president of IBM Security. “What’s very different in this case, is we saw a pivot of  the attackers to use a set of social engineering techniques that I think are unprecedented,” said Barlow. “The focus on wire transfers of large sums of money really got our attention.”   IBM did not release any details on which companies fell prey to the scheme or the location of the perpetrators. Once the transfer is complete, the money is then quickly moved from bank to bank to evade detection. In one instance, IBM said, the gang hit the victim company with a denial of service attack - essentially bringing down their Web capabilities - so it would not discover the theft until much later.  International Business Machines Corp’s security unit is recommending that companies make sure employees are trained in spotting phishing attacks - where emails or attachments can infect a computer - and to never provide banking credentials to anyone.  The unit published a blog on the issue on its site. ",4022015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyberattack-ibm/ibm-uncovers-new-sophisticated-bank-transfer-cyber-scam-idUSKBN0MT28Z20150402
90,IBM,Exclusive: IBM hired advisers to deal with restless investors - sources,"NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - Some top shareholders of IBM, disappointed by 11 straight quarters of falling revenues, are seeking help from activist investors to shake up the company, but have been turned down by both Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square and Jeffrey Ubben’s ValueAct, according to people with knowledge of the matter. International Business Machines Corp is concerned about a possible attack by prominent activist hedge funds, and is working with two investment banks to formulate a defense plan, according to the people, who declined to be identified. When asked for comment, IBM said: “IBM is continuing to execute on our strategy - making investments in growth areas such as analytics and cloud, reinventing our core franchises, and returning capital to shareholders. We are managing the company for the long term.” The storied American technology giant, worth about $160 billion currently, has struggled to transform itself from a low-margin hardware maker into a cloud-based software and services company. When Virginia Rometty took over as chief executive at the start of 2012, Wall Street was hopeful that she would be able to kickstart growth. Analysts praised the former systems engineer for her strategic thinking in guiding IBM’s acquisition of PricewaterhouseCoopers Coopers Consulting in 2002.  As revenues continued to decline year on year, however, some IBM investors began to lose confidence management, according to people familiar with the matter. Last year, IBM withdrew its long-term operating earnings target for 2015, and shares of Big Blue are now down about 25 percent from a March 2013 high. Some IBM shareholders are trying to persuade prominent activists to build positions in the company and come up with ways to boost value, people familiar with the matter said.  Pershing Square and ValueAct Capital both looked at IBM in recent months, but passed on making a move, the people said. A spokesman for Pershing Square declined to comment. ValueAct did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Part of the activist funds’ concern was that IBM is too expensive and the company’s structural problems could not be fixed easily, according to several sources. The stock was up 1.2 percent at $161.09 in late trading on Friday. Another reason, the sources said, is that some investors feel Rometty is doing a good job coping with a tough situation, so she does not fit the role of an underperforming CEO that many activists look for when they make a move. Once best-known for mainframe computers, IBM has been pivoting to security software and cloud services, but growth in those areas has not fully offset weakness elsewhere. Revenue in 2014 fell to $93 billion, from $107 billion in 2011.  IBM in said in February it is targeting $40 billion annual revenue from the cloud, big data, security and other areas by 2018. It has divested about $7 billion in commoditized IT assets, such as call centers and chip manufacturing, and announced multibillion dollar investments in cloud data centers and its Watson supercomputer system.  It is not unusual for investors and consultants to try and shop companies to activists. At a time when stock picking is becoming tougher, pressuring companies to buy back shares, spin off units, or replace a CEO can be appealing. There are currently no discussions between IBM and any activist investor, two of the sources said. Still, the company’s advisers are educating IBM’s board on how to handle an activist and to conduct a strategic alternative analysis, they said. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc is a top investor in IBM. With Buffett often siding with management, his presence may make it less appealing for activists to jump in. “These days no company is safe from an activist looking at it,” said Damien Park, who works with large corporations as head of consulting group Hedge Fund Solutions. “Everyone is on the list and either you already have been approached by an activist or you will be approached by an activist.”     The $20 billion Pershing Square helped breathe new life into Canada’s No.2 railway, Canadian Pacific, and the $15 billion ValueAct helped engineer a leadership change at Microsoft Corp. ValueAct sits on the board of Microsoft, which competes with IBM in some markets. ValueAct may have faced a conflict of interest if it were to take action on IBM. Other large technology companies that have come under attack from activists in recent years include Apple Inc and eBay Inc, both targeted by Carl Icahn; Relational Investor LLC took aim at Hewlett-Packard Co; and Elliott Management Corp is pressing EMC Corp to spin off VMware Inc.

Once best-known for mainframe computers, IBM has been pivoting to security software and cloud services, but growth in those areas has not fully offset weakness elsewhere. Revenue in 2014 fell to $93 billion, from $107 billion in 2011.  The company, which earns more than two-thirds of its revenue outside of the United States, has been hit hard by the strong dollar and it divested some $7 billion last year. Adjusted for these two factors, revenues were down roughly 1 percent last year, the company noted. Also the company posted $21 billion in pre-tax profit from continuing operations in 2014.  IBM in said in February it is targeting $40 billion annual revenue from the cloud, big data, security and other areas by 2018. It has divested about $7 billion in commoditized IT assets, such as call centers and chip manufacturing, and announced multibillion dollar investments in cloud data centers and its Watson supercomputer system. It is not unusual for investors and consultants to try and shop companies to activists. At a time when stock picking is becoming tougher, pressuring companies to buy back shares, spin off units, or replace a CEO can be appealing. There are currently no discussions between IBM and any activist investor, two of the sources said. Still, the company’s advisers are educating IBM’s board on how to handle an activist and to conduct a strategic alternative analysis, they said. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) is a top investor in IBM. With Buffett often siding with management, his presence may make it less appealing for activists to jump in. “These days no company is safe from an activist looking at it,” said Damien Park, who works with large corporations as head of consulting group Hedge Fund Solutions. “Everyone is on the list and either you already have been approached by an activist or you will be approached by an activist.”     The $20 billion Pershing Square helped breathe new life into Canada’s No.2 railway, Canadian Pacific (CP.TO), and the $15 billion ValueAct helped engineer a leadership change at Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O). ValueAct sits on the board of Microsoft, which competes with IBM in some markets. ValueAct may have faced a conflict of interest if it were to take action on IBM. Other large technology companies that have come under attack from activists in recent years include Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and eBay Inc (EBAY.O), both targeted by Carl Icahn; Relational Investor LLC took aim at Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N); and Elliott Management Corp is pressing EMC Corp EMC.N to spin off VMware Inc (VMW.N).

96,IBM,UPDATE 2-U.S. prosecutors lose bid to reverse major insider trading ruling,"(Updates with further comment from lawyers) By Nate Raymond NEW YORK, April 3 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday rejected a request by federal prosecutors to reconsider a major ruling that curtailed their ability to pursue insider trading cases and jeopardized several convictions. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York denied a petition by prosecutors to grant a rehearing in the case of hedge fund managers Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson, who in December won the reversal of their insider trading convictions. The court gave no explanation for why a rehearing was rejected by both the original three-judge panel and by the full  2nd Circuit, potentially 16 judges. It was unclear if the government would within 90 days seek U.S. Supreme Court review. A spokeswoman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara declined to comment. “It is now time for the government to move on and allow an innocent man to continue with his life,” Stephen Fishbein and John Nathanson, lawyers for Newman, said in a statement. Friday’s ruling marked the latest setback for an insider trading crackdown by Bharara’s office that has since 2009 resulted in charges against 93 people. Bharara’s office and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had said the December ruling threatened their ability  to pursue insider trading. The three-judge panel held that prosecutors must prove a trader knew a tip’s source received a benefit in exchange for the information. The court also narrowed what constitutes a benefit, saying it must be of “some consequence” and cannot be only friendship. The ruling reversed the 2012 convictions of Newman, a former Diamondback Capital Management portfolio manager, and Chiasson, co-founder of Level Global Investors. Newman and Chiasson had been sentenced to 4-1/2 years and 6-1/2 years in prison, respectively, for engaging in a $72 million scheme involving insider tips about Dell Inc and Nvidia Corp. Gregory Morvillo, Chiasson’s lawyer, said his client hopes  the case becomes a “cautionary story” about the consequences of pursuing legally-novel prosecutions. Already, the December ruling has been seized upon by other defendants, and has prompted Bharara’s office to drop charges against five men accused of insider trading ahead of an IBM Corp acquisition. The ruling could also benefit Michael Steinberg, a SAC Capital Advisors portfolio manager sentenced to 3-1/2 years in prison after his 2013 conviction for engaging in the same conspiracy as Newman and Chiasson. Barry Berke, Steinberg’s lawyer, said Friday’s decision “requires his conviction to be thrown out as well.” The case is U.S. v. Newman, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 13-1837.

107,IBM,"Peugeot, IBM working to connect cars to shops and servicing","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - PSA Peugeot Citroen (PEUP.PA) and IBM (IBM.N) are working together to hook cars up to the Internet, going beyond mapping and infotainment to link vehicles up to shops, service networks and urban transport grids, the companies said on Wednesday.  Financial terms of the new, seven-year partnership were not disclosed. The agreement to develop new types of valued-added services for vehicles builds on an initial partnership between the automaker and technology consultant announced a year ago. The companies said in a joint statement they planned to develop services for drivers and passengers, as well as back-end applications that could perform preventive car maintenance and traffic management functions. The partnership looks beyond existing driver navigation, roadside assistance and infotainment offerings popularized by tech firms such as Google (GOOGL.O) and Apple (AAPL.O), and map services from Nokia’s K1V.HE> HERE unit and TomTom (TOM2.AS).  Software analytics from the car and tapping into smart grids of sensors on traffic signs and streetlights could help manage congestion and cut down on pollution, as well as feeding back to service networks for preventive car maintenance programs. It could also link vehicles to retailers, an IBM executive said. Axel Rogaichus, head of IBM’s automotive consulting practice in Europe, told Reuters it was one of the largest partnerships the computer services supplier had agreed so far in the automotive industry.  IBM reached a separate partnership agreement in 2013 with Germany’s Continental AG (CONG.DE), a top global auto parts supplier, to build an “electronic horizon” platform that enables cars to anticipate upcoming obstructions, for example. IBM and PSA, Europe’s second largest carmaker, said they had agreed to share responsibilities for developing, selling and marketing, and implementing connected services with new and existing clients of the firms.  The companies said they had established a center to work together in Paris to develop the new range of services. The latest deal focuses on connecting passenger vehicles into a variety of network-connected platforms that IBM is developing with other auto industry partners.  But Rogaichus stopped short of saying whether Peugeot might consider working with other automakers to advance urban smartgrids and other remote, connected-car functions.

IBM  shares rose 1.9 percent and were the biggest positive influence on the Dow after the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 18 percent. Losses in Apple shares weighed on the Nasdaq. Data showing U.S. single-family home prices rose more than expected in February contributed to the afternoon rebound, although the data was released earlier in the session when some weak corporate results depressed U.S. shares. “The market, in between the earnings reports, is still always looking at the macro trends,” said Margaret Patel, senior portfolio manager at Wells Capital Management in Boston. “The housing numbers were very positive for the economy.” In Europe, however, disappointing corporate earnings handed shares their biggest daily decline in over a week, with paper maker UPM-Kymmene slipping after results while a new share issue hit Commerzbank. Oil prices seesawed as traders weighed security scares in the Middle East and support from a weak dollar against expectations that U.S. crude stockpiles have reached record highs. Iranian forces boarded a Marshall Islands-flagged cargo ship in the Gulf on Tuesday, the Pentagon said, an event which spurred a brief rally in oil prices. “Tensions are so high in that region with the impending Iran-U.S. nuclear deal that any event implied to be U.S.-linked has an immediate effect on oil prices,” said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital. Brent crude fell 19 cents in U.S. trading to settle at $64.64 a barrel. U.S. crude settled up 7 cents at $57.06 per barrel. The start of the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting injected some caution into markets. Analysts expect soft U.S. data will nudge the U.S. central bank toward a dovish monetary policy. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, fell to an eight-week low of 96.011 after an unexpectedly weak U.S. consumer confidence report for April. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 72.17 points, or 0.4 percent, at 18,110.14. The S&P; 500 closed up 5.84 points, or 0.28 percent, at 2,114.76. The Nasdaq Composite closed down 4.82 points, or 0.1 percent, at 5,055.42. MSCI’s all-country world stock index, which tracks shares in 45 nations, was last up 0.44 points or 0.1 percent, to 442.61. Europe’s broad FTSEurofirst 300 index closed down 1.49 percent at 1,618.26. U.S. Treasury yields rose as investors reduced bond holdings to make room for government and corporate supply. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes were last down 19/32 in price to yield 1.99 percent, from a yield of 1.92 percent late Monday. U.S. gold futures for June delivery settled up $10.70 an ounce at $1,213.90.

Adding to volatility just before the close, shares of Twitter dropped as much as 24 percent after its results were published early. The stock closed down 18.2 percent at $42.27. IBM shares rose 1.9 percent to $173.92, giving the Dow its biggest boost. The company hiked its quarterly dividend by 18 percent, the biggest increase in five years.  Shares also closed above their 200-day moving average, a bullish technical signal. Apple swung between gains and losses a day after reporting results. The stock hit a record high in early trading but shares ended down 1.6 percent at $130.56, weighing on the Nasdaq. “There continues to be the bull-bear push, even with the good numbers you saw from Merck,” and other companies, said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. “Apple’s numbers were phenomenal, but yet the stock is down,” he added. “I think people were expecting a blowout quarter ... so it’s kind of a sell-the-news situation.” The Dow Jones industrial average rose 72.17 points, or 0.4 percent, to 18,110.14, the S&P; 500 gained 5.84 points, or 0.28 percent, to 2,114.76 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 4.82 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,055.42. Merck jumped 5 percent, its biggest percentage increase since January 2014, after reporting better-than-expected results and releasing favorable data late Monday about the safety of its Januvia diabetes drug. Whirlpool fell 7.1 percent to $183.70, the biggest percentage decliner in the S&P; 500, after the company cut its 2015 profit and sales forecast, blaming the strong dollar and Brazil’s stagnating economy. U.S. first-quarter earnings are now on track to post a slight gain after the mostly stronger-than-expected results, defying forecasts for the first profit decline since 2009, Thomson Reuters data showed. Contributing to day’s volatility, Iranian Revolutionary Guards forces boarded a Marshall Islands-flagged cargo ship in the Gulf, U.S. officials said. That spurred a brief rally in oil prices. Investors await the outcome of a two-day Federal Reserve meeting that ends on Wednesday, hoping for clues on when the central bank will hike interest rates. Helping the market early in the session, U.S. single-family home prices rose more than expected in February from a year earlier, according to a survey.

113,IBM,"Buffett defends core holdings like IBM, Coca-Cola, in interview","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett defended some of his core holdings in a televised interview on Monday, but reiterated that equities in general would look expensive in an environment with normal interest rates. The remarks from Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), come as several of his core holdings, including International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) and Coca-Cola (KO.N), have showed declining revenue trends in recent years. Buffett told CNBC that Berkshire had bought more shares of IBM during the first quarter, and forecast higher earnings at the company over the next 10 years. He also praised IBM’s stock buyback program, which he said had been “enormously beneficial” for shareholders, though he stressed that in general, buyback programs should be done based on share price and not as an all-purpose strategy. Coca-Cola continues to have a “strong competitive position,” he said. Referring to the broader market, Buffett said equity valuation would appear “on the high side” if interest rates were normalized from their currently low levels, while U.S. bonds currently appear “very overvalued.”  The comments on equity valuation repeated remarks he had made over the weekend at an annual Berkshire Hathaway meeting.  While he acknowledged that investors expect interest rates to rise this year, Buffett said it would be difficult for the United States to raise rates “significantly” if European rates remain low.  U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen’s “hands are somewhat tied” by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi with respect to interest rates, he said. Buffett also commented on the recent strength in the U.S. dollar, as well as the state of the euro zone, two key issues for Wall Street investors.  He predicted that the European Union “more likely than not” would exist in 20 years, though it could have different members than it currently does, a possible reference to Greece’s current difficulties. Speaking about the dollar, Buffett said that given a choice between the U.S. dollar and a basket of other currencies, he would prefer the dollar over the next 10 years.  Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft (MSFT.O) and a Berkshire director, told CNBC he would prefer the Chinese yuan over the same period of time.

The changes were disclosed in a regulatory filing detailing Berkshire’s U.S.-listed stock portfolio as of March 31. Berkshire also boosted its share stake in U.S. Bancorp, another large holding, while other portfolio managers adjusted their stakes in several companies. No new stocks were added to the portfolio, which shrank to $107.1 billion from $109.4 billion in December. Berkshire bought $1.62 billion and sold $1.11 billion of equities overall. Buffett has long praised his “Big Four” stock holdings Wells Fargo, IBM, Coca-Cola Co and American Express Co, which comprise roughly 58 percent of Berkshire’s equity investments. Buffett has stuck with them despite recent adversity including IBM’s stagnant stock price, concern over Coca-Cola’s sugary products and executive pay structure, and a February court ruling that American Express violated antitrust law. “Too many fund managers are more interested in seeing stocks to which they have committed perform well” in the short term, said Andy Kern, a University of Missouri professor who teaches a class on Buffett’s investment strategies. “Berkshire has such a long time horizon that it can afford to watch the stock price go down so it can buy more.” Friday’s regulatory filing does not disclose who makes which investment at Berkshire.

121,IBM,"Lenovo annual profit up 1 percent, missing forecasts, amid China smartphone competition","BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Lenovo Group Ltd (0992.HK), the world’s biggest PC maker by sales, said on Thursday its annual net profit rose 1 percent to $829 million, slightly below analyst expectations, as intense competition in the Chinese smartphone market eroded margins. Analysts had forecast a net profit of $857 million.  Revenue during the 2014/15 financial year rose 20 percent to $46.3 billion as Lenovo expanded its share of the shrinking PC market to one-fifth. In the fourth-quarter alone, revenue rose 21 percent to $11.3 billion. Lenovo said PC sales, by far the group’s largest business,  rose across all geographic regions but targeted Europe in particular as an area of potential growth. PC sales to businesses rose 3 percent year-on-year despite a 3 percent drop in the broader market, it added. Speaking to reporters in Hong Kong on Thursday, Yang acknowledged Lenovo’s smartphone business was flagging on its home turf, a slowing market characterized by intense competition and razor-thin margins. Industry analyst group IDC said last week smartphone shipments in the world’s most populous country shrank for the first time in six years as the market became saturated. Yang said the company needed to improve profitability in China after the smartphone division’s performance crimped Lenovo’s overall operating margin in China. “We have encountered bigger challenges in China during the past few years,” Yang said. “Our advantage was at the carriers sales channels in the past, but now we need to rebuild our retail and online sales channels.” Lenovo, whose phones are selling well in markets outside China, recently launched a sub-brand called ShenQi that is sold only online in a bid to attract young, price- and fashion-conscious buyers and ward off Internet-based rivals like Xiaomi Inc XTC.UL. Lenovo has been expanding into enterprise computing and smartphones to offset the decline in PC sales globally. The Beijing-based firm closed in October its $2.1 billion acquisition of IBM’s low-end server unit and also its $2.9 billion purchase of Motorola. The company said both the IBM unit and Motorola were “on track to deliver their targets”, with Motorola, which re-entered the Chinese market in January, set to turn profitable within 4 to 6 months. The American handset maker accounted for 7.8 million out of Lenovo’s total 18.7 million mobile units sold during the quarter. Yang also downplayed reports that the U.S. Navy would replace its IBM low-end servers out of cybersecurity concerns following the unit’s transfer to a Chinese owner.

122,IBM,"UPDATE 2-Lenovo annual profit up 1 pct, missing forecasts, amid China smartphone competition","* FY 2014/15 net profit $829 mln * Motorola, IBM purchases weigh on profit * FY revenue up 20 pct to $4.6 bln   (Adds details and CEO comments) BEIJING/HONG KONG, May 21 (Reuters) - Lenovo Group Ltd , the world’s biggest PC maker by sales, said on Thursday its annual net profit rose 1 percent to $829 million, slightly below analyst expectations, as intense competition in the Chinese smartphone market eroded margins. Analysts had forecast a net profit of $857 million. Revenue during the 2014/15 financial year rose 20 percent to $46.3 billion as Lenovo expanded its share of the shrinking PC market to one-fifth. In the fourth-quarter alone, revenue rose 21 percent to $11.3 billion. Lenovo said PC sales, by far the group’s largest business,  rose across all geographic regions but targeted Europe in particular as an area of potential growth. PC sales to businesses rose 3 percent year-on-year despite a 3 percent drop in the broader market, it added. Speaking to reporters in Hong Kong on Thursday, Yang acknowledged Lenovo’s smartphone business was flagging on its home turf, a slowing market characterised by intense competition and razor-thin margins. Industry analyst group IDC said last week smartphone shipments in the world’s most populous country shrank for the first time in six years as the market became saturated. Yang said the company needed to improve profitability in China after the smartphone division’s performance crimped Lenovo’s overall operating margin in China. “We have encountered bigger challenges in China during the past few years,” Yang said. “Our advantage was at the carriers sales channels in the past, but now we need to rebuild our retail and online sales channels.” Lenovo, whose phones are selling well in markets outside China, recently launched a sub-brand called ShenQi that is sold only online in a bid to attract young, price- and fashion-conscious buyers and ward off Internet-based rivals like Xiaomi Inc. Lenovo has been expanding into enterprise computing and smartphones to offset the decline in PC sales globally. The Beijing-based firm closed in October its $2.1 billion acquisition of IBM’s low-end server unit and also its $2.9 billion purchase of Motorola. The company said both the IBM unit and Motorola were “on track to deliver their targets”, with Motorola, which re-entered the Chinese market in January, set to turn profitable within 4 to 6 months. The American handset maker accounted for 7.8 million out of Lenovo’s total 18.7 million mobile units sold during the quarter. Yang also downplayed reports that the U.S. Navy would replace its IBM low-end servers out of cybersecurity concerns following the unit’s transfer to a Chinese owner. He said the matter could be resolved and would not affect Lenovo’s business. “Lenovo is trusted and respected worldwide and our PC business has also expanded globally including in the U.S. government and army. We haven’t heard such complaints...We are willing to communicate with the U.S. government to solve problems.” After beating earnings expectations in consecutive quarters, Lenovo shares have risen nearly 50 percent to HK $13.6 in the past 12 months, outpacing the 23 percent gain in the broader market.

127,IBM,US STOCKS-Wall St opens lower as Greek crisis weighs,"* Greece talks suffer setback after IMF quits * May producer prices record biggest gain in more than 2-1/2 years * Apple weighs on Nasdaq; IBM on Dow * Twitter rises after CEO quits * Indexes down: Dow 0.7 pct, S&P; 0.6 pct, Nasdaq 0.5 pct   (Updates to open) By Tanya Agrawal June 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks opened weaker on Friday, pressured by a setback in Greek debt talks and increased chances of a rate hike in September as a recovery in the U.S. economy gathers steam. Greece said it would not cross its “red lines” as it looked to intensify political negotiations for an agreement, saying IMF’s move to quit bailout talks was aimed at putting pressure on Athens. Investors were also edgy ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee meeting next week, the central bank’s last meeting before September, which may provide clues regarding the timing of an interest rate hike. An increase in rates raises will tighten the flow of easy money that has driven stocks and bond prices to record highs and raise borrowing costs for companies. Economists and top Wall Street banks expect the Fed to raise rates in September, in what could be the central bank’s first hike in almost a decade. “Investors don’t want to make any big moves ahead of the meeting and Greece certainly continues to be a big factor,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York. U.S. stocks climbed on Thursday as retail sales data lifted the outlook for consumer spending and as healthcare shares gained. At 9:50 a.m. ET (1350 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  was down 117.28 points, or 0.65 percent, at 17,922.09, the S&P; 500 was down 11.7 points, or 0.55 percent, at 2,097.16 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 25.74 points, or 0.51 percent, at 5,056.77. Exxon Mobil’s 1 percent fall weighed the most on the S&P; 500, while Apple’s 0.3 percent decline was the biggest drag on Nasdaq. The Dow was weighed down by IBM’s  0.9 decline. All the 10 major S&P; 500 sectors were lower, with the energy index leading the declines. U.S. producer prices in May recorded their biggest increase in more than 2-1/2 years as the cost of gasoline and food rose, suggesting that an oil-driven downward drift in prices was nearing an end. The stabilization in producer prices should support views that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year.  While the labor market had tightened, there had been few clear signs that inflation was poised to rise back toward the Fed’s 2 percent target. U.S. consumer sentiment rose more than expected in June, with the index on consumer sentiment coming in at 94.6, above the forecast of 91.5 among economists polled by Reuters. Twitter Inc’s shares were up 2.2 percent at $36.63, a day after Chief Executive Officer Dick Costolo abruptly announced he was stepping down. T-Mobile rose 2.4 percent to $39.03 after sources said Dish Network was in talks to hire banks that would provide between $10 billion and $15 billion in debt to finance the cash portion of its bid for the company. Dish was down 1.3 percent at $71.87. Leapfrog Enterprises slumped 18.4 percent to $1.69 after the toymaker posted a wider quarterly loss. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 2,012 to 670. On the Nasdaq, 1,538 issues fell and 749 rose. One stock on the S&P; 500 index hit a 52-week high and five a 52-week low.

128,IBM,Alibaba-affiliated Internet bank to rely on non-US tech,"BEIJING, June 12 (Reuters) - The Internet bank affiliate of China’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd on Friday touted its in-house cloud computing system as an alternative to the U.S. technology that the government wants to purge from the domestic financial sector. The new technology systems of soon-to-launch MYbank would avoid products from IBM Corp, Oracle Corp and EMC Corp, according to a presentation by Tang Jiacai, the bank’s chief information officer. The detail is an example of how Alibaba and its affiliate Ant Financial Services Group, which part-owns MYbank, often march in lockstep with government policy. Beijing has become increasingly wary of foreign technology and has actively promoted the weaning of the financial sector off of IBM, Oracle and EMC systems, which form the network backbone for much of China’s finance sector. The process has been dubbed “IOE out”, or “de-IOE”, after the first letters of the three companies’ names. “The innovative technology (discussed) today promotes the development of all Internet finance,” said Deputy Governor of MYbank Zhao Weixing, noting this kind of “de-IOE” cloud banking system was a first. MYbank executives said being cloud-based would reduce the bank’s technology costs and allow it to make cheaper loans. Forrester senior analyst Charlie Dai said MYbank’s deployment of non-IOE technology would be a meaningful gesture, particularly after China’s banking regulator recently nixed cyber security rules after domestic banks were unwilling to migrate off of foreign technology products. “It’s a big step if they can prove it’s viable to drop IOE from core banking functions, not just non-mission critical operations,” Dai said. MYbank is widely expected to launch this month, although executives declined to specify when. The “IOE out” characteristic was just one of many features Tang highlighted in a presentation, in which he discussed the benefits of having an in-house, cloud computing network. The government has pushed for domestic industries, especially in key sectors such as finance, to drop foreign-made technology, particularly from the United States. This came after former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden disclosed that U.S. spy agencies planted code in American tech exports to snoop on overseas targets. Analysts have said China’s efforts to protect itself and sensitive information from potential vulnerabilities in foreign-made technology are perfectly reasonable. But using different, newer technology carries its own risks, as they have neither the technical nor security pedigree of products from the likes of IBM, Oracle and EMC. Forrester’s Dai said traditional banks may be more reluctant to follow MYbank’s lead. Many Chinese technology companies said they have years to go before catching up with their U.S. peers, especially in terms of data security.

129,IBM,Fitch Affirms IBM's IDRs at 'A+/F1'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 24 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings for  International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), including the long-term  Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch's  action affects approximately $49 billion of debt, including IBM's undrawn $10  billion credit facility. A full list if rating actions follows at the end of  this press release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings and Outlook reflect Fitch's expectations for stabilizing operating  trends, including the resumption of positive organic revenue growth in the  intermediate term. IBM's investments in strategic imperatives (data, cloud and  engagement) should drive double-digit growth and achieve sufficient scale in  these markets and begin to offset long-term secular decline in legacy  information technology (IT) demand. Nonetheless, Fitch expects mid-single-digit  negative revenue growth in 2015, largely due to significant currency headwinds. Fitch expects modest margin expansion following the divestitures of the less  profitable semiconductor foundry and industry standard server (ISS) businesses  in 2014. Fitch forecasts operating EBITDA margin will approach 27 % through the  intermediate term, versus a Fitch estimated 26% for the latest 12 months (LTM)  ended March 31, 2015. At the same time, a higher mix of sales from strategic  imperatives should drive more stable profitability.  Fitch expects strong annual free cash flow (FCF) ranging from $8 billion to $9  billion through the intermediate term, driven by profitability growth and lower  capital spending following the divestiture of the more capital intensive foundry  business. Fitch expects IBM will meet its commitment of using 75%-85% of  pre-dividend annual FCF for a combination of dividends and share repurchases.  Nonetheless, Fitch expects credit protection measures will remain solid for the  rating. Total leverage (total debt to operating EBITDA) as of the LTM ended  March 31, 2015 was flat year-over-year at 1.7x and interest coverage (operating  EBITDA to gross interest expense) decreased slightly to 23.4x for the LTM ended  March 31, 2015 from 24.4x in the comparable prior year period. Core leverage  (which excludes debt related to the financing business) decreased to 1x for the  LTM ended March 31, 2015 from 1.2x in the prior year period. The ratings and Outlook reflect IBM's: --Highly diversified customer base from both an industry and geographic  perspective.  --Considerable recurring revenue from IBM's information technology (IT)  services, software and financing, which in aggregate account for approximately  half of total revenue and reduces revenue and profit volatility. --Strong market position: Breadth and quality of product and service offerings,  resulting in leading revenue market share in IT services, middleware software,  servers and No.3 share of the total disk storage market. --Significant liquidity, supported by a solid cash position, committed credit  facilities and strong FCF. --Strong core (non-financing) credit protection metrics for the 'A+' rating  category. Fitch's concerns include: --Consistent, material increases in cash dividends long-term, which, in the  absence of commensurate growth in profitability, could pressure FCF and  financial flexibility, necessitating further increases in core debt to fund  acquisitions or share repurchases. --Significant and consistent research and development (R&D;) investments required  to keep pace with innovation, which constrains meaningful profit margin  expansion but also supports barriers to entry in certain markets.  --Expectations for debt financed acquisitions in new IT to accelerate  transformation.  --Long-term threat to highly profitable mainframe demand and associated  operating system software (z/OS) from increasing penetration of  industry-standard servers (ISS). KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Roughly flat revenue growth on an organic and constant currency basis for  2015, driven by growth in IBM's strategic imperatives beginning to offset  ongoing secular declines in legacy markets. Stronger than anticipated hardware  should partially offset weaker than expected growth in services. --Beyond the near term, Fitch expects flat- to low-single-digit revenue growth  on an organic and constant currency basis, driven by faster growth in strategic  imperatives markets. --Profitability will expand due to a richer sales mix following recent  divestitures. Fitch anticipates operating EBITDA margins in the 26%-28% range  through the forecast period. --R&D; and capital spending levels remain consistent through the forecast period,  pro forma for the divestiture of the highly capital-intensive foundry business. --Annual cash pension contributions will remain in the $500 million to $600  million range. --Dividends will grow at 10% annually and IBM will use 75%-85% of pre-dividend  annual FCF for a combination of dividends and share repurchases. --Acquisitions will be debt financed but core debt levels otherwise will remain  flat.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The ratings could be downgraded if Fitch expects: --A shift to more aggressive financial policies, including sustained core  leverage in excess of 1.25x;  --Continued mid-single-digit organic negative revenue growth (constant currency  basis) or profitability pressures within IBM's traditional recurring core  franchises, signalling a weakening operating profile despite the company's  strategic imperatives growth focus.  Fitch believes the company's lack of a strategic rationale to maintain a higher  rating at the expense of financial flexibility required for acquisitions or  shareholder-friendly activities limits further positive rating actions.  LIQUIDITY Fitch believes IBM's liquidity will remain strong and, as of March 31, 2015, was  supported by: --$8.8 billion of cash and equivalents;  --An undrawn $10 billion RCF expiring Nov. 10, 2019, which fully supports IBM's  commercial paper programs;  --$8 billion to $9 billion of annual FCF also supports liquidity.  The funded status of IBM's worldwide defined benefit (DB) pension plans was 97%  at year-end 2014. Excluding unfunded nonqualified DB pension plans, the funded  status of IBM's U.S. and worldwide plans at year-end 2014 were 102% and 90%,  respectively. IBM estimates cash contribution to the defined contribution plans  to be approximately $1.2 billion during fiscal 2015. The company is not legally  required to make any contribution to the U.S. DB pension plans, but estimates  contribution to its non-U.S. defined benefit and multi-employer plans to be  approximately $600 million. Total debt was $38.8 billion as of March 31, 2015, consisting of $4.5 billion of  short-term debt and $34.3 billion of long-term debt. Fitch estimates $26.2  billion (68%) of total debt is attributable to IBM's global financing business  with the remaining debt attributable to core (non-financing) operations. IBM has  long-term debt maturities of approximately $650 million for the remainder of  2015. The main purpose of IBM Global Financing (IGF) is to facilitate clients'  acquisition of IBM systems, software and services by providing financial and  capital management solutions. IGF has a solid long-term operating record,  provides strategic advantages to IBM in terms of attracting and retaining  customers by delivering total solutions. IBM also generates an annuity-like  revenue stream associated with multi-year leases. IGF's primary focus on IBM's products and clients mitigates some risks  associated with financing via a deep knowledge of its client base and clear  insight into the solutions being financed. Asset quality metrics have remained  relatively solid as a result of the relatively conservative underwriting culture  and strong risk management capabilities. IGF's capitalization remains solid for  the rating category and leverage levels continue to hover near management's  target of 7x. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed IBM's ratings as follows: --IDR at 'A+'; --Senior unsecured revolving credit facility at 'A+'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper rating at 'F1'.

131,IBM,IBM revenue falls for 13th straight quarter; shares dip,"(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp’s (IBM.N) revenue fell for the 13th consecutive quarter and missed the average analyst estimate, as it continued to shed low-margin businesses and the strong dollar weighed on Big Blue’s results. Shares of the world’s largest technology services company  fell about 5 percent in after-market trading on Monday. IBM is deep in transition, and has been selling businesses such as low-end servers, cash registers, and semiconductors to focus on high-growth areas like security software, cloud services and data analytics. The company, which sold its x86 server business to Lenovo Group Ltd (0992.HK) last year, has continued realigning its operations by paying contract-chipmaker Globalfoundries Inc to take over its loss-making semiconductor unit this month. Revenue from what the company calls “strategic imperatives”, which include cloud and mobile computing, data analytics, social and security software, rose about 20 percent, yet the new businesses have so far failed to make up for revenue lost to divestitures. IBM said it expected third-quarter revenue to be the same as revenue from the first quarter, or about $19.6 billion.  Revenue from its software business fell 10 percent to $5.8 billion from a year earlier. Revenue from global technology services such as outsourcing fell 10 percent, hurt by weak discretionary IT spending by clients. “Traditional software and services remain under pressure across IT, and we believe M&A; remains one of the only glimmers of hope to restore growth back to these traditional tech giants that are starving for growth,” Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, said. Armonk, New York-based IBM’s total revenue fell to $20.81 billion in the second quarter ended June 30, from $24.05 billion a year earlier, missing the average analyst estimate of $20.95 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. IBM’s quarterly results were also hurt by the strong dollar. The company, which gets more than half its revenue from overseas, said it expected a slightly greater currency impact in the second half of the year. Consolidated net income dropped to $3.45 billion, or $3.50 per share, for the second quarter, from $4.14 billion, $4.12 per share, a year earlier.

Shares of technology companies were among the bright spots, helping the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to its third straight record close as investor focus shifts to earnings from Greece and China. The top five boosts to the S&P; 500 were from the tech sector. Gold prices plunged to their lowest in more than five years while copper prices hit their lowest in nearly two weeks.  Oil prices fell on signs of a growing glut in refined products to pull the S&P; energy index down 1.3 percent. The dollar index rose 0.17 percent to $98.04. It had earlier hit a three-month high due to expectations of a Federal Reserve rate hike this year. “You’ve got an interesting dynamic in the S&P; 500, so you put Greece in the rear-view mirror and then have the first week of earnings end with a better-than-expected style, and that brings you back up to the top end of the range, or at least close to it,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. “But when you have commodity pressure, if you have energy down a full percentage point on the S&P; today - that is going to be a tough hurdle to get over.” IBM lost 3.6 percent to $167.01 in extended trade after its quarterly results on Monday. Apple, Yahoo  and Microsoft are due later this week. So far, 70 percent of companies have reported earnings above analyst expectations, above the 63 percent average beat rate since 1994. Earnings are expected to decline 2.1 percent for the quarter, a modest improvement from the expected 3 percent fall on July 1. However, 55 percent have topped revenue forecasts, below the 61 percent average beat rate since 2002. U.S. companies were expected to post their worst sales decline in nearly six years in the second quarter, in part due to the strong dollar that reduces the value of U.S. companies’ overseas income. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 13.96 points, or 0.08 percent, to 18,100.41, the S&P; 500 gained 1.64 points, or 0.08 percent, to 2,128.28 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 8.72 points, or 0.17 percent, to 5,218.86. The S&P; 500 is less than 3 points from its record close of 2,130.82 on May 21. Morgan Stanley touched its highest level in seven years after the bank’s profit beat expectations. However, it relinquished gains and closed down 0.4 percent at $40.01. NYSE declining issues outnumbered advancers 2,086 to 967, for a 2.16-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,935 issues fell and 893 advanced for a 2.17-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.

135,IBM,Options traders grow more bullish on big tech names,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Trading in a key technology fund’s options showed signs of growing bullishness on Monday ahead of earnings reports this week from big names in the sector, including Apple Inc (AAPL.O), International Business Machines (IBM.N) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O). Shares of the Technology Select Sector SPDR exchange traded fund (XLK.P) were up 29 cents at $43.73 on Monday, just shy of the all-time high of $43.81 set on May 27. While recent trading in the ETF’s options has been mixed, the options found favor with bulls on Friday. A trader appears to have bought 40,500 calls in an apparent bet on the ETF’s shares rising above $45 by mid-September. The trade opens the biggest block of open interest in the ETF’s options. Sentiment for the sector seems to have been boosted from Google Inc’s (GOOGL.O) strong quarterly results on Thursday, which propelled its shares to an all-time high, strategists said. The effect was most noticeable for options on Apple, scheduled to report third-quarter revenue and profit results on Tuesday. Since Google’s results, there has been a significant pick-up in demand for Apple calls, usually used to place bullish bets on the shares. “It just seems that as if Google ripped and traders came in pretty aggressively to set up on the long side in Apple,” said Jim Strugger, a derivatives strategist at MKM Partners. By Monday afternoon, Apple’s options volume was at 1.2 million contracts compared with an average daily volume of 820,000 contracts, according to Trade Alert. Calls betting on Apple shares rising above $140 and $135 by Friday, were the busiest, with combined options volume of more than 100,000 contracts. Microsoft and IBM also attracted brisk activity in the options market. Options on IBM, expected to post quarterly results after the close of trading on Monday, were especially busy with trading volume at 108,000 contracts, or five times normal levels, according to Trade Alert data.

Shortly after trading began, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite added to its gains from last week and touched a record for the third straight day as investors shift their focus to earnings from concerns surrounding Greece and China. Gold prices plunged as much as 4 percent to their lowest in more than five years while copper prices hit their lowest in nearly two weeks. Oil prices fell too on signs of a growing glut in refined products. The dollar index was up marginally at $97.87. It had earlier hit a three-month high due to expectations of a Federal Reserve rate hike this year. “The commodity markets are lower which are a concern because if those prices fall then economic growth isn’t as strong as we thought,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. On Friday, strong earnings from Google pushed the tech-heavy Nasdaq to a record close, which gained 4.3 percent for the week, its largest weekly gain since October while the S&P; 500 stopped just short of its record high. Tech earnings will continue to be in focus this week with IBM reporting after the close on Monday and other big tech giants such as Apple, Yahoo and Microsoft  expected to report later this week. Of the companies that have reported earnings so far, 71 percent have reported earnings above analyst expectations, above the 63 percent that typically beat in a quarter. However, only 51 percent have beaten on revenue, below the 61 percent. U.S. companies were expected to post their worst sales decline in nearly six years in the second quarter, in part due to the strong dollar that reduces the value of U.S. companies’ overseas income. Profit is expected to have fallen 2.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters estimates. “Revenue growth is very weak and unless you see some sustainable growth, we’ll continue to see sideways movement for the rest of the year,” said Nolte.

The Dow fell 1 percent, with IBM and United Tech  contributing around 118 points to the 181-point drop. The decline marked the biggest percentage decline in about two weeks for the blue-chip index. IBM’s shares fell 5.9 percent to $163.07, a day after the company’s revenue dropped for the 13th consecutive quarter and fell short of analyst expectations. Fellow Dow component United Technologies tumbled 7 percent to $102.71 and was the worst performer on the Dow after cutting its full-year profit outlook for the third time this year. “For the first time in a while, fundamentals seem to be driving the action today in an otherwise very quiet macro backdrop and probably will continue to do so for the next couple of weeks as we work through the heart of earnings season,” said Ryan Larson, head of U.S. equity trading at RBC Global Asset Management in Chicago. A trio of tech companies pushed stock futures lower after the closing bell, as Apple tumbled 6.2 percent to $122.65, Microsoft lost 3.5 percent to $45.65, and Yahoo  shed 2.2 percent to $38.85 after their quarterly results. Strong earnings from technology companies earlier this earnings season helped drive gains on the Nasdaq, which has outperformed both the Dow and S&P; 500 in July. While markets are near record highs, June-quarter earnings of S&P; 500 companies are expected to dip 1.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. That marks an improvement from the expected decline of 3 percent on July 1, but well below the 5.9 percent gain forecast on Jan. 1. So far, 70 percent have reported earnings above analyst expectations, above the 63 percent average beat rate since 1994. However, 53 percent have topped revenue forecasts, below the 61 percent average beat rate since 2002. U.S. companies are expected to post their worst sales decline in nearly six years in the second quarter, in part due to the strong dollar that reduces the value of U.S. companies’ overseas income. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 181.12 points, or 1 percent, to 17,919.29, the S&P; 500 lost 9.07 points, or 0.43 percent, to 2,119.21 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 10.74 points, or 0.21 percent, to 5,208.12.

S&P; 500 mini futures were down about 0.4 percent from late U.S. levels, after U.S. equities tumbled on weak earnings from bellwethers IBM and United Technologies, while Apple Inc slumped in late trading after posting its results. Financial spreadbetters expected Britain’s FTSE 100  to open 24 points or 0.4 percent lower; Germany’s DAX  to open 40 points or 0.3 percent lower; and France’s CAC 40  to open 11 to 13 points or as much as 0.3 percent lower on Wednesday. “As goes Apple, as goes the U.S. stock market. So, unless we see something spectacular from European markets, we should see a modestly risk-off session in the U.S.,” Chris Weston, chief market strategist at IG, said in a note. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan  extended losses and was down about 1.1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei stock index ended down 1.2 percent, snapping its six-day rising streak and pulling away from Tuesday’s nearly four-week closing high as the Apple news reverberated on related tech shares. “Since the market had been rising, such bad news can take a toll,” said Hikaru Sato, a senior technical analyst at Daiwa Securities. “But the impact from Apple’s weak forecast should not drag on.” Spot gold shed about 0.7 percent on the day to $1,090.95 per ounce, after plunging to five-year lows on Monday as investors unloaded bullion against a backdrop of improving risk sentiment after Greece agreed on a plan with its creditors that will keep it in the euro zone for now. Standard & Poor’s on Tuesday upgraded Greece’s sovereign credit rating by two notches and revised its outlook to stable from negative, citing euro zone countries’ initial agreement to start negotiations with Athens on a third bailout. The euro edged down slightly on the day at $1.0935, toward Monday’s three-month low of $1.0808. The dollar index was steady at 97.331 after rising as high as 98.151 in the previous session, its highest level since late April.

152,IBM,"U.S. court rejects appeal of apartheid lawsuits against Ford, IBM","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Victims of apartheid in South Africa cannot pursue lawsuits seeking to hold Ford Motor Co and IBM Corp liable for conducting business that helped perpetuate the practice decades ago, a U.S. appeals court ruled on Monday. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said black South Africans did not show that Ford and International Business Machines Corp engaged in enough wrongdoing in the United States from the 1970s to early 1990s to justify lawsuits over their alleged roles in killings, torture and other human rights abuses. Ford was accused of providing military vehicles for South African security forces and sharing information about anti-apartheid and union activists. IBM was accused of providing technology and training to perpetuate racial separation and the “denationalization” of black South Africans. The plaintiffs sued 13 years ago under the Alien Tort Statute, a 1789 law that lets non-U.S. citizens seek damages in U.S. courts for human rights abuses abroad. But the U.S. Supreme Court significantly narrowed the reach of that law in April 2013, leading a reluctant U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin in August 2014 to dismiss the plaintiffs’ case. Upholding that dismissal, Circuit Judge José Cabranes wrote for a 3-0 appeals court panel that Ford could not be held directly responsible for alleged improper actions by its South African unit. He also found no showing that “by developing hardware and software to collect innocuous population data,” IBM purposefully contributed to apartheid-era abuses. “Knowledge of or complicity in the perpetration of a crime under the law of nations (customary international law) - absent evidence that a defendant purposefully facilitated the commission of that crime - is insufficient to establish a claim of aiding and abetting liability under the ATS,” Cabranes wrote. Diane Sammons, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said Ford’s U.S. conduct justified liability and called it “astounding” that IBM’s conduct was not deemed purposeful. “We certainly will consider an appeal to the Supreme Court,” she said. In a statement, Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford said it remains committed to expanding in South Africa, after 91 years of manufacturing there. IBM, based in Armonk, New York, did not respond to requests for comment. Dozens of companies were previously dismissed from the litigation, including most recently Germany’s Daimler AG  and Rheinmetall AG in December 2013.

156,IBM,"Anaplan targets SAP, Oracle in fast-growing business planning market","FRANKFURT, July 28 (Reuters) - Business planning software start-up Anaplan is nipping at the heels of industry leaders SAP , Oracle and IBM, with sales of its cloud-based service tripling in each of the past three years as it seeks to shake up the market. Customers are demanding more flexible ways to use business planning software, which crunches corporate data to allow companies to forecast growth and set performance goals. While major players like SAP, Oracle’s Hyperion business and IBM’s Cognos and Applix units have been forced to offer cloud-based products, their focus has remained on packaged software as it makes up the bulk of their revenue. This has opened the door to nimbler rivals focused solely on cloud-based software in the fast-growing market. “There is a major shift going on and Anaplan is at the forefront,” Forrester business apps analyst Paul Hamerman said. “It appears to be the fastest-growing vendor in this space and the one which already has good traction with large companies.” Anaplan is backed by cloud market leaders Salesforce  and Workday, both as investors and by integrating their sales and marketing and human resource products. The company, which was founded in a north England farmhouse in 2006, is considering a stock-market listing in the coming year, although it said its rapid growth in customers and revenue gave it room to be patient. “We are really going after ‘global 2,000’ companies,” Laurent Lefouet, Anaplan’s managing director for Europe, Middle East and Africa said in an interview. As of January, it had signed up users at 300 companies, two-thirds of them global firms, he added. Lefouet said Anaplan was on track to sign up 150,000 users this year, and should triple that number in 2016, putting it in reach of 1 million users by 2017 or 2018, he said. By contrast, SAP and Oracle count tens of million of cloud software users, although these numbers include a far broader set of products. While Anaplan, now based in San Francisco, could consider an initial public offering (IPO) in the coming year, it is focused on its next milestone of signing up 1 million users, or an average of 1,000 users across 1,000 global accounts, Lefouet said. However, business software analyst Hamerman said it was more likely that small cloud players would be bought up by bigger rivals than go public. Traditional, non cloud-based, planning software suffers from high costs and inflexible design, while customers are “locked in” by vendors as software switching costs are high, Hamerman said. But customer demands are changing rapidly, he added. Anaplan offers users a cloud-based service that processes billions of spreadsheet cells of corporate data on central computers, then illustrates the results in charts and graphics within a user’s web browser. Its closest rivals are U.S.-based Adaptive and Host Analytics. Industry experts say that what separates Anaplan from many of its competitors - both large and small - is the way it twins sophisticated data analysis and modelling with a relatively simple interface that allows its software to be used by managers across corporate departments, without lots of tech support. Hamerman said the business planning market was currently worth around $3 billion in annual sales, spread across 15 to 20 players. But Anaplan said its potential audience was 20 percent of all corporate employees, a far bigger market that it said could be worth upward of $20 billion in the long run. Business planning tools, an outgrowth of accounting systems finance teams use to manage corporate budgets, are now being used by sales and marketing teams to forecast targets, and human resources or operations to set performance goals. Anaplan said it had recently begun to see adoption of such software by thousands of users in big corporate names such as Hewlett-Packard, Intel’s McAfee unit, VMware  and consumer groups Procter & Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser and Kimberly-Clark. Anaplan and its peers decline to disclose revenue figures. But a calculation based on the 45,000 customers Anaplan says it has signed up combined with an estimated average annual subscription fee comparable to Salesforce.com’s roughly $1,000, suggests revenue is nearing $50 million (45 million euros). The Yorkshire-founded, Silicon Valley-financed and French executive-led firm has raised around $150 million to date, with its latest funding round of $100 million led by Draper Fisher Jurvetson and including Sands Capital, Brookside, Bain Capital, along with Salesforce and Workday.

157,IBM,IBM to buy Merge Healthcare in $1 billion deal,"(Reuters) - IBM Corp (IBM.N) said it would buy medical image company Merge Healthcare Inc MRGE.O in a $1 billion deal and combine it with its newly formed health analytics unit, which is powered by its famous Watson supercomputer. IBM plans to combine data and images from Merge Healthcare’s medical imaging management platform with Watson’s cloud-based healthcare computing system. The system analyzes high volumes of data, understands complex questions posed in natural language and proposes evidence-based answers. The deal will help physicians and researchers collate and analyze data such as patient’s medical and family history, data on others with similar symptoms and clinical research, trials and outcomes. “Imaging is central to effective diagnosis and treatment ... but it is increasingly important to share these images between providers to deliver high quality, cost-effective care,” Dougherty and Co analyst Brooks O’Neil wrote in a note. IBM has been expanding aggressively in the healthcare IT sector. The Merge deal is the company’s third major health-related acquisition since launching the Watson Health unit in April. “Organically, we will continue to build and invest from a research perspective in core technologies,” said Stephen Gold, vice president, IBM Watson. “We will compliment and supplement that with acquisitions,” Gold told Reuters. With this acquisition IBM will get access 7,500 U.S. healthcare sites. Merge Healthcare shareholders will get $7.13 per share at a premium of 31.8 percent to Wednesday’s close, the companies said. Merge shares were trading at $7.08 by afternoon. IBM shares were little changed at $156.33.

Adding to the positive sentiment, poor data out of China boosted hopes for additional stimulus from Beijing. Greek banks could get a first capital injection soon after a bailout deal is agreed, and before the ECB can conduct stress tests, a euro zone official told Reuters. Precision Castparts shares jumped as much as 19.3 percent to $231.25 after Berkshire Hathaway   agreed to buy the aircraft components in the biggest deal for Buffett’s Hathaway. Berkshire Class B shares fell 1.4 percent to $141.60. As the U.S. Federal Reserve has kept interest rates near zero for nearly a decade, debt has been cheap, leading to a rise in merger and acquisition activity. Up to the end of July, cross-border M&A; activity totaled $913.5 billion, up 23 percent from a year ago. July was the seventh strongest month for deal activity since 1980, according to Thomson Reuters data, showing the hunger for acquisitions as the Fed prepares to hike rate later this year. “The M&A; environment is ripe for more deals and at the end of the year you will see a lot more deals than what we saw last year,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. At 9:45 a.m. ET (1345 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  was up 169.8 points, or 0.98 percent, at 17,543.18. All the Dow components were higher. The S&P; 500 was up 19.9 points, or 0.96 percent, at 2,097.47 and the Nasdaq composite was up 56.49 points, or 1.12 percent, at 5,100.04. All the 10 major S&P; sectors were higher, led by the industrials index’s 1.3 percent. Precision Castparts gave the biggest boost to the index and the second biggest boost to the S&P; 500. In other deal news, ammonia maker CVR Partners said it would acquire Rentech Nitrogen Partners for about $533 million. Rentech soared 23.3 percent to $12.70. Mallinckrodt fell 0.6 percent to $99.73 after the drugmaker said it would buy immunotherapy company Therakos in a deal valued at about $1.33 billion. IBM rose 0.8 percent to $156.36 after Buffett’s comments on CNBC were interpreted to mean that he would be interested in buying more IBM stock. U.S. stocks ended lower on Friday, with the Dow closing down for the seventh straight day, after solid job growth data for July pried the door open a little wider for a potential rate in September. “I think the Fed is desperate to raise rates this year and I think it will happen in September. The only fly in the ointment is the inflation rate which is below what the Fed wants,” said Hogan.

166,IBM,Berkshire's Buffett says bought some IBM shares in third quarter: CNBC,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett, the billionaire chief executive officer and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, told CNBC on Tuesday that he added to his share stake in International Business Machines Corp in the third quarter.  “We bought it in the first quarter, and normally I wouldn’t tell you this, but we bought some in the third quarter,” Buffett told the cable television network.  Buffett’s Berkshire owned a more than 8 percent stake in IBM as of June 30. IBM shares, which have slumped nearly 12 percent so far in the third quarter through last Friday during broad stock market volatility, last traded up 1.9 percent at $146.42 in afternoon trading Tuesday.  Buffett also said that the U.S. economy was not growing at a “booming” rate but remained on the path it has been on for six years of growing at a rate of 2 percent or a little better annually. He said he would “be a little careful” about getting too excited about quarterly statistics. Buffett made his comments after Commerce Department data in late August showed U.S. gross domestic product expanded at a 3.7 percent annual pace in the second quarter instead of the 2.3 percent rate reported the previous month.  Buffett also said Berkshire still has ample cash after agreeing to buy Precision Castparts Corp for over $32 billion and would never hold less than $20 billion in cash. “I’ve still got money left to buy, I’ll never go below $20 billion of cash, in fact I won’t even really go very close to it,” he said.  He said Berkshire “might be a little less aggressive in the open market” given the Precision Castparts deal, but added: “I haven’t held back from doing anything because of that upcoming purchase.” Buffett, whose Berkshire owns warrants entitling it to buy 700 million Bank of America shares at $7.14 each between now and 2021, said that if he could vote on Bank of America Chief Executive Brian Moynihan’s title, he would vote to have him in both the CEO and chairman roles. Buffett also said Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders “has run a model campaign” and said the 2016 Republican presidential race reminded him of “being at an amusement park and watching all the kids in bumper cars.” “What you’re seeing is indicative of a lot of dissatisfaction in the country with Washington politicians and perhaps the media to some extent too.” ",9082015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-hatha-buffett/berkshires-buffett-says-bought-some-ibm-shares-in-third-quarter-cnbc-idUSKCN0R822R20150908

170,IBM,SEC can pursue insider trading case against brokers: judge,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two New York stockbrokers must face civil insider trading charges brought by U.S. securities regulators, a U.S. judge ruled on Friday, despite a landmark appellate ruling that torpedoed the criminal case against them. U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan rejected a bid from former Euro Pacific Capital Inc traders Daryl Payton and Benjamin Durant to throw out U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges that they engaged in illegal trading ahead of an IBM Corp (IBM.N) deal. However, Rakoff postponed the scheduled Sept. 21 trial with the parties’ consent while the U.S. Supreme Court weighs whether to review the appellate ruling, which could affect the SEC case’s outcome. Gregory Morvillo, a lawyer for Durant, and Matthew Fishbein, a lawyer for Payton, declined to comment on Rakoff’s ruling, as did a spokeswoman for the SEC. The brokers had argued that the case must be dismissed in light of a December decision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York that curtailed authorities’ ability to pursue insider trading cases. In reversing the convictions of hedge fund managers Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson, the appeals court held that prosecutors must prove a trader knew that the source of a tip received a benefit in exchange. The 2nd Circuit also narrowed the definition of “benefit,” saying it had to be more than mere friendship. The Justice Department has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the ruling; the court has not yet decided. In the current case, authorities said a lawyer representing IBM in 2009 told Trent Martin, an analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS.L), that the company planned to acquire SPSS Inc for $1.2 billion. Martin bought SPSS stock and told his roommate, Euro Pacific broker Thomas Conradt, who in turn shared the information with co-workers Durant, Payton and another man named David Weishaus, all of whom traded on the tip. All five men were criminally charged, and all but Durant pleaded guilty. But a federal judge threw out their guilty pleas following the 2nd Circuit’s ruling, and prosecutors dropped the case. The SEC, however, pressed forward against Durant and Payton, citing a different legal standard for civil charges. The defendants argued they were too far removed from the original source to meet the 2nd Circuit’s standard. But the SEC said they willfully ignored red flags, proving they knew the information was illegally obtained. The case is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v. Payton et al, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 14-4644.

175,IBM,IBM allows Chinese Government to review source code: WSJ,"(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp has agreed to let China review some product source code in a secure room, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing two people briefed on the practice. It was not clear which products IBM was allowing reviews of or how much time officials of China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology can spend looking at the code, the WSJ said on Friday.  U.S. tech companies have been facing increased pressure from Chinese authorities to accept rigorous security checks before their products may be purchased by China’s sprawling, state-run financial institutions. “IBM does not provide government access to client data or back doors into our technology,” the company said in an emailed statement to Reuters on Friday. The company said that in several countries it can conduct limited demonstrations of specific aspects of its technology in “highly secure, controlled IBM environments that have no external communication links”. IBM said such demonstrations were not unique to the company, pointing to Microsoft Corp’s program to provide governments with controlled access to Microsoft Windows source code. Microsoft signed one such Government Security Program (GSP) with China in 2003.  In April, China’s bank regulator temporarily suspended financial industry cyber security rules that would force technology vendors to Chinese banks to hand over secret source code and adopt Chinese encryption algorithms, after feedback from banks. Beijing has considered its reliance on foreign technology a national security weakness, especially after former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden’s revelations that U.S. spy agencies planted code in American-made software to snoop on overseas targets.

178,IBM,IBM says some governments allowed to review its source code,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp said on Friday it allows certain countries to review, under strict control, portions of the U.S. technology company’s product source code to detect any security flaws in its software. China is among those countries, a person familiar with the company’s policy there said. The reviews must be done using an IBM security application and the company “does not let people take the code out of the room,” the source said on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.  Without mentioning China, IBM said in a statement that “strict procedures are in place within these technology demonstration centers to ensure that no software source code is released, copied or altered in any way.” “IBM does not provide government access to client data or back doors into our technology,” the company added. The Wall Street Journal, citing two people briefed on the practice, reported earlier Friday that IBM was allowing officials from China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology to examine code. The China ministry could not immediately be reached for comment. The reviews would make IBM the first major U.S. tech company to comply with Beijing’s recent demands for a stronger hand in foreign technology there, the Journal said. The report did not make clear which products IBM was allowing reviews of or how long officials can spend looking at the code, and IBM did not address those issues.

179,IBM,UPDATE 4-IBM says some governments allowed to review its source code,"(Adds IBM statement) By Joseph Menn SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 16 (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp said on Friday it allows certain countries to review, under strict control, portions of the U.S. technology company’s product source code to detect any security flaws in its software. China is among those countries, a person familiar with the company’s policy there said. The reviews must be done using an IBM security application and the company “does not let people take the code out of the room,” the source said on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. Without mentioning China, IBM said in a statement that “strict procedures are in place within these technology demonstration centers to ensure that no software source code is released, copied or altered in any way.” “IBM does not provide government access to client data or back doors into our technology,” the company added. The Wall Street Journal, citing two people briefed on the practice, reported earlier Friday that IBM was allowing officials from China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology to examine code. The China ministry could not immediately be reached for comment. The reviews would make IBM the first major U.S. tech company to comply with Beijing’s recent demands for a stronger hand in foreign technology there, the Journal said. The report did not make clear which products IBM was allowing reviews of or how long officials can spend looking at the code, and IBM did not address those issues.

180,IBM,"IBM revenue falls more than expected, cuts profit forecast","(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) posted a bigger-than-expected drop in revenue and cut its full-year profit forecast, as a stronger U.S. dollar accentuated weakness in demand from China and emerging markets. It was the 14th quarter in a row that IBM has posted a reduction in revenue, as the world’s largest technology services company gets rid of low-margin businesses, but has so far failed to make up the shortfall with newer initiatives in the more lucrative area of cloud computing. Shares of IBM fell 4.8 percent in after-hours trading to $141.95.  “This is another example of the massive headwinds that large-cap traditional tech stalwarts are seeing in this ever-changing environment, as more customers move to the cloud,” FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said.  China was particularly hard hit, with fewer big deals causing revenue from that country to fall 17 percent, IBM’s chief financial officer said on a conference call with analysts. Sales in Brazil, Russia, India and China combined were down 30 percent. Armonk, New York-based IBM, which gets more than half its business from overseas, said overall revenue from continuing operations was cut 9 percent by a strong U.S. dollar .DXY, which is up about 17 percent from a year ago against a basket of currencies. The company’s total revenue fell 13.9 percent to $19.28 billion in the quarter, below analysts’ average forecast of $19.62 billion.  Martin Schroeter, IBM’s CFO, pointed to weakness in its consulting and storage businesses for the revenue shortfall, after taking currency moves and discontinued business into account. “I would characterize it as the consulting and systems integration business moving away from these large, packaged applications and the storage business moving to flash and to the cloud,” Schroeter told Reuters in an interview. Flash is a speedy type of memory used in mobile phones and other types of electronic devices. IBM lowered its full-year 2015 operating profit forecast to a range of $14.75 to $15.75 per share from $15.75 to $16.50. Analysts on average were expecting $15.68, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company is shifting away from hardware to the cloud, much like established rivals such as Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O). Each is striving to boost Internet-based software and services sales to compete with Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N) and Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) web software unit. In August, IBM said it would buy medical image company Merge Healthcare Inc MRGE.O in a $1-billion deal and combine it with its newly formed health analytics unit, which is powered by its famous Watson supercomputer. Revenue from what the company calls “strategic imperatives,” which include cloud and mobile computing, data analytics, social and security software, rose about 17 percent in the third quarter ended Sept 30. Yet the new businesses have so far failed to make up for revenue lost to divestitures. The company known as ‘Big Blue’ has been selling low-margin businesses such as cash registers, low-end servers and semiconductors to focus on high-growth areas such as security software and data analytics, besides cloud-based services. IBM’s net income from continuing operations fell to $2.96 billion, or $3.02 per share, from $3.46 billion, or $3.46 per share, a year earlier. Consolidated net income rose to $2.95 billion, or $3.01 per share, from $18 million, or 2 cents per share, a year earlier. Last year profit was hurt by non recurring pre-tax charge of $3.3 billion, net of tax, for discontinued operations. Excluding items, IBM earned $3.34 per share from continuing operations in the latest quarter, beating the average analyst estimate of a profit of $3.30 per share. Up to Monday’s close, IBM’s shares had fallen about 7 percent this year.

At least nine brokerages lowered their price target on IBM’s stock after the company posted a bigger-than-expected drop in third-quarter revenue and cut its full-year profit forecast. IBM shares fell as much as 5.8 percent to $140.51. The last time the stock declined more than 5 percent in a session was in July after the company’s disappointing second-quarter results. At least six of 19 analysts covering the stock have a price target that is less than the stock’s low of the day. Analysts median price target is $150, according to Thomson Reuters data. “While IBM is another quarter along in its transition and seeing good growth in several strategic areas, it is not yet sufficient enough to offset the pressures in the legacy businesses,” Wells Fargo Securities analysts noted, adding that growth could be at least a few quarter away. It was the 14th quarter in a row that IBM has posted a reduction in revenue, as it gets rid of low-margin businesses such as cash registers, low-end servers and semiconductors to focus on high-growth areas such as security software and data analytics, besides cloud-based services. IBM Chief Executive Virginia Rometty shrugged off the weak results, stressing that the company’s shift to a new business model would take time to execute. “We run the banks of the world, the airlines. I make no apologies for that – those are important businesses, and we run them well,” Rometty said at a conference hosted by the Wall Street Journal in Laguna Beach, California on Tuesday. Analysts expect that IBM will post an increase in quarterly revenue only in the third quarter of next fiscal year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “We believe that IBM faces a long transition driven by pressure in legacy business units/products that are greater than the impact of strategic imperatives. Moreover, this quarter we saw meaningful weakness in software margins,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Keith Bachman wrote in a note. Rometty declined to say when the turnaround would complete.

A 5.7-percent drop to $140.64 in IBM also weighed on the market. The stock hit a five-year intraday low at $140.28 after it reported a bigger-than-expected fall in quarterly revenue and cut its full-year profit forecast. The S&P; healthcare sector fell 1.5 percent, while the Nasdaq Biotech Index dropped 3.2 percent. Concerns about drug pricing have hit biotech and other healthcare shares. “You’re seeing weakness in momentum names in general. Obviously the healthcare names are under pressure again, especially pharma companies. That further increases the pall over that sector,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. At the same time, O’Rourke said, investors seem to be buying more stable names, such as Apple. Apple jumped 1.8 percent to $113.77. Stocks have mostly gained this month following a selloff in the third quarter, though concern about third-quarter earnings has added to caution in recent sessions. Among companies beating analysts’ expectations, United Technologies rose 3.9 percent to $95.62, giving the Dow its biggest boost. Also on the plus side, Verizon’s shares were up 1.2 percent at $45.24 after the largest U.S. wireless service provider reported better-than-expected revenue and profit. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 13.43 points, or 0.08 percent, to 17,217.11, the S&P; 500 lost 2.89 points, or 0.14 percent, to 2,030.77 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 24.50 points, or 0.5 percent, to 4,880.97. The S&P; 500 is up 5.8 percent so far in October. Earnings for S&P; 500 companies are expected to have fallen about 4 percent in the third quarter, while revenue is expected to have declined 3.8 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Of the S&P; 500 companies that have reported so far, roughly 40 percent have beaten revenue expectations, below the long-term average, according to Thomson Reuters data. Travelers rose 2.5 percent to $108.95. The insurer’s quarterly profit topped estimates, helped by higher underwriting gains. Harley Davidson skidded 13.9 percent to $48.25 after the motorcycle maker cut its full-year shipment forecast. Shares of Tesla dropped 6.6 percent to $213.03 in heavy volume. Consumer Reports magazine found that advanced fuel-saving technology and digital multimedia systems in vehicles including the Tesla Model S sedan are hurting reliability. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,888 to 1,170, for a 1.61-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,426 issues fell and 1,345 advanced for a 1.06-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.

191,IBM,"IBM says SEC investigating company's books, shares fall","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating how the International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) recognized revenue for certain deals in the United States, Britain and Ireland, IBM said on Tuesday, news that sent its shares down 4 percent. IBM, the world’s largest technology services company, said it learned of the investigation in August and was cooperating with the SEC, but did not disclose what deals were being probed. An IBM spokesman told Reuters the company had a “rigorous and disciplined process” for its reporting of revenue.  Shares of IBM fell as much as 4.4 percent to a five-year low of $137.33 and closed down 4 percent. News of the SEC probe came a week after the company posted lackluster quarterly results and cut its 2015 profit forecast. “It couldn’t come at a worse possible time because now the stock is at another 52-week low as a result of this,” said Belpointe analyst David Nelson. He said, however, that the probe “doesn’t look like a massive smoking gun.” “The investigation could be into warranty reserves, they could have recognized an item at the wrong time,” Nelson said. IBM has been a subject of several SEC probes in the past, including a 2013 investigation on how it reported revenue from its cloud computing business. Regulators ended that probe without recommending any action. (reut.rs/1MqyJ4K) Earlier this month, the SEC called financial reporting “a key enforcement priority” as it announced a series of enforcement actions for violations of federal securities laws. Revenue recognition is how a company records revenue on its books, with discrepancies often arising depending on whether cash is received, or payments deferred. Accounting rules differ in the United States and in Britain and Ireland. A May 2014 change in the accounting standard for revenue recognition has increased scrutiny by regulators. Some 60 percent of SEC actions from 1998-2007 focused on improper revenue recognition, according to a 2010 report by COSO, a committee with representatives from private-sector accounting and other professional groups that studies fraudulent financial reporting.

200,IBM,UPDATE 1-Deutsche Post shares drop after IT delays cause earnings shortfall,"* Says IT upgrade could drag on for years * In talks for alternatives or correcting current system * CFO says too early to discuss possible compensation * Shares drop 3 pct, biggest DAX decliner   (Adds details from CFO, shares) By Victoria Bryan BERLIN, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Deutsche Post said revamping IT systems at its logistics unit will drag on for several more years after its plans had to be re-examined, leading the group to warn that earnings would fall short of its previous expectations. Shares in the group, known globally for its DHL delivery brand, fell 3 percent on Thursday morning after it said late the previous day it now expected 2015 earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of at least 2.4 billion euros ($2.6 billion). That compares with a previous target of between 2.95 and 3.1 billion. The group is writing down 345 million euros related to the failed IT implementation, but it is too early to talk about asking for compensation from IT suppliers SAP and IBM , Chief Financial Officer Larry Rosen told reporters. SAP had no immediate comment, while IBM did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “We’re still in talks about correcting the system, but we are also in parallel looking at alternatives,” Rosen said, declining to give a timeframe for any decision on whether to stick with current suppliers or go for another option. Rosen said alternatives included using systems that were already available and successfully in use. He said the problem with the previous upgrade’ dubbed NFE, was that because it was an integrated product, if one part didn’t work properly this impacted all the rest. He said that because the IT reorganisation would be done on a step-by-step basis, checking one component is successful before introducing the next, the costs were expected to be the same as in the budget for the NFE upgrade.

201,IBM,UPDATE 3-Berkshire profit doubles to record on Kraft Heinz,"* Operating profit down 4 pct as insurance weighs * Buffett-backed merger leads to $4.4 bln after-tax gain   (Adds comment, derivative losses, prior record profit) By Jonathan Stempel and Jennifer Ablan NEW YORK, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc  said quarterly profit doubled to a record high, reflecting a large gain on its stake in Kraft Heinz Co, while operating profit declined on weaker results from insurance underwriting. Third-quarter net income rose to $9.43 billion, or $5,737 per Class A share, from $4.62 billion, or $2,811, a year earlier. Operating profit fell 4 percent to $4.55 billion, or $2,769 per share, from $4.72 billion, or $2,876. Analysts on average expected operating profit of $2,720.60 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Among Berkshire’s larger businesses, profit fell 34 percent from insurance underwriting to $414 million, rose 12 percent at the BNSF railroad to $1.16 billion, and rose 13 percent to $786 million at Berkshire Hathaway Energy. “Overall, quite decent operating earnings,” said Jeff Matthews, a principal at the Ram Partners LP hedge fund and author of “Pilgrimage to Warren Buffett’s Omaha.” “Nothing wrong with that given the weakness in the industrial side of the economy.” Berkshire has close to 90 operating businesses including the General Re reinsurer, Lubrizol chemicals, NetJets business jets and Dairy Queen ice cream. Buffett, 85, has run Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire since 1965. Results reflected a roughly $6.8 billion pre-tax gain, or $4.4 billion after taxes, on Kraft Heinz. Buffett helped finance the July merger that created the food company, whose products include Oscar Mayer sandwich meats, Jell-O and Heinz ketchup, and is its largest shareholder with  26.8 percent stake. Berkshire had previously owned a majority of the former H.J. Heinz Co, and at the time of the merger had more than doubled its original investment in just two years. “Even given its large size, Berkshire can still pull off deals and investments that remain meaningful,” said James Armstrong, who invests $550 million as president of Henry H. Armstrong Associates in Pittsburgh. He said 20 percent of that sum is in Berkshire. Private equity firm 3G Capital owns about 24.2 percent of Kraft Heinz and has day-to-day oversight. It announced plans this week to close seven plants and cut 2,600 jobs there. Berkshire’s gain reflects “the hard work 3G has done cutting costs at Heinz and now Kraft,” said Matthews, who recently sold his Berkshire stock. “Warren Buffett, the billionaire, is getting richer on cost cuts while 2,600 families are getting poorer. It’s a shame.” Quarterly revenue at Berkshire rose 15 percent to $58.99 billion, largely from Kraft Heinz. Book value, reflecting assets minus liabilities and Buffett’s preferred growth gauge, was $151,083 per Class A share as of Sept. 30, up 0.9 percent from the end of June. Berkshire’s prior record profit was $6.4 billion in the second quarter of 2014, also helped by a one-time gain. Kraft Heinz helped Berkshire offset recent struggles with large investments such as International Business Machines Corp  and American Express Co and in operating units including the Geico auto insurer, as well as losses from derivatives. Berkshire said it had lost $2 billion on its IBM stock, or 15 percent of what it paid, as of Sept. 30 but still has “no intention” of selling its shares. The price of Berkshire’s Class A shares is down 10 percent this year, lagging the 2 percent gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500. Profit from insurance underwriting fell in part because of weakness at General Re and losses on variable annuity guarantee contracts at Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Geico recovered after a poor quarter, seeing pretax underwriting gains drop just 2 percent to $258 million. Like other insurers, Geico has experienced increased losses from accidents as people drive more, causing it to boost premiums. Berkshire said profit at BNSF was bolstered by “improved operating performance,” as the railroad spends $6 billion to add capacity and improve service following shortfalls in 2014. Buffett is working to finish Berkshire’s largest purchase, a roughly $31.7 billion takeover of aerospace parts maker Precision Castparts Corp. Berkshire had $66.26 billion of cash as of Sept. 30. Buffett has said he plans to spend about one-third of that on Precision Castparts. He wants to keep a $20 billion cash cushion. In Friday trading, Berkshire Class A shares fell $1,594 to $203,100, and its Class B shares fell 24 cents to $136.33.

205,IBM,Ex-IBM employee from China arrested in U.S. for code theft,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former software engineer for IBM Corp  in China has been arrested by U.S. authorities for allegedly stealing proprietary source code from his former employer, prosecutors announced on Tuesday. Jiaqiang Xu, 29, was charged in a criminal complaint filed in federal court in White Plains, New York, with one count of theft of a trade secret, as prosecutors accused him of trying to sell the stolen code to other companies. He was arrested on Monday after meeting with an undercover officer at a White Plains hotel, where authorities said he was recorded saying he used the code to make software to sell to customers. “Theft of trade secrets of the type alleged against Xu drains the lifeblood of innovation and competition, and is rightly a serious federal crime,” Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement. IBM was not identified by name in the complaint. But a LinkedIn profile for Xu said he was employed as a system software developer at IBM during the period in question. An IBM spokesman declined comment. Prosecutors said the source code at issue was related to proprietary software the company developed for a clustered file system, which facilitates faster computer performance. Xu, who began working at IBM in China in 2010, had full access to the source code before voluntarily resigning in May 2014, prosecutors said. According to the complaint, the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2014 received a report that someone in China was claiming to have access to the code and using it for business ventures. An undercover law enforcement officer posing as an investor seeking to start a data storage company subsequently contacted Xu, the complaint said. In March, Xu, after earlier sending the purported investor his resume, emailed the officer and another undercover agent about his past experience with the proprietary software and attached some sample code from his prior job. Xu later told one of the undercover officers he was willing to consider providing his company the code to allow it to develop its own data storage system, prosecutors said. After Xu offered to remotely install the proprietary software, the FBI in August arranged for a computer network to be set up to his specifications to do so.

208,IBM,IBM makes Munich its global center for industrial Internet push,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - IBM will make Munich the global headquarters for its push to build out the industrial Internet, capitalizing on a critical mass of automotive, electronics, healthcare, insurance and manufacturing companies centered in southern Germany.      IBM said on Tuesday that it will employ 1,000 staff to work with customers on industrial Internet projects in the Bavarian capital and is opening up eight satellite centers worldwide to help clients create smarter network-connected services.  The move comes amid press reports that the U.S.-based firm may cut around 18 percent of its German workforce over the next two years. Munich is home to Europe’s largest manufacturing company, Siemens, as well as carmaker BMW and truck firm MAN SE. Insurers Allianz and Munich Re < MUVGn.DE> have their headquarters in the city. IBM said it is working with Siemens Building Technologies and auto parts supplier Continental AG, among other major firms. The additional offices will be in Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul, as well as three U.S. cities, Sao Paulo in Brazil, and Boeblingen, a second city in Germany located near Stuttgart, a hub of the country’s car industry.     IBM said it aims to help businesses figure out how to make use of the dizzying amount of data that will be generated by network-connected devices, sensors and systems known as the Internet of Things (IoT).

209,IBM,IBM makes Munich its global centre for industrial Internet push,"FRANKFURT, Dec 15 (Reuters) - IBM will make Munich the global headquarters for its push to build out the industrial Internet, capitalizing on a critical mass of automotive, electronics, healthcare, insurance and manufacturing companies centred in southern Germany. IBM said on Tuesday that it will employ 1,000 staff to work with customers on industrial Internet projects in the Bavarian capital and is opening up eight satellite centres worldwide to help clients create smarter network-connected services. The move comes amid press reports that the U.S.-based firm may cut around 18 percent of its German workforce over the next two years. Munich is home to Europe’s largest manufacturing company, Siemens, as well as carmaker BMW and truck firm MAN SE. Insurers Allianz and Munich Re < MUVGn.DE> have their headquarters in the city. IBM said it is working with Siemens Building Technologies and auto parts supplier Continental AG, among other major firms. The additional offices will be in Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul, as well as three U.S. cities, Sao Paulo in Brazil, and Boeblingen, a second city in Germany located near Stuttgart, a hub of the country’s car industry. IBM said it aims to help businesses figure out how to make use of the dizzying amount of data that will be generated by network-connected devices, sensors and systems known as the Internet of Things (IoT).

213,IBM,IBM's gloomy forecast weighs down shares,"(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp’s shares touched a five-year low on Wednesday, a day after the company forecast weak earnings, underscoring challenges in its software business as it transitions to new growth areas. The company’s shares were down 6 percent at $120.40 in early trading. At least 11 brokerages lowered their price target on the stock. IBM forecast 2016 adjusted earnings of “at least” $13.50 per share, below the average analyst estimate of $15 per share, and reported a drop in revenue for the fifteenth straight quarter. While a strong dollar reduced IBM’s profit by $300 million in the fourth quarter and is expected to lower 2016 pre-tax profit by $1.3 billion, weakness in its software division remains a key concern. Revenue at IBM’s software business, which accounts for more than a quarter of the company’s revenue, fell about 11 percent to $6.78 billion in the fourth quarter. “We continue to think that the software segment represents the largest risk to ongoing top- and bottom-line financial performance, and thus also IBM shares,” BMO Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note to clients. The brokerage cut its price target on the stock to $135 from $155 and reaffirmed its “market perform” rating. IBM has been restructuring its business to focus on high-margin products such as cloud, mobile security and big data, but has failed to make up the shortfall with newer initiatives. “IBM Software is negatively impacted by two main factors in our view: ongoing transition to Cloud, product cycle less dynamic than major competitors (Oracle, Microsoft and SAP),” Societe Generale analysts said. The brokerage cut its price target to $120 from $140 and reiterated its “sell” rating. Up to Tuesday’s close, IBM stock lost 40 percent of its market value since touching a record-high of $215.90 in 2013.

The rout was across the board: all 30 Dow components and all 10 major S&P; sectors were in the red, with five down more than 3 percent. The small-cap Russell’s 2000 index fell 2.7 percent. The New York Stock Exchange recorded 1,314 stocks hitting new 52-week lows, while 809 sank to new lows on the Nasdaq, the most on a single day since Aug. 24 for both exchanges. The beaten-down S&P; energy sector’s 5 percent fall led the decliners. Chevron dropped 5.3 percent and Exxon  3.2 percent. U.S. crude prices sank 6.6 percent and Brent crude fell 4.7 percent as a supply glut bumped up against bearish financial news that deepened worries over demand. “The damage being done in energy is spreading,” said Brian Fenske, head of sales trading at ITG in New York. “Just getting up every morning and seeing the S&P; futures down 1-2 percent has a near-term psychological impact and puts some investors into risk-off mode,” Fenske said. At 11:51 a.m. ET (1652 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was down 436.37 points, or 2.72 percent, at 15,579.65. The S&P; 500 was down 53.24 points, or 2.83 percent, at 1,828.09, within touching distance of its October 2014 low. The Nasdaq Composite index was down 122.92 points, or 2.75 percent, at 4,354.03. The index has closed higher in only two of the 12 trading sessions this year. The CBOE volatility index, Wall Street’s fear gauge, jumped 11 percent to 29. Gold, a traditional safe haven in times of turmoil, rose more than 1 percent. Besides collapsing oil prices, fears of a slowdown in China, the world’s second-largest economy and a key market for U.S. companies, has also weighed on equities and commodities, leading to turbulent start to the year on Wall Street. The S&P; 500 has fallen 8 percent this year, losing more than $1.4 trillion in value, according to Thomson Reuters data. U.S. corporate earnings are unlikely to offer relief: S&P; 500 earnings on average are expected to fall 4.4 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. IBM fell 3.9 percent to $123.13 and Goldman Sachs  dropped 2.3 percent to $153.22 after the Dow components issued disappointing earnings reports. IBM weighed the most on the Dow, while Apple’s 2.7 percent drop weighed the most on the Nasdaq and the S&P; 500. Netflix was also swept up by the downbeat sentiment, dropping 6.8 percent to $100.51, despite reporting a better-than-expected growth in its subscriber base. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 3,009 to 114. On the Nasdaq, 2,451 issues fell and 335 rose. The S&P; 500 index showed no new 52-week highs and 169 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded three new highs and 655 lows.

Shares of the company, which receives more than half its revenue from markets outside the United States, fell 3 percent in extended trading on Tuesday. IBM forecast 2016 adjusted earnings of at least $13.50 per share, missing analysts’ average estimate of $15 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Schroeter expects currency volatility to lower 2016 pretax profit by $1.3 billion. The dollar index, which rose over 9 percent last year, is expected to rise 3.4 percent this year. “I think tech investors are focused on how (CEO) Ginni Rometty could turn the ship around given the headwind that traditional tech companies are seeing in this environment,” FBR Capital Markets analysts Daniel Ives told Reuters.

Revenue from “strategic imperatives”, which include cloud and mobile computing, data analytics, social and security software, rose about 10 percent in the fourth quarter. “I think this was another challenging quarter for Big Blue as the company struggled to find growth in the evolving IT spending environment,” Ives said.

221,IBM,Twitter users dislike Twitter exec exodus,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Twitter users mostly disliked the largest executive exodus at the online social media company announced late on Sunday, with some notable tweets criticizing CEO Jack Dorsey and even speculating on potential acquirers. The Thomson Reuters social media sentiment analysis index was negative overall on Twitter, falling close to its lowest levels in the past year following Dorsey’s tweet announcing the voluntary departures. “Only 5 of the 13 @Twitter execs that presented at their Nov 2014 analyst day are left,” read a post from Rich Greenfield (@RichBTIG), a media and technology analyst at BTIG, which was retweeted more than 500 times. Many tweets took jabs at Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) co-founder Dorsey, who returned as permanent CEO in October but still runs his other startup, online payment firm Square Inc (SQ.N).  “As we said about 1000 times on TV, print and radio. Jack Dorsey can’t run one let alone two companies. He is a destroyer of value,” tweeted Ross Gerber (@GerberKawasaki), chief executive of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, on Monday. The Thomson Reuters index tracks and aggregates positive, neutral and negative tweets on a company to generate a sentiment score. The index shows that sentiment toward Twitter has mostly been negative for the past two weeks.  CEO Dorsey said late on Sunday that media head Katie Jacobs Stanton, product head Kevin Weil, head of engineering Alex Roetter and human resources head Brian “Skip” Schipper, had all chosen to leave the company, without specifying exactly why.  According to social media analytics firm Zoomph, tweets about Twitter’s stock spiked following Dorsey’s tweet Sunday night and began trending on Monday morning.  Twitter shares fell 3 percent on Monday and are now down nearly 50 percent since Dorsey’s return on concerns he cannot revive stalled growth. The departures and share price decline prompted some to suggest the possibility of an acquisition. “With @twitter stock at an all time low, I wonder if it’s time for @IBM or @oracle to buy them?” tweeted Alan Lepofsky (@alanlepo) on Monday. A Twitter spokeswoman declined to comment.  Not all tweets were critical.  “@jack Hard time it might be for @twitter, but as head of a company, the respect you pay people when they leave speaks volumes. #respect,” tweeted Samson (@yeesamson), head of product innovation at Synergy Marketing.

Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM said on Tuesday that Fields, 55, was elected to join the board starting March 1. “Mark led the highly successful transformation of his company in a competitive industry where technology has driven innovation. He is leading Ford into a future where cars are not only vehicles, but increasingly becoming mobile technology platforms,” said Ginni Rometty, IBM chairman, president and chief executive officer. Under Fields, Ford has looked at alternatives to traditional car ownership, including mergers and acquisitions and partnerships. Ford and other automakers are increasingly focused on self-driving cars and the potential disruptive influence autonomous cars may have on future car ownership. They face potential threats from new competitors from Silicon Valley. Ford is exploring alternatives like car-sharing and other options to meet future transportation needs. Ford spokesman Mike Moran said “IBM is a global company with a rich history of innovation and disrupting its business model to deliver results – which is very complementary to what we are doing at Ford. Mark will bring unique insights to IBM, and his experience and new relationships serving on the IBM board will bring equal benefits back to Ford.” Fields briefly worked at IBM in sales and marketing after graduating from Rutgers and before attending Harvard Business School. Fields told Reuters earlier this month the automaker is exploring various options to boost its move into car-sharing, self-driving technology and services built on staying connected with customers during the 900 or so hours a year they are behind the wheel. The company has repeatedly declined to comment on reports that Ford is pursuing an alliance with Internet leader Alphabet Inc’s Google to collaborate on development of self-driving cars. Reuters reported in December that the companies have held talks and Fields met with Google co-founder Sergey Brin that same month to discuss the status of the talks. Ford is pursuing its own efforts to develop autonomous driving technology, and said earlier this month it would triple the size of its self-driving car test fleet to 30 vehicles. Ford’s previous CEO, Alan Mulally has been a director at Google since 2014. IBM also said two longtime board members, Alain J.P. Belda and William R. Brody, are retiring.

The company has repeatedly declined to comment on reports that Ford is pursuing an alliance with Internet leader Alphabet Inc’s Google to collaborate on development of self-driving cars. Reuters reported in December that the companies have held talks and Fields met with Google co-founder Sergey Brin that same month to discuss the status of the talks. Ford is pursuing its own efforts to develop autonomous driving technology, and said earlier this month it would triple the size of its self-driving car test fleet to 30 vehicles. Ford’s previous CEO, Alan Mulally has been a director at Google since 2014. IBM also said two longtime board members, Alain J.P. Belda and William R. Brody, are retiring.

224,IBM,"N.Y. stockbrokers' trades on IBM deal tip not illegal, jurors told","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyers for two former Wall Street stockbrokers urged jurors on Tuesday to reject a U.S. regulator’s claims they illicitly traded on a tip about an IBM Corp deal, saying their conduct did not constitute illegal insider trading. At the start of a trial in Manhattan federal court, lawyers for ex-Euro Pacific Capital Inc brokers Daryl Payton and Benjamin Durant admitted they traded on non-public information about IBM’s 2009 acquisition of SPSS Inc for $1.2 billion. But they said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was wrong to press claims that they broke the law, a position the defendants adopted after a recent appeals court ruling limited the reach of insider trading laws. “Trading on non-public information alone is not a violation of our nation’s securities laws,” Sean Hecker, a lawyer for Payton, said in his opening statement. But SEC lawyer David Axelrod told jurors that Payton and Durant knew their information was obtained illegally, and that they used it to make more than $883,600. “It was like sharks attracted to blood in the water,” Axelrod said. The trial marks a test for the SEC amid litigation over what constitutes insider trading, an issue the U.S. Supreme Court last month said it would review. The trial came after a December 2014 ruling by a federal appeals court in New York that traders could be held liable only if they knew a tip’s source received a benefit of “some consequence,” not just friendship, in exchange. That ruling overturned the convictions of two hedge fund managers. It prompted federal prosecutors in the IBM case to drop criminal charges against five defendants, including Payton, 40, and Durant, 39. All but Durant had pleaded guilty. But the SEC, which faces a lower burden of proof, chose to press its civil case against Payton and Durant. Andrew Ceresney, head of the SEC enforcement division, attended the trial’s start, signaling the importance of a victory for the regulator. Axelrod said Payton and Durant learned about the SPSS deal from Euro Pacific colleague Thomas Conradt, who heard about it from his roommate, Trent Martin. Martin, a Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc analyst, learned about the news from a friend at IBM’s law firm, who expected Martin to not tell anyone, Axelrod said.

227,IBM,Fitch Rates IBM's Sr. Unsecured Notes Offering 'A+',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 17 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+' rating to  International Business Machines Corporation's (IBM) $5 billion senior notes  offering. IBM will use net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including  potentially funding a portion of the company's acquisition of The Weather  Company. Fitch's action affects approximately $55 billion of debt, including  IBM's undrawn $10 billion revolving credit facility (RCF). A full list of rating  actions follows at the end of the release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings and Outlook reflect Fitch's expectations for relatively stable  operating performance, despite the continuation of a challenging operating and  competitive environment. On a constant currency and organic basis, Fitch expects  revenues will decline by the low single digits in the near term, driven by the  ongoing shift to cloud-based, from legacy, information technology (IT).  Near-term currency headwinds should remain significant, exacerbating top-line  pressures.  The ratings and Outlook incorporate Fitch's expectation that IBM's investments  in strategic imperatives (data, cloud and engagement) and achievement of  cloud-based efficiencies will result in double-digit growth and achieve  sufficient scale in these markets to offset long-term secular decline in legacy  IT demand in the medium term. Fitch also expects cash flows will remain  consistent and financial policies conservative through the intermediate term. Fitch expects IBM will sustain higher profit margins following the divestitures  of the less profitable semiconductor foundry and industry standard server (ISS)  businesses in 2014. Fitch estimates operating core operating EBITDA margin  (excludes operating EBITDA related to the financing business) was in the high  20% for 2015, versus a Fitch estimated low- to mid-20% historically.  Fitch expects strong annual free cash flow (FCF) of more than $7.5 billion  through the intermediate term, driven by lower capital spending following the  divestiture of the more capital-intensive foundry business. Fitch expects the  company will use 75%-85% of annual pre-dividend FCF for shareholder returns,  which the agency believes could result in incremental debt, given our estimate  that more than half of pre-dividend FCF is generated outside the U.S. Nonetheless, Fitch expects credit protection measures will remain solid for the  rating. Pro forma for the senior notes issuance, total leverage (total  debt-to-operating EBITDA) exiting 2015 was higher year-over-year at 1.9x, versus  1.8x for 2014. Core leverage (which excludes debt related to the financing  business) increased to 0.8x for 2015, pro forma for the senior notes issuance,  versus 0.6x 2014. The ratings and Outlook reflect IBM's: --Highly diversified customer base from both an industry and geographic  perspective.  --Considerable recurring revenue model from IBM's IT services, software and  financing, which in aggregate account for approximately half of total revenue  and reduce revenue and profit volatility. --Strong Market Position: Breadth and quality of product and service offerings,  resulting in leading revenue market share in IT services, middleware software,  servers and number three share of the total disk storage market. --Significant liquidity, supported by a solid cash position, committed credit  facilities and strong FCF. Fitch's concerns include: --Consistent, material increases in cash dividends long-term, which, in the  absence of commensurate growth in profitability, could pressure FCF and  financial flexibility, necessitating further increases in core debt to fund  acquisitions or share repurchases. --Significant and consistent research and development (R&D;) investments required  to keep pace with innovation, which constrain meaningful profit margin expansion  but also supports barriers to entry in certain markets.  --Expectations for debt-financed acquisitions in new IT to accelerate  transformation.  --Long-term threat to highly profitable mainframe demand and associated  operating system software (z/OS) from increasing penetration of industry  standard servers (ISS). KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Negative low-single-digit organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis  for 2016 but the resumption of positive organic growth over the medium term,  driven by growth in strategic imperatives businesses. --Profit margins will remain stable due to divestitures of less profitable  businesses. Fitch anticipates core operating EBITDA margins in the high 20%  range through the forecast period. --R&D; and capital spending levels remain consistent through the forecast period,  pro forma for the divestiture of the highly capital-intensive foundry business. --Annual cash pension contributions will remain in the $500 million to $600  million range. --75%-85% of pre-dividend FCF for shareholder returns, including 10% annual  dividend growth.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The ratings could be downgraded if Fitch expects: --A shift to more aggressive financial policies, including expectations core  leverage will be sustained in excess of 1.25x;  --Continued mid-single-digit organic negative revenue growth (constant currency  basis) or profitability pressures within IBM's traditional recurring core  franchises, signalling a weakening operating profile despite the company's  strategic imperatives growth focus.  Fitch believes the company's lack of a strategic rationale to maintain a higher  rating at the expense of financial flexibility required for acquisitions or  shareholder-friendly activities limits further positive rating actions. LIQUIDITY Fitch believes IBM's liquidity was strong at Dec. 31, 2015 and supported by: --$9.1 billion of cash and equivalents; and --An undrawn $10 billion RCF expiring on Nov. 10, 2019, which fully supports  IBM's commercial paper programs.  Fitch's expectation for more than $7.5 billion of annual FCF also supports  liquidity.  Pro forma for the senior notes issuance, total debt was $44.9 billion as of Dec.  31, 2015, which includes $6.5 billion of short-term debt. Fitch estimates $27.2  billion (61%) of total debt is attributable to IBM's Global Financing (IGF)  business with the remaining debt attributable to core (non-financing)  operations.  The main purpose of IGF is to facilitate clients' acquisition of IBM systems,  software and services by providing financial and capital management solutions.  IGF has a solid long-term operating record, and provides strategic advantages to  IBM in terms of attracting and retaining customers by delivering total  solutions. IBM also generates an annuity-like revenue stream associated with  multi-year leases. IGF's primary focus on IBM's products and clients mitigates some risks  associated with financing via a deep knowledge of its client base and clear  insight into the solutions being financed. Asset quality metrics have remained  relatively solid as a result of the relatively conservative underwriting culture  and strong risk management capabilities. IGF's capitalization remains solid for  the rating category and leverage levels continue to hover near management's  target of 7x. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch rates IBM's senior notes issuance as follows: --$900 million of floating rate notes (FRN) due Aug. 18, 2017; --$1.2 billion of 1.8% senior notes due May 17, 2019; --$900 million of 2.25% senior notes due Feb. 19, 2021; --$1.35 billion of 3.45% senior notes due Feb. 19, 2026; --$650 million of 4.7% senior notes due Feb. 19, 2046. Fitch currently rates IBM as follows: --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A+'; --Senior unsecured RCF 'A+'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A+'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'; --Commercial paper 'F1'.

232,IBM,Finland's Kone looks for service growth with IBM cloud deal,"HELSINKI, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Finnish elevator maker Kone Oyj  on Friday said it would start using IBM’s  cloud-based data analysis software as it looks to improve customer service and curb costs in a highly competitive shrinking market. Kone said the use of IBM’s Watson software platform would help it monitor data from its elevators and resolve problems before they occur. “It’s improvement in performance, reliability ... This is the next step of how to further accelerate our growth in the service business,” Chief Executive Henrik Ehnrooth said. Kone is facing intense competition on prices and a shrinking overall market, including a steep contraction in China. Ehnrooth said Kone is in the top two of world’s biggest players in the new equipment market, with United Technologies’  Otis division, and No. 4 in services. The other main players are Schindler and ThyssenKrupp. IBM has announced a range of partnerships over the past two years with industrial, automotive and telecoms companies to help them sort the enormous amount of data companies expect to generate from connected myriad devices to the Internet, from cars and trains to manufacturing lines and now, elevators.

237,IBM,"IBM inks deal with VMWare, tries to bolster cloud credentials","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Computing giant IBM (IBM.N) has expanded its partnership with VMWare (VMW.N), one of several initiatives it plans to announce Monday as it works to carve out a bigger role in the fast-growing field of cloud computing. The VMWare agreement will make it easier and faster for companies using VMWare’s virtualization products to deploy and run them on IBM’s cloud data centers, so those companies can easily connect their own data centers to the cloud. The idea is to make IBM’s services more attractive to VMWare’s customers. Virtualization allows one server to run many operating systems. It sits at the heart of cloud technology, by which businesses run key computing processes remotely and deliver them over the internet, which is more efficient and often cheaper than on-premises computing. “If you don’t embrace these new technologies, you won’t continue to survive,” said Jim Comfort, IBM’s chief technology officer for cloud, talking about IBM’s customers and cloud-based technologies. “It is transforming all industries.” IBM also plans to make it easy for developers using its tools to create applications in Swift, the programming language developed by Apple Inc (AAPL.O). That will smooth the way for old-school enterprises, which don’t traditionally work with Swift, to create apps for the iPhone and other widely used Apple devices.  To make it simpler for developers to build cloud-based apps, IBM is upgrading or creating other developer-oriented products.  WebSphere, its widely used software that helps developers link apps to the internet, will work more easily in cloud-oriented settings. IBM’s Bluemix software-development product will work smoothly with GitHub, a service that allows intensive collaboration on software writing. Last week, Bluemix competitor Pivotal Cloud Foundry announced it would team up with Cisco Systems (CSCO.O) to jointly sell products.  As revenue declines overall at IBM, in part due to customers turning to cheaper technology such as cloud-based services, it has looked for business in new areas, including trying to harness the cloud for its own growth.  Acquisitions make up a large part of the strategy. Last week, IBM announced it was buying medical-data company Truven Health for $2.6 billion.  It is unclear if IBM will be able to expand its newer cloud-based and analytics offerings at a strong enough pace to make up for weaknesses in its traditional businesses.  For 2015, revenue from its cloud offerings totaled $10.2 billion, out of total overall revenue of $81.74 billion.

It is unclear if IBM will be able to expand its newer cloud-based and analytics offerings at a strong enough pace to make up for weaknesses in its traditional businesses.  For 2015, revenue from its cloud offerings totaled $10.2 billion, out of total overall revenue of $81.74 billion.

239,IBM,Apple's fight with U.S. could speed development of government-proof devices,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The legal showdown between Apple Inc and U.S. law enforcement over encryption, no matter the outcome, will likely accelerate tech company efforts to engineer safeguards against government intrusion, tech industry executives say. Already, an emerging industry is marketing super-secure phones and mobile applications. An Apple executive said the company will strengthen its encryption if it wins its court battle with the federal government, which last week secured a court order requiring Apple engineers to help extract data from a phone associated with the mass shootings in San Bernardino. The executive spoke on condition of anonymity. An Apple spokesperson declined to comment publicly. If Apple loses the court case, the legal precedent could give the U.S. government broad authority to order companies to assist in breaking into encrypted products. But even a government victory could have unintended consequences for law enforcement, potentially prompting a wave of investment by U.S. tech companies in security systems that even their own engineers can’t access, said Jonathan Zittrain, co-founder of Harvard University’s Berkman Center for Internet & Society. “A success for the government in this case may further spur Apple and others to develop devices that the makers aren’t privileged to crack,” he said. The fast-growing online storage provider Box has already made it a priority to give customers sole custody of data, said  Joel De la Garza, chief information security officer at the company. The intent is to make it impossible for the company to access its customers’ data - even under a government order, he said. “Our goal is to achieve a `zero-knowledge’ state” for the company, he said, “where our customers have total control over their data.” It’s unclear whether Apple can - or would even want to - make smartphones the company can’t access. Two Apple employees familiar with the company’s security strategy said the company had no such plans. One immediate beneficiary of the government’s case against Apple is the niche industry, based mostly overseas, that has sprung up to design apps and phones to thwart snooping by governments, business rivals and criminals. In the more than two years since former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden revealed widespread spying via U.S. companies, a handful of companies have released secure phones with names such as BlackPhone, RedPhone or Priv that trumpet security as a prime selling point. Phones such as Boeing Co’s Black target government customers. Blackberry markets the Priv, an Android device, to corporate clients seeking more security. Others include Silent Circle, with launched its Blackphone 2 late last year, and Turing Robotic Industries, whose Turing Phone is due in April. Many more apps, such as Signal and Wickr, encrypt calls or texts messages. Those businesses could surge if the Apple fight drags on. “That’s going to happen,” said Chris Wysopal, cofounder and chief technology officer of software security company Veracode. “People will go out of the country, and there will be a market.” U.S. law enforcement officials have long fought for new laws to maintain access to private information that is harder to capture as people move to digital devices from traditional phone lines - which by law must be tappable. Most recently, the tech industry has fought off numerous efforts to get encryption legislation through Congress, including an attempt last year that died after President Obama declined to support it. FBI Director James Comey has been particularly outspoken in arguing that law enforcement efforts are hobbled by encryption, which he calls a safe haven for terrorists. The FBI did not respond to a request for comment on this story. Other law enforcement officials have said the tech industry fears are exaggerated, or in Apple’s case, even a marketing ploy. Apple, Google, Facebook and other companies also have accelerated efforts to implement encryption in the wake of Snowden’s disclosures about U.S. spying - including a program called Prism that culled private data from some of the largest U.S. tech companies. The revelations prompted companies to fight the perception that they were arms of the government and dented the overseas sales of companies including Cisco and IBM, as countries such as China shunned U.S. products. Apple’s iPhones now have longer passcodes tied to underlying encryption, making them far harder to hack. Facebook’s WhatsApp and others have adopted protocols under which they don’t have the means to unlock user communications. The fight between Apple and the government could give such security efforts a new urgency. It could also undermine trust in automated software updates, which have until now been viewed as one of the best ways to fix security flaws. Because U.S. prosecutors asked Apple to employ a software update as a means to break into the phone tied to the San Bernardino shootings, users now worry that updates could compromise the security of their devices, said Orion Hindawi, chief executive of security firm Tanium. “You are going to see a lot of people who thought auto-update was attractive backing away from that,” he said.

243,IBM,Buffett annual letter comes amid 'conspicuous' performance lag,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett will release his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway Inc shareholders after a year when its stock price lagged the broader market by the most since 2009, adding to years of underperformance. The letter, due Saturday, is a must-read on Wall Street, filled with his thoughts on investing, life and the Omaha, Nebraska company he has run for five decades. For some, navigating the present is of primary concern, as his shares have lagged the S&P; 500 for the last several years. “His underperformance is getting conspicuous. He must address it,” said Doug Kass, who runs Seabreeze Investment Partners in Palm Beach, Florida, and is selling Berkshire shares short. The price of a Berkshire Class A share fell 12.5 percent in 2015, compared with a 1.4 percent gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 including dividends, Reuters data show. That was the worst underperformance since 2009, and between 2009 and 2015, the S&P; gained about 163 percent; Berkshire, just 105 percent. Berkshire looks better when measured by book value, which looks to have gained 7.2 percent in 2015, according to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Meyer Shields. But since the financial crisis, it, too, has lagged the S&P; 500, based on Shields’ book value estimate.      Investors will look to see if there is any change in how Buffett views partnerships with investors such as Brazil’s 3G Capital, a cost-cutting specialist he teamed with on mergers creating Kraft Heinz Co and Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International Inc. Buffett faced questions at 2015’s meeting about 3G’s tendency to cut jobs aggressively. Berkshire now owns some 90 businesses, employing roughly 360,000 employees, including the Geico auto insurer, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream, and soon, Procter & Gamble Co’s Duracell battery business. Berkshire also owns dozens of stocks. But there, two big Buffett holdings, American Express Co and International Business Machines Corp have recently been dogs. Bill Smead, who invests $2.1 billion at Smead Capital Management in Seattle, said Berkshire’s stock price looks “incredibly attractive” at close to 1.2 times book value. Buffett has said Berkshire would buy back stock at that level.    One lingering question: Who will take over in coming years, given Buffett is 85, and second-in-command Charlie Munger is 92.    Analysts expect full-year operating profit of $17.3 billion, including profit of $2,814 per share in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

244,IBM,N.Y. brokers lose SEC insider trading trial over IBM deal tip,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal jury on Monday found two former New York stockbrokers liable for trading on confidential tips about an IBM Corp acquisition, despite a major appeals court ruling that made insider trading cases harder to pursue. In a victory for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, a federal jury in Manhattan found former Euro Pacific Capital Inc brokers Daryl Payton and Benjamin Durant liable for engaging in insider trading. The trial came after a 2014 appellate ruling limiting the scope of insider trading laws forced prosecutors to drop criminal charges against Payton, Durant and three others. The SEC continued to press civil charges over trades the two men placed before IBM announced its $1.2 billion acquisition of SPSS Inc in 2009. Payton, 39, and Durant, 40, conceded they traded on non-public information. But they argued that their trades did not constitute illegal insider trading, a position they adopted after the appellate ruling. Scott Morvillo, Durant’s lawyer, said he was confident the verdict would be reversed on appeal. Payton’s lawyers declined to comment. The trial came amid ongoing litigation over what constitutes insider trading, an issue the U.S. Supreme Court last month said it would review. The trial followed a December 2014 ruling by a federal appeals court in New York holding that traders could be held liable only if they knew a tip’s source received a benefit of “some consequence,” not just friendship, in exchange. After the ruling, which overturned two hedge fund managers’ convictions, a federal judge threw out guilty pleas by Payton and three other men in the IBM case. While prosecutors then dropped the criminal case, the SEC, facing a lower burden of proof, elected to move forward. According to the SEC, in 2009, Michael Dallas, an attorney at IBM’s law firm, told his friend Trent Martin that he was working on IBM’s acquisition of SPSS. While Dallas expected Martin, a Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc analyst, not to tell anyone, Martin bought SPSS stock and told his roommate, Thomas Conradt, a Euro Pacific employee, the SEC said. Conradt then told four Euro Pacific colleagues, including  Payton and Durant, who made $629,472 and $254,141, respectively, trading in SPSS before the deal’s announcement, the SEC said. Payton and Durant countered that Martin received nothing that would constitute an illegal benefit for his information, nor did they know about any benefit if it existed.

245,IBM,Buffett says owning IBM shares could prove a mistake: CNBC,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), told CNBC on Monday the firm’s ownership of IBM (IBM.N) shares could prove a mistake and that he was buying more U.S. stocks overall since the end of last year. “We’ve owned stocks that we’ve lost money in,” said Buffett, the world’s third-richest person. “If I’m wrong, you sell them out and take a big loss. We’ve done that on a few occasions with stocks and bonds over the years.” Berkshire, which held an 8.59 percent stake in IBM as of Dec. 31, 2015, said in an annual shareholder letter on Saturday that it planned to keep that stake despite a $2.6-billion paper loss at the end of last year. Buffett told the cable television network he did not think he was wrong for owning IBM shares so far, but said it “could be” a mistake.  He said he has been wrong before, noting Berkshire’s investment in troubled British grocer Tesco PLC (TSCO.L), which he characterized as a “huge mistake” in 2014.  “I bought Tesco, it went down, and it kept going down, and I was wrong about the company,” Buffett said on Monday. Berkshire no longer has a stake in the supermarket chain. Business was a bit “softer in many places” than he had anticipated four or five months ago, Buffett said, adding that in general, stocks would advance over time. “We have bought more stocks since the end of the year,” he said.  He did not know what the consequences of sustained low interest rates globally would be, but they made all assets more valuable, Buffett said.  Buffett, who is backing Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, said he had been surprised by the election season and “amazed” by Republican party developments, stating: “This takes the cake.” Buffett criticized Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, saying he has “a tendency to demonize institutions.” He weighed in on a privacy fight between Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and the U.S. government, saying privacy should trump security in smaller cases, but security should trump privacy in major cases. “If there is something major, something that the Attorney General or the head of the FBI would be willing to sign and go to a judge on and say, ‘we need this information and we need it now,’ I would be willing to trust that official,” he said. Buffett said he was a “little surprised” by Berkshire’s roughly $396 million investment in pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N), and that it was the decision of one of Berkshire’s top portfolio managers who each run $9 billion, a reference to Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.  Berkshire’s Kinder Morgan stake was revealed earlier this month in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing for the fourth quarter.  Buffett said Berkshire would likely not own Dow Chemical’s DOW.N common stock, but that he liked the company’s preferred shares.  He also said he hoped Britain would remain in the European Union and avoid a “Brexit.” ",2292016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-buffett-cnbc/buffett-says-owning-ibm-shares-could-prove-a-mistake-cnbc-idUSKCN0W21H9

The deal will help the U.S. lender free up capital to expand other activities in the country, said a source familiar with the sale who declined to be named because some details of the transaction were not public. Citigroup bought the stake in 2006 for about $610 million, implying that it earned more than $2 billion on its investment since then. The transaction is not material to the bank’s  earnings and is expected to close in the second half of this year, Citigroup said in a statement. China Life will more than double its stake in CGB from 20 percent after the purchase. Other main shareholders in CGB include State Grid Corp of China and CITIC Trust Co Ltd, each also owning a 20 percent stake. China’s biggest insurer said in a securities filing that besides buying Citigroup’s stake it is also buying shares in CGB owned by IBM Credit, a unit of International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N), lifting its holding in CGB to 43.7 percent. China Life agreed to pay about $554 million for the IBM Credit stake.        The sale comes after two failed attempts for CGB to go public the past years, which would have freed up investors including Citigroup to offload their shares in the stock market. The Chinese bank had mandated banks to arrange a dual listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai in 2011, before giving up on those plans and later trying for a listing in Hong Kong in 2014 as equity markets wobbled. With new Basel III rules making it disadvantageous for banks to hold minority stakes in other lenders, the sale would free up capital for Citigroup to expand other business in China, the source said. The bank has an investment banking joint venture with local brokerage Orient Securities Co (600958.SS) and is among the few international firms in China to offer sole branded credit cards. “This transaction is consistent with the simplification of Citi and allows us to focus our resources in China on growing our core franchise further,” Citigroup’s Asia Pacific Chief Executive Francisco Aristeguieta said in a statement. The deal also follows moves by Citigroup earlier in February to exit retail banking in Brazil, Argentina and Colombia as part of its efforts to cut costs and boost profitability.

250,IBM,IBM to purchase cyber security firm Resilient Systems,"(Reuters) - IBM Security plans to acquire private cyber security firm Resilient Systems, the computing giant said Monday, as part of a move to expand its role in the incident response market. The sale comes amid a consolidation in the cyber sector and a decline in valuations of public and private cyber firms. Some investors believe the companies were overvalued after a host of headline-grabbing hacks against the U.S. government and major corporations increased interest in the market.  Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The acquisition is being announced during the RSA security conference in San Francisco and expected to close later this year subject to regulatory review.  IBM (IBM.N) said it intends to retain the roughly 100 employees working at Resilient Systems, including Chief Executive Officer John Bruce, a former vice president at Symantec, and Chief Technology Officer Bruce Schneier, a prominent cryptographer, security blogger and author.  “Our intent is all these guys are going to come on board,” said Marc van Zadelhoff, general manager of IBM Security, told Reuters. “You acquire technology, but you really want to acquire people.” Known as Co3 Systems when it was founded in 2010, Resilient Systems has become a leading player in the high-demand field of incident response by helping private and government customers prepare for, detect and mitigate cyber breaches, said Jon Oltsik, senior principal analyst at Enterprise Strategy Group. Incident response is “hot in the market,” Oltsik said. “Customers are spending a lot of money on cybersecurity to address their shortcomings.” The acquisition comes against the backdrop of a U.S. cyber security market slogging through a funding slump, forcing some startups to sell themselves or cut spending. IBM also said on Monday it is creating X-Force Incident Response Services, which will leverage Resilient Systems’ technology and talent to help clients identify and respond to cyber threats.  The X-Force service will also rely on a new partnership with cyber firm Carbon Black, which IBM said will help its analysts conduct security forensics on compromised endpoint devices and discover where a breach first occurred.

252,IBM,UPDATE 3-Buffett says owning IBM shares could prove a mistake -CNBC,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), told CNBC on Monday the firm’s ownership of IBM (IBM.N) shares could prove a mistake and that he was buying more U.S. stocks overall since the end of last year. “We’ve owned stocks that we’ve lost money in,” said Buffett, the world’s third-richest person. “If I’m wrong, you sell them out and take a big loss. We’ve done that on a few occasions with stocks and bonds over the years.” Berkshire, which held an 8.59 percent stake in IBM as of Dec. 31, 2015, said in an annual shareholder letter on Saturday that it planned to keep that stake despite a $2.6-billion paper loss at the end of last year. Buffett told the cable television network he did not think he was wrong for owning IBM shares so far, but said it “could be” a mistake.  He said he has been wrong before, noting Berkshire’s investment in troubled British grocer Tesco PLC (TSCO.L), which he characterized as a “huge mistake” in 2014.  “I bought Tesco, it went down, and it kept going down, and I was wrong about the company,” Buffett said on Monday. Berkshire no longer has a stake in the supermarket chain. Business was a bit “softer in many places” than he had anticipated four or five months ago, Buffett said, adding that in general, stocks would advance over time. “We have bought more stocks since the end of the year,” he said.  He did not know what the consequences of sustained low interest rates globally would be, but they made all assets more valuable, Buffett said.  Buffett, who is backing Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, said he had been surprised by the election season and “amazed” by Republican party developments, stating: “This takes the cake.” Buffett criticized Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, saying he has “a tendency to demonize institutions.” He weighed in on a privacy fight between Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and the U.S. government, saying privacy should trump security in smaller cases, but security should trump privacy in major cases. “If there is something major, something that the Attorney General or the head of the FBI would be willing to sign and go to a judge on and say, ‘we need this information and we need it now,’ I would be willing to trust that official,” he said. Buffett said he was a “little surprised” by Berkshire’s roughly $396 million investment in pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N), and that it was the decision of one of Berkshire’s top portfolio managers who each run $9 billion, a reference to Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.  Berkshire’s Kinder Morgan stake was revealed earlier this month in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing for the fourth quarter.  Buffett said Berkshire would likely not own Dow Chemical’s DOW.N common stock, but that he liked the company’s preferred shares.  He also said he hoped Britain would remain in the European Union and avoid a “Brexit.” ",2292016,http://www.reuters.com/article/berkshire-buffett-ibm/update-3-buffett-says-owning-ibm-shares-could-prove-a-mistake-cnbc-idUSL2N1680HX

256,IBM,"UPDATE 2-Elliott buys large Qlik stake, eyeing sale to bigger buyer","(Reuters) - Elliott Management Corp bought a large stake in Qlik Technologies Inc, saying on Thursday that shares are cheap and the data analytics company is ripe for being taken over by a larger technology peer. Elliott, a $27 billion hedge fund founded by billionaire Paul Singer, said in a securities filing that it owned 8.8 percent of the U.S. company, a position Elliott paid around $200 million to purchase. Elliott said Qlik shares are significantly undervalued and that there are “strategic and operational opportunities” for the company that would boost its stock. “We believe Elliott could push for a sale of the company to one of the stack vendors, such as IBM or Oracle Corp.,” investment bank William Blair said in a research note, referring to firms that make hardware and software components needed for applications to run. William Blair, which rates the company an “outperform” said Qlik could fetch a 40 percent plus premium from a buyer. Elliott’s broad range of investments across the tech industry are overseen by Jesse Cohn, 35, who led previous investments in companies such as Compuware Corp, Riverbed Technology Inc. and Blue Coat Systems Inc, to name a few. All three were ultimately purchased by private equity firms. With market volatility taking a heavy toll on the private equity financing market, Elliott’s thesis for its Qlik investment shows how the hedge fund will lean more on strategic buyers for an exit opportunity rather than a leveraged buyout. Elliott started buying Qlik shares earlier this year, paying an average of $23.50 per share, for a total of 8.3 million shares, according to its filing.  Qlik, which began as a Sweden-based company and is now headquartered in Radnor, Pennsylvania, saw its shares jump 7 percent on Wednesday to $25.88 on the Nasdaq. Its stock is down more than 40 percent since mid-August. ""This situation is as classic as an Elliott activist situation gets - small to mid-cap technology company that has strategic opportunities,"" Ken Squire, of 13D Monitor, said in a note. Squire, who runs an activist mutual fund and also monitors activist investor filings, said that Elliott could also offer to buy Qlik itself. Elliott is now Qlik's largest shareholder.(1.usa.gov/1Y5oaWG) Qlik declined to comment.

257,IBM,Online retailer Yoox Net-a-Porter adopts IBM software,"PARIS (Reuters) - Online fashion retailer Yoox Net-a-Porter said on Monday it would adopt IBM’s software to manage orders, replacing technology developed by Yoox and Net-a-Porter prior to their merger in October.  Adopting a single IT platform marks a further step in the integration of the two companies, allowing them and individual client brands to monitor available stocks online and in-store as well as facilitate deliveries. Yoox Net-a-Porter said IBM’s Order Management software would help it deliver the stock synergies announced when the merger was agreed, which in turn would lead to higher sell-though and retail margins.      However, the IBM deal, whose financial details were not disclosed, is partly why Net-a-Porter (NAP) has lost key IT staff in recent months to rivals such as Amazon and Farfetch, sources close to the company told Reuters. NAP technology chief Hugh Fahy, for example, left last month to become chief technology officer at Internet retailer Not-on-the-high-street. The sources said that while IBM’s technology allowed for the creation of a harmonized IT platform, it was also available to all retailers and therefore hardly a differentiating factor in what has become a highly competitive market.  Some of the IT people who left NAP said IBM systems did not allow them to be as creative in terms of applications and functionalities as the company’s in-house systems. It also meant the job in the coming months was going to be more about integrating existing systems than creating new ones.  “It is like hiring carpenters to put together an Ikea cupboard,” one of the sources said.    NAP said the departures were part of the normal process associated with mergers.   Yoox NAP said the IBM platform would free up time for IT services team to focus on innovation and the development of bespoke e-commerce solutions. “This will enable us to speed up innovation and create a group level platform,” said Alex Alexander, Yoox NAP’s chief information officer, a systems integration specialist who worked at Barclays bank and joined last year from retailer Wal-Mart, where he designed an omni-channel strategy for its UK unit Asda.

259,IBM,U.S. Commerce Department to place restrictions on China's ZTE,"LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department is set to place export restrictions on Chinese telecoms equipment maker ZTE Corp (000063.SZ) for alleged violations of U.S. export controls on Iran, according to documents seen by Reuters. The restrictions will make it difficult for the company to acquire U.S. products by requiring ZTE’s suppliers to apply for an export license before shipping any American-made equipment or parts to ZTE. According to a Commerce Department notice that will be published next week in the U.S. Federal Register, the license applications generally will be denied. The restrictions will take effect Tuesday, Reuters has learned, and apply to any company worldwide that wants to ship American-made products to ZTE Corp in China. Those companies are not the target of the export curbs on ZTE. “This is a significant new burden on trade with ZTE,” a senior official at the Commerce Department told Reuters. The official declined to comment on whether the U.S. government might take further action against ZTE. The company can appeal against the action. ZTE, based in the southern Chinese boomtown of Shenzhen, said in a statement on Sunday that it was aware of media reports on U.S. export restrictions.  “ZTE is highly concerned about recent media reports relating to a U.S. Department of Commerce investigation,” the company said. “ZTE has been working with associated U.S. government departments on investigations since 2012 and maintains constant communication with associated departments and is committed to fully address and resolve any concerns.” Trade in shares in ZTE, which also sells consumer electronic devices such as smartphones in the United States, was suspended on Monday in Hong Kong and Shenzhen. The company did not offer an explanation.  “We believe the restrictions, if implemented, will cause significant supply problems to ZTE,” Jefferies analyst Cynthia Meng wrote in a note, adding that ZTE has major trading relationships with several U.S. companies including Qualcomm (QCOM.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and IBM (IBM.N).  Telecoms equipment and terminal businesses combined account for 80 percent of ZTE’s total revenue of 2015, Meng said. The company’s revenue for last year was expected to rise 23.8 percent to a record high of 100.8 billion yuan ($15.47 billion), preliminary results showed. The Commerce Department investigated ZTE for alleged export-control violations following reports by Reuters in 2012 that the company had signed contracts to ship millions of dollars worth of hardware and software from some of America’s best-known technology companies to Iran’s largest telecoms carrier, Telecommunication Co of Iran (TCI), and a unit of the consortium that controls it. The U.S. companies, which included Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), IBM (IBM.N), Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) and Dell Inc [DI.UL], have all said they were not aware of the Iranian contracts. It is not clear if any of the companies still do business with ZTE. Washington has long banned the sale of United States-made technology products to Iran. The Commerce Department’s investigation focused on whether ZTE had acquired American products through front companies and then shipped them to Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions. Commerce Department investigators obtained internal ZTE documents - some of which had been marked by the company as “Top Secret” - outlining an alleged sanctions-busting scheme. Reuters reviewed some of the documents.  The senior Commerce Department official declined to comment on whether ZTE had implemented that scheme.  The ZTE statement did not provide comment relating to the documents.    The day after the first Reuters article was published in March 2012, a ZTE spokesman said the company would “curtail” its business in Iran. The company later issued a statement saying: “ZTE no longer seeks new customers in Iran and limits business activities with existing customers.”  What effect the new export restrictions will have on ZTE’s global business is not clear. One undated internal ZTE document obtained by Commerce Department investigators and reviewed by Reuters states: “Our company has many technologies and components that came from suppliers in the U.S ... Lots of chips or software used in the products of our company are from U.S. suppliers.” One of ZTE’s websites also states that several leading U.S. technology companies, including Microsoft, Intel Corp (INTC.O), IBM and Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), are “key strategic partners of ZTE”. The terms of the partnerships are not described. A spokeswoman for Microsoft said the company had a licensing agreement with ZTE but could not confirm if the Chinese company purchases other products, such as software. The other U.S. companies did not respond immediately to requests for comment. The undated internal ZTE document also describes a proposal overseen by the company’s legal department that describes ways to export American products subject to U.S. sanctions by using shell companies to avoid getting caught. “The biggest advantage” of one method is that it will make it “harder for the U.S. government to trace it or investigate the real flow of the controlled commodities”, the document states. In its planned action against ZTE, the Commerce Department cites the proposal, stating that the company “planned and organized a scheme to establish, control and use a series of ‘detached’ companies to illicitly re-export controlled items to Iran in violation of U.S. export control laws”. It is not clear if the alleged scheme was implemented. Another internal ZTE document from August 2011 that discusses “U.S. export control risks” facing the company allegedly was signed by several top ZTE officials, including Shi Lirong, its president. The document, marked by the company “Top Secret” and “No spreading abroad without permission of ZTE”, begins “Dear company leaders”. It states that ZTE “has ongoing projects in all five major embargoed countries - Iran, Sudan, North Korea, Syria and Cuba”, adding that “all of these projects depend on U.S.-procured items to some extent, so export control obstacles have arisen”. The document goes on to cite “other risks” to ZTE, including its operations in the United States.  “R&D; employees at the U.S. Research Centers often travel between China and the U.S., carrying R&D; data,” it states, in an apparent reference to research and development. “This already severely violates the law.”   The document does not specify what law may have been violated. The company “needs to take preventative measures immediately, otherwise will face the risk of being investigated anytime”, the document states. The document also states that ZTE’s Iran project “can potentially put us at risk of being put on the Blacklist by the U.S.,” and that such an eventuality could leave the company facing “the risk of losing the supply chain of U.S. products”. ZTE Corp is one of the world’s largest telecoms equipment makers with operations in 160 countries, according to its website. It also is a major manufacturer of mobile handsets. Founded in 1985, its shares trade on both the Hong Kong and Shenzhen stock markets. Besides ZTE, the export curbs will apply to two of its Chinese affiliates, ZTE Kangxun Telecommunications Ltd and Beijing 8-Star, and an Iranian company, ZTE Parsian.

265,IBM,U.S. companies use social media to denounce laws seen as anti-gay,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. companies took to social media on Wednesday to denounce new laws enacted by southern states that target the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community.  Companies like International Business Machines Corp and Herbalife International Inc used Twitter to criticize a North Carolina measure targeting transgender bathrooms and a Mississippi ‘religious freedom’ law allowing people to deny wedding services to gay couples. The tweets illustrate how diversity-minded corporations are using their clout as major employers in Republican-controlled states to wield influence against measures they consider LGBT discrimination. Social media provides a way to communicate their views to the masses.  Herbalife tweeted, “We are proud to join @equalitync, @HRC and a chorus of business voices opposed to #HB2,” referring to     the North Carolina law that requires people to use bathrooms or locker rooms in schools and other public facilities that match the gender on their birth certificate, rather than their gender identity.  “Discrimination of any type should not be tolerated.” Several technology executives also criticized a Mississippi bill allowing people with religious objections to deny wedding services to same-sex couples after Governor Phil Bryant signed it into law on Tuesday. IBMPolicy (‏@IBMpolicy), the Twitter account for government affairs at IBM, tweeted, “Disappointing that Mississippi Gov @PhilBryantMS signed H.B. 1523. IBM strongly opposes this discriminatory bill.” Brad Smith (‏@BradSmi), president and chief legal officer at Microsoft Corp, said, “Very disappointing to see the news from Mississippi. These laws are bad for people, bad for business, and bad for job growth. #HB1523” The tweets follow PayPal Holdings Inc’s move on Tuesday to cancel plans to open a global operations center employing 400 workers in Charlotte, North Carolina. At least one other company said it would also reconsider expanding in North Carolina. Ric Elias, chief executive of Red Ventures, a sales and marketing company, posted a letter on Twitter that said he was reconsidering adding jobs in a state that tolerates discrimination.  Similar disputes have broken out between business interests and social conservatives in other Republican-controlled states since the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage in 2015. In Georgia, companies have won the outcome they were seeking. In late March, after top executives at companies ranging from Salesforce.com Inc to Unilever PLC protested a bill allowing faith-based organizations to deny services to LGBT people, the governor there said he would veto it. Unilever Chief Executive Paul Polman tweeted on March 20, “Inclusive society critical to business. Many will reconsider investment if @governerdeal passes #hb757.” ",4062016,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-transgender-companies/u-s-companies-use-social-media-to-denounce-laws-seen-as-anti-gay-idUSL2N1791E6
266,IBM,Augusta National masters art of minimal sponsorship,"AUGUSTA, Georgia (Reuters) - Sports sponsorship deals, even multi-million dollar ones, follow a pretty basic process. This applies nearly everywhere, but not at the Masters golf tournament. In most corners of the world, a property and a brand get together in a conference room. The property tells the brand how much money it will require to attach the brand’s name to a team, building or event. Negotiations follow concerning the deal’s duration and payment schedule, before marketing agency reps and lawyers handle the fine print. Hands are shaken and an announcement is made. But at Augusta National Golf Club, the permanent home of the Masters, business is conducted quite differently – and almost all of it is shrouded in secrecy. For Masters chairman Billy Payne and Augusta National’s leadership, less has always been more when it comes to attaching sponsors to one of one sport’s prestige properties. At virtually every other golf tournament on the planet, an abundance of sponsors is considered a positive – there is always room for another logo somewhere on the course. At the Masters, which this week celebrates its 80th edition, sponsors are limited to five: global sponsors AT&T;, IBM, and Mercedes-Benz, and international partners UPS and Rolex. All five are estimated to pay upwards of $6 million annually to have zero signage in view on property, share a combined four minutes of ads per broadcast hour, and follow extremely stringent, narrow rules about how their association with the world’s most exclusive golf tournament can be promoted. Take IBM, for example. The Rochester, New York computing stalwart is responsible for developing and maintaining the Masters official website, and handheld and iPad apps, as well as providing data services and analysis, courtesy of its “Watson” mega computing system, that broadcasters use on air.  A small IBM logo sits atop the top right hand corner of each digital display, but that is as heavy handed as the branding gets. And IBM does not swap these technology services in exchange for a sponsorship platform. To the contrary, it pays millions of dollars each year for the privilege of providing them. Why? As Forbes has noted, “the digital platforms provided to the Masters as part of IBM’s robust sponsorship of the event serve to show potential business partners the capacity of the 21st century IBM” - not the bulky business computing of old. The Masters and the U.S. Open, which it also sponsors, are the perfect events to reach IBM’s target demographic: business owners. In 2014, Mercedes-Benz upgraded its corporate involvement at the Masters by replacing ExxonMobil as one of the tournament’s three global sponsors. Mercedes had been a partner since 2008; ExxonMobil had been a Masters global sponsor since 2005 – and true to Augusta National form, was tightlipped about its reasons for dissolving the partnership thereafter. While the German luxury automaker also sponsors the British Open and PGA Championship, it craved the exclusivity of the limited commercial space in Masters domestic telecasts. “The Masters is the most prestigious golf tournament in the world. It is a great honor for Mercedes-Benz to now be associated with the Masters Tournament as one of the three global sponsors,” Joachim Schmidt, the company’s executive vice president of sales and marketing, said at the time.

Although the terms of each sponsor’s agreement are not disclosed, sponsorship analyst IEG has calculated the total annual global contribution to be near $18 million, and that was before international partners UPS and Rolex joined the party.

272,IBM,"IBM reports worst revenue in 14 years, shares slide","(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) reported its worst quarterly revenue in 14 years as results from newer businesses including cloud and mobile computing failed to offset declines in its traditional businesses, sending shares down nearly 5 percent in extended trading. Revenue of the world’s largest technology services company fell 4.6 percent to $18.68 billion in the first quarter, but beat analysts’ average estimate of $18.29 billion. It was the 16th straight quarter of revenue decline for IBM. Under Chief Executive Ginni Rometty, IBM has been moving toward areas such as cloud-based services, security software and data analytics, while trimming its traditional hardware business by exiting low-margin businesses. However, revenue in the company’s newer businesses is failing to make up for declines in its traditional segments. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi, in a research note before results, wrote that the falloff in IBM’s traditional businesses was dwarfing the company’s ability to capture new revenue. Revenue from “strategic imperatives,” which includes cloud and mobile computing, data analytics, social and security software, rose about 14 percent in the first quarter. But revenue from the services and hardware segments fell 4.3 percent and 21.8 percent, respectively, in the quarter. Excluding items, IBM earned $2.35 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $2.09.  The company received a $1 billion refund in the quarter that lowered its effective tax rate to a negative 95.1 percent compared with 19.5 percent last year. The company maintained its full-year adjusted earnings guidance of at least $13.50 per share. Analysts on average were expecting $13.55, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

276,IBM,IBM launches new cloud services for blockchain,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM on Friday announced new services to help companies  design and develop blockchain technology in a secure environment in the cloud, a network of computers where users are  increasingly storing their data and computing work. The blockchain, the underlying technology behind bitcoin, is a digital tool for doing a slew of functions such as recording and verifying transactions. The technology, according to its many supporters, would make it easier to create cost-efficient business networks without requiring central control. The interest in the blockchain surged last year when Wall Street’s major players such as Goldman Sachs delved into the technology and saw it as a way to solve inefficiencies in financial markets. “Clients tell us that one of the inhibitors of the adoption of blockchain is concerns about security,” said Jerry Cuomo, vice president, Blockchain at IBM in a statement.  “While there is a sense of urgency to pioneer blockchain for business, most organizations need help to define the ideal cloud environment that enables blockchain networks to run securely in the cloud.” IBM said it is addressing security issues in several ways, including cloud services with the highest Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS 140-2) and Evaluation Assurance Levels (EAL) in the industry to support the use of blockchain in government, financial services and healthcare.  The technology company also announced the opening of an IBM Garage in New York and London. These garages are similar to research labs on the blockchain created by several major financial institutions over the past year. IBM’s garages are dedicated to helping clients design and develop their blockchain networks, said Cuomo. Garages in Tokyo, London and Singapore will also open in the coming weeks to enable clients to collaborate with IBM experts on the design and implementation of blockchain for business.

277,IBM,Warren Buffett says more likely to buy IBM shares than sell: CNBC,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, said Monday he would be more likely to buy than sell IBM shares over the next two years, and that he did not seek to profit from global central bank actions.  Buffett, who presided over Berkshire’s 51st annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska over the weekend, told cable television network CNBC: “We would be much more likely to buy more in the next 12 or 24 months than we would be to sell shares, but we will make that call as time goes along.” Buffett, whose Berkshire held an 8.59 percent stake in IBM as of the end of last year and who has caught some flak for his stake, said his cost basis in IBM was around $170 a share and that he had still never sold a share.  IBM shares fell 0.4 percent to $145.34 late Monday afternoon.  Buffett also said he did not seek to profit from global central bank monetary policies, but that low and negative interest rates could produce an unanticipated reaction.  “It’s a fascinating movie to watch. I don’t try to make money off the movie,” Buffett said.  “If currency in a bank is worth less than currency in your hands or in a mattress, that could produce something in the way of behavior that nobody has ever anticipated.” Buffett, whose Berkshire is an American Express shareholder, said the company’s loss of its contract with retailer Costco Wholesale Corp was “significant” but he agreed with American Express Chief Executive Kenneth Chenault’s decision to split from Costco.  He said American Express would remain “under attack” from alternative payment methods, but he was confident in his stake.  “Costco was a very, very, very valuable co brand to have for American Express, but that value wasn’t limitless,” he said.  Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger told CNBC, however, that he would have made the opposite decision with regard to American Express’s contract with Costco.  Buffett also criticized companies that repurchase their own shares at too high a price: “They have in mind a limit as to what they pay for any business they buy except their own, and it has become fashionable to repurchase shares.” Buffett, who has ordered that most of the money he is not giving away at his death should be placed in an index fund, also said active investing as a whole was “certain” to produce worse-than-average results.  Buffett and Munger added to previous criticisms they have made of embattled drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc’s drug-price hikes.  Buffett said there “really wasn’t any defense” for Valeant’s price hikes, while Munger said Valeant was “leading the pack” of certain industry players who were raising prices dramatically. “I don’t think you’d want your son to grow up and run a company in the manner that Valeant was run,” Buffett said.  Munger said he suspected it was “massively stupid” for the U.S. government to rely heavily on printing money and lightly on fiscal stimulus for infrastructure, and that the United States would have been better off with more fiscal stimulus.

Groupon filed its lawsuit on Monday with the federal court in its hometown of Chicago, two months after IBM accused Groupon of patent infringement in a separate lawsuit. “IBM is trying to shed its status as a dial-up-era dinosaur” by infringing the rights of “current” technology companies such as Groupon, according to Groupon spokesman Bill Roberts. Doug Shelton, an IBM spokesman, said: “This counter suit is totally without merit.” IBM’s full name is International Business Machines Corp. The latest lawsuit concerns IBM’s WebSphere Commerce platform, which Groupon said lets merchants send messages to customers with GPS-enabled devices based on their real-time locations, and their use of social media including Facebook. Groupon said the platform infringes a December 2010 patent, and that it deserves royalties based on the “billions of dollars” of revenue that Armonk, New York-based IBM has received through its infringement. “IBM, a relic of once-great 20th Century technology firms, has now resorted to usurping the intellectual property of companies born this millennium,” Groupon said in its lawsuit. On March 2, IBM accused Groupon in a federal lawsuit in Delaware of infringing four patents, including two related to Prodigy, a late-1980s forerunner to the Internet. “Over the past three years, IBM has attempted to conclude a fair and reasonable patent license agreement with Groupon, and we are disappointed that Groupon is seeking to divert attention from its patent infringement by suing,” Shelton said.

287,IBM,Warren Buffett's Berkshire takes $1 billion bite of Apple,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) revealed a more than $1 billion stake in Apple Inc (AAPL.O) in a rare foray into the technology sector, which Buffett has largely shunned apart from a poorly performing investment in IBM (IBM.N).  Shares of Apple rose 3.7 percent on the news, closing up $3.36 at $93.88. Berkshire made its investment in the first quarter, before the iPhone maker in April reported its first quarterly revenue decline in 13 years. The investment was announced amid an increasing view among investors that Apple may deserve a lower valuation because its heady growth days may be over. However, Apple has a strong balance sheet and management, attributes long favored by Berkshire. “It makes sense because it’s a consumer company disguised as a technology company with a great business model, strong cash flow and a cheap valuation,” said Jeff Matthews, author of books about Buffett and a principal at the Ram Partners LP hedge fund. “It’s not a leap of faith.” In a regulatory filing detailing most of its stock holdings, Berkshire said it held 9.81 million Apple shares worth $1.07 billion as of March 31. The value of the stake has since fallen to about $921 million, even with Monday’s gain. Berkshire’s largest technology bet has been Buffett’s roughly $12.1 billion stake in International Business Machines Corp, an investment now more than $1.6 billion in the red.   Apple stock “is stunningly cheap, and it has a massive pile of cash,” said Steve Wallman, founder of Wallman Investment Counsel in Middleton, Wisconsin, who has owned shares of Berkshire since 1982 and Apple since 2003. “Apple is not getting credit for research and development it is doing behind the scenes.” An Apple spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment. The Apple investment was made by one of Buffett’s two stockpicking deputies, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, his assistant said in an email to The Wall Street Journal. Combs and Weschler, who ran hedge funds before joining Berkshire, each invest about $9 billion and usually make smaller wagers, while Buffett, known as the Oracle of Omaha, makes bigger investments such as IBM. Investors said Combs may have been the Apple buyer. He  invested in chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) for Berkshire in 2011. Buffett’s assistant did not respond to a request for comment. In April, Apple said revenue for the quarter ended March 26 declined as an increasingly saturated smartphone market hurt iPhone sales, which fell for the first time.  Chief Executive Tim Cook is looking to develop other technologies for the Cupertino, California-based company, and last week unveiled a $1 billion investment in Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing. Apple’s market value last week dipped below that of Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), even though Apple generates roughly triple the revenue and profit. Before Monday, shares of Apple were down by a third from their April 2015 peak. Synovus Trust Company portfolio manager Daniel Morgan, noting that Buffett is known as a value buyer, said; “That kind of puts the icing on the cake that Apple now is probably considered more of a mature technology company, like we would think of Microsoft, Intel or Cisco. “I don’t think we can put them in the same bracket right now as Google, Amazon (AMZN.O) or Netflix (NFLX.O),” said Morgan said, who owns Apple because of its low price-earnings ratio and high dividend yield. “It’s a value stock that has the potential for a big growth,” said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors in New York who also holds Apple stock. Hedge fund manager David Einhorn is also a fan, and his firm Greenlight Capital on Monday said it boosted its Apple stake by 31 percent in the first quarter. Other prominent investors have retrenched. Last month, billionaire Carl Icahn said he sold his Apple stake on concern about the company’s relationship with China. David Tepper’s Appaloosa LP sold its stake in the first quarter, while Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates and Chase Coleman’s Tiger Global Management slashed their stakes. Leon Cooperman’s Omega Advisors also shed its Apple stake, a person familiar with the matter said. Despite his traditional aversion to technology sector, Buffett told CNBC on Monday that he offered to help Dan Gilbert, the chairman of Quicken Loans and owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team, finance a bid for internet company Yahoo Inc YHOO.O. Reuters first reported Buffett’s involvement on Friday.  While Buffett told CNBC he would not be an equity partner, he could collect dividends or interest on the financing, and perhaps take an equity stake later. “Buffett has always restricted himself from investing in things he doesn’t know or understand, and staying within his circle of confidence,” said Richard Cook, co-founder of Cook & Bynum Capital Management LLC in Birmingham, Alabama, which invests 8 percent of the $350 million it manages in Berkshire. The Apple investment may have been made with proceeds from the sale of AT&T; Inc (T.N) stock, as Berkshire exited what had been a $1.6 billion stake. In Monday’s filing, Berkshire also reported higher stakes in IBM, Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N), Deere & Co (DE.N) and Visa Inc (V.N), and lower stakes in MasterCard Inc (MA.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N).

301,IBM,India dials back chip ambitions as investors spurn plant funding,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India’s ambitious plan to be a major player in semiconductors, taking on the Chinese and churning out locally-made chips for a new generation of smartphone users, has proved to be a little too ambitious. The government boldly announced three years ago it would host two new $5 billion chip plants as part of a project to become a global manufacturing powerhouse, creating thousands of jobs, reducing its need for imports and taking on global rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and GlobalFoundries. But potential investors have not materialized, put off by India’s wobbly infrastructure, unstable power supply, bureaucratic red tape and poor planning, according to analysts and industry insiders. Just weeks after Jaypee Infratech, which was partnering IBM Corp and Israel’s Tower Jazz, abandoned plans for one of the big chip plants, STMicroelectronics NV is set to scrap plans to build the other $5 billion plant as its main local partner failed to raise enough money from skeptical investors, government officials said. “We’ve had a lot of issues with the original (semiconductor) plan,” a top official at India’s Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DEITY) told Reuters. “The technology curve has moved ahead in the last three years, the global environment has changed and China has emerged as a big player.” Two other officials at the department said a consortium led by Indian start-up Hindustan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (HSMC) with STMicro and Malaysia’s Silterra had not been able to raise the funding for the plant, and it might be scrapped. Investors doubted the potential of the Indian government’s plan to set up a 22 nanometer (nm) chip fabricator as the industry’s cutting-edge manufacturing has already shifted to smaller 14 nm chips, and is expected to move to sub-10 nm in the next three years, the officials said. “Our original estimates for chip demand were incorrect, and we decided to postpone our plant until 2020 since there’s no market for semiconductors in India yet,” HSMC founder Deven Verma told Reuters. Verma said the consortium had not yet closed financing for the plant, but had commitments for only 40 percent of the required funding. Operations had been expected to start this year. STMicro declined to comment. India is now toning down its ambitions and setting its sights on low-end chip making, the government officials said. DEITY plans to attract low-tech component companies including makers of printed circuit boards (PCBs), integrated circuits and analog chips. “If we target manufacturers of electronic components to look at India for their global production, we can start by manufacturing components such as PCBs and ICs locally, and that will give a much-needed boost to manufacturing in India,” said one of the two top government officials. To that end, the government has courted foreign manufacturers including Apple Inc to set up plants in India, though analysts say the country needs first to bulk up its component making capabilities. “It’s crazy if India thinks it can compete with China on something like chip manufacturing when our electronics industry is a shambles,” said Ganesh Ramamoorthy, an analyst at research firm Gartner. India’s ambitions in electronics manufacturing include cutting net imports to zero by 2020, from about $40 billion last year. It is the world’s fastest growing smartphone market with over 100 million sold last year - but almost all of those phones’ chips and circuits are imported. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has attracted some phone makers, including Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi, to set up assembly plants in India. Samsung Electronics also manufactures some smartphones locally.

304,IBM,Bankruptcy filing by Brazil's Oi rattles global supply chain,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil’s biggest bankruptcy filing ever is sending shockwaves far beyond the recession-hit country’s borders as operator Oi SA seeks creditor protection from global telecoms suppliers and export banks around the world.  Oi is seeking protection on over 500 million reais ($150 million) of accounts payable to international providers from Nokia Corp and Ericsson to IBM Corp and Alcatel-Lucent SA, according to court documents reviewed by Reuters. The biggest Brazilian fixed-line carrier also owes about $1 billion to foreign development banks in China, Finland, Canada and Germany, which encouraged exports to Brazil during a recent surge in spending on wireless and broadband networks. That cycle came crashing to a close this week with Oi’s record bankruptcy filing in a Rio de Janeiro court, punctuating the broader slump in a sector curtailing investments to protect profits amid Brazil’s worst economic recession since the 1930s. While those debts to suppliers are dwarfed by more than 17 billion reais in bank loans and some 34 billion reais in bonds, they may create headaches for equipment and service providers already struggling with slumping investments in the country.     “The focus is on keeping the company working. That’s what everybody wants,” said a source close to the company. “Obviously you don’t want to affect suppliers, but that has to be discussed in court.” Oi has refrained from making public comments while the judge in Rio evaluates its petition.     The company was expected to be the only telecom group in Brazil to raise capital spending this year, Credit Suisse Securities analysts said last month in a note that forecast an end to the industry’s recent investment cycle driven by fourth-generation mobile technology. Although it did not announce an investment target for the year, Oi invested around 1.2 billion reais in the first three months of the year, about a quarter of the 4.5 billion reais that Credit Suisse analysts forecast for the full year. The question facing Oi now is how to pay for already acquired equipment as it seeks an in-court reorganization of 65.4 billion reais in bonds, bank debt and operating liabilities. Oi has made no changes to its capital spending plans and is doing everything it can to keep operations running normally, said the source, who asked not to be named given the legal proceedings under way. Brazil’s bankruptcy protection law allows Oi to stay current on its bills going forward, but freezes all payments on services rendered before the Monday filing while creditors negotiate how to settle the debts. Its biggest outstanding debt to a foreign supplier appears to be 129 million reais due to Brazilian subsidiaries of Finland’s Nokia, which in 2013 bought out partner Siemens AG in their network equipment venture.  Nokia’s receivables are more than twice the 53 million reais due to Chinese runner-up Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL].  Asked about possible Oi-related provisions, Nokia, IBM, Alcatel and Ericsson declined to comment. Huawei did not respond to questions.

IBM also stood by its full-year forecast for adjusted earnings of at least $13.50 per share, dispelling any concerns about the impact from Britain’s vote to leave the European Union.  “Investors were a little bit nervous about the guidance, and they’ll find a little relief that the company maintained that, despite some headwinds associated with their high sales exposure to Europe,” said Edward Jones analyst Bill Kreher. IBM receives nearly a third of its revenue from Europe, Middle East and Africa. Chief Executive Ginni Rometty’s push toward cloud-based services, security software and data analytics seems to have paid off with a 12 percent rise in revenue from “strategic imperatives” in the second quarter. Cloud revenue jumped 30 percent, compared with 34 percent in the preceding quarter. “For us, it’s not about being the biggest cloud, that’s not our goal, our goal is to have the best hybrid capabilities,” Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter said in an interview. Total revenue dropped 2.8 percent to $20.24 billion for the quarter ended June 30 from a year earlier, hurt by a fall in its traditional hardware businesses. The company’s global business services revenue, which includes consulting, fell 2 percent, while its systems unit, which includes systems hardware, dropped 23.2 percent. However, the company’s 17th straight quarterly revenue decline was not as steep as expected. The average analyst estimate was $20.02 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income fell to $2.50 billion, or $2.61 per share, from $3.45 billion, or $3.50 per share. Excluding items, IBM earned $2.95 per share, beating average analyst estimate of $2.89. IBM’s shares, which had risen 16 percent this year through Monday, were up 0.7 percent in extended trading.

313,IBM,IBM's full-year earnings forecast greeted with skepticism,"(Reuters) - IBM Corp (IBM.N) has given itself a tall order - a full-year profit target many analysts think it will have trouble meeting. Big Blue has made solid progress as it shifts into high-growth areas such as cloud-based services, and both profit and revenue beat analysts’ expectations in the second quarter. But the company may have over-promised by sticking to its full-year adjusted earnings forecast of at least $13.50 per share, analysts said, especially after it indicated that profit in the current quarter would come in below estimates. In order to meet the target, IBM would need to turn in its best sequential improvement in profit in nine years in the fourth quarter, according to Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi. “Possibly achievable? Yes, but unlikely, at least statistically,” Sacconaghi said. IBM, which reported a profit of $14.92 per share from continuing operations last year, has missed its full-year target for the last two years. The company’s shares were down slightly at $159.53 in early afternoon trading on Tuesday, having risen about 16 percent since the start of the year. Sacconaghi raised his price target to $140, from $135 in April, mainly to reflect the rise in the S&P; 500 over the past three months. On a post-earnings conference call with analysts on Monday, Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter indicated IBM would report a third-quarter profit of $3.11 to $3.24 per share. That means IBM will need to report a profit of between $4.96 and $5.09 per share in the fourth quarter to hit its target. Analysts on average expect earnings of $3.22 per share for the third quarter and $4.96 in the fourth, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, which would mean IBM would earn $13.48 per share for year, two cents shy of its target. Investors and analysts have raised doubts about IBM’s ability to increase revenue growth in its newer cloud-based and analytics businesses at a pace fast enough to make up for falling revenue in its traditional hardware businesses. Still, at least eight brokerages raised their price targets on IBM’s stock after the company reported its smallest revenue decline in eight quarters. Citigroup raised the most, to $160 from $140, saying there were “marginally more positives than negatives vs. prior quarter earnings, which were typically disappointing.” The median price target on the stock is $160 - around where it was trading on Tuesday. Of the 25 brokerages covering IBM, seven rate it a “buy” or higher, 13 “hold” and five “sell” or lower.

316,IBM,IBM steps up efforts in fight against Zika,"(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp said on Wednesday it would provide its technology and resources to help track the spread of the Zika virus. Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), a leading research institution affiliated with the Brazilian Ministry of Health, plans to use IBM’s technology to analyze information from official data about human travel patterns to anecdotal observations recorded on social media. Global health officials are racing to better understand the Zika virus, which has caused a major outbreak that began in Brazil last year and has spread to many countries in the Americas.  IBM also said it plans to donate a one-year subscription feed of highly local, daily rainfall, average temperature and relative humidity data to the U.S. Fund for United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF). Rainfall, temperature and humidity play key roles in the development of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which carries Zika as well as dengue, chikungunya and Yellow Fever. IBM is also collaborating with the New York-based Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies to collect and mine biological and ecological data to help devise algorithms that can determine which primates are carriers for the virus. IBM also runs the ‘OpenZika project’ on the company’s World Community Grid, a crowd-sourced supercomputer.  The initiative allows scientists in the United States and  Brazil to screen millions of chemical compounds to identify candidates to combat the virus.  More than a dozen small biotech firms and other organizations are developing vaccines against Zika, which is linked to birth defects and neurological disorders, although most work is at a nascent stage.  Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc, said in March it was working with UNICEF to analyze data in an effort to map and anticipate the spread of the virus.

320,IBM,"Big tech may halt earnings recession, if it delivers Q3 numbers","NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Technology heavyweights might be all that keeps the U.S. earnings recession from extending into a fifth quarter in September if they hit the higher estimates Wall Street is calling for.  A bright spot in generally dour second-quarter results reported so far, technology is the only sector showing improved third-quarter analyst expectations, mostly because of strong scorecards recently from Facebook Inc (FB.O), Google-parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Texas Instruments Inc (TXN.O) and others. Analysts’ third-quarter expectations for all other sectors have been deteriorating since last year on worries about slower global growth and the strength of the U.S. dollar, according to Thomson Reuters data, though profit growth still is expected in consumer discretionary, materials and other sectors. Earnings across the S&P; 500 are now seen growing just 0.2 percent in the third quarter over the same quarter a year ago, down from an estimate of 2 percent growth a month ago. Technology profits, which this year have been the biggest contributor to S&P; 500 earnings after financials, are now seen growing 3.1 percent in the third quarter, up from the 2.4 percent growth predicted a month ago.  Without the contribution of leaders like Alphabet and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), for example, the entire index might show another quarter of slowing profit growth. Investors have been predicting that S&P; 500 aggregate earnings would start to grow again in the third quarter of this year after starting to shrink in the third quarter of 2015. The second quarter, mostly over, is on track to show a 2.4 percent decline.  Wall Street has been banking on fatter corporate profits to justify pricey valuations following a recent rally that has propelled the S&P; 500 to record highs. Part of the reason for strength in the tech sector may be related to the weight of just a few larger players. In 2015, Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft, Alphabet, IBM (IBM.N) and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) pulled in combined earnings of $125 billion, equivalent to over half of all profits in the sector, according to a Thomson Reuters analysis. “They have just become such powerful, dominant market players that they don’t face quite the pressures of other companies,” said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.  “In the case of Facebook and Google, they continue to just steal share, advertising share, from traditional sources. So they are truly shifting the pie towards them,” he said. All those companies beat Wall Street’s earnings expectations for the June quarter, except for Cisco, which is expected to report its quarterly results on Aug. 17. Its earnings per share beat expectations in at least the past eight quarters, according to Thomson Reuters data. Tech’s improving outlook has been noted on Wall Street, where the tech-heavy Nasdaq has risen 12 percent since its June 27 post-Brexit referendum low. “Tech looks attractive,” said Kristina Hooper, U.S. investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors. “Technology offers better values, especially when you factor in growth estimates.” ",8032016,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-results-tech/big-tech-may-halt-earnings-recession-if-it-delivers-q3-numbers-idUSL1N1AJ120

327,IBM,Investor lawsuits dismissed over IBM's 2014 write-down,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM Corp (IBM.N) on Wednesday won the dismissal of a pair of proposed class action lawsuits filed after the company in 2014 announced it would take a $2.4 billion write-down in connection with selling its semiconductor unit. U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan in a pair of rulings dismissed an investor lawsuit accusing IBM of securities fraud, as well as a lawsuit brought on behalf of participants in a company 401(k) plan. Neither IBM nor lawyers for the lead plaintiff in the investor lawsuit responded immediately to requests for comment.  The lawsuits stemmed from IBM’s Oct. 20, 2014 announcement that it would pay GlobalFoundries Inc $1.5 billion to take over  a money-losing unit that designed and produced microchips. IBM also announced it would take a $2.4 billion write-down on the entire value of assets in the microelectronics unit, as well as $800 million of other unspecified costs. The announcement was accompanied that day by IBM disclosing disappointing third-quarter financial results. Following the announcements, IBM stock dropped more than 17 percent, the plaintiffs said. Investors led by KBC Asset Management NV contended IBM inflated its stock price before selling the unit by carrying the unit’s property, plant and equipment assets on its books at $2.4 billion, when the assets were actually worthless. But Pauley said the lawsuit “fails to raise a strong inference” that the need to write-down the unit was so apparent to IBM before the October 2014 announcement that failure to take an earlier write-down constituted fraud. The judge similarly granted IBM’s motion to dismiss a lawsuit by plaintiffs Larry Jander and Richard Waksman on behalf of participants in IBM’s 401(k) Plus Plan, though he said the could seek to file an amended complaint. Sam Bonderoff, the plaintiffs’ lawyer, said while he was disappointed by the ruling, “we are gratified that it did so without prejudice, giving us leave to file an amended complaint, which we intend to do.” The cases in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, are International Association of Heat and Frost Insulators and Asbestos Workers Local #6 Pension Fund v.

Dr. Shen Xiaowei, director of IBM Research-China and chief technology officer of IBM Great China Group said the company also is partnering with the Hyperledger Project to build a block chain platform and help clients develop more uses for industry.  Hyperledger is a cross-industry collaboration started in December by the Linux Foundation to support block chain-based applications designed to support global business transactions, including major technological, financial, and supply chain companies.

337,IBM,Banks adopting blockchain 'dramatically faster' than expected: IBM,"LONDON (Reuters) - Banks and other financial institutions are adopting blockchain technology “dramatically faster” than initially expected, with 15 percent of top global banks intending to roll out full-scale, commercial blockchain products in 2017, IBM said on Wednesday.  The technology company said 65 percent of banks expected to have blockchain projects in production in three years’ time, with larger banks - those with more than 100,000 employees - leading the charge.   IBM, whose findings were based on a survey of 200 banks, said the areas most commonly identified by lenders as ripe for blockchain-based innovation were clearing and settlement, wholesale payments, equity and debt issuance and reference data. Blockchain, which originates from digital currency bitcoin, works as an electronic transaction-processing and record-keeping system that allows all parties to track information through a secure network, with no need for third-party verification.  But while almost every major bank has said it is looking into the technology, widespread financial adoption has been thought to be at least 5 to 10 years away. Consultancy Oliver Wyman said in a report in February it would take at least a decade for blockchain to overhaul core parts of the financial industry.   “The industry is hurtling toward blockchain adoption far faster than many expected,” IBM said in its report. “2017 looks to be the year banking on blockchains shifts from zero to sixty.”  The company also conducted a separate survey of 200 other global financial markets institutions, 14 percent of which intended to implement commercial blockchain products in 2017.  “First movers are setting business standards and creating new models that will be used by future adopters of blockchain technology,” said IBM Banking and Financial Markets general manager Likhit Wagle.  “These early adopters are better able to anticipate disruption, fighting off new competitors along the way.” Microsoft and Bank of America Merrill Lynch said on Tuesday they had teamed up on a new project using blockchain in trade finance, aiming to create a framework that could eventually be sold to other businesses.      IBM also said it had announced several new blockchain ventures at this week’s Sibos financial conference in Geneva, including a project with currency settlement system CLS to develop a new payment netting service.

338,IBM,UPDATE 1-Apple deepens enterprise push with Deloitte partnership,"(Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Deloitte LLP announced a partnership on Wednesday in which the consultant will open a new practice to help corporate clients work with Apple products, the tech firm’s latest attempt to boost enterprise sales as its key product, the iPhone, shows signs of maturation. More than 5,000 Deloitte advisers will be included in the Apple initiative, the companies said. The consulting firm also launched EnterpriseNext, a program aimed at helping clients make better use of Apple products and services. Apple has announced a steady stream of enterprise partnerships in recent years as it aims to draw more revenue from a market that some say it has traditionally overlooked.  A partnership struck with IBM in 2014 signaled Apple’s intentions of getting more serious about corporate clients, or enterprise, and deals with Cisco and SAP have followed. The deal with Deloitte will ensure that Apple is top of mind as companies think strategically about their practices, Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an interview.  “What’s needed now is more of a focus on transforming the enterprise and helping businesses identify which areas have the highest either return on investment or highest impact on customer satisfaction,” Cook said. “Deloitte is well positioned for this.” As part of the EnterpriseNext program, customers can meet with designers and engineers who specialize in Apple’s operating system.  “The intent there is to, in one location, bring the best engineers, the best products and the best thinkers to try and address clients’ problems,” Punit Renjen, CEO of Deloitte Global, said in an interview. Apple faces mounting pressure to find new streams of revenue after sales of the iPhone, which drives more than half of its revenue, declined for the first time this year.  The tech giant appears to have concluded that the quickest way to progress in enterprise is to partner with companies rooted in the space, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. Cook said in 2015 that Apple’s enterprise business had reached $25 billion in annual revenue. He declined to provide a new figure on Wednesday but stressed the company is gaining ground.  “The momentum is significant, and we see this as a very important growth vector,” he said.

343,IBM,IBM sees tipping point at hand for industrial Internet," (This October 3 story was corrected to show growth figure excludes acquisitions in final paragraph) By Eric Auchard FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Plugging computer sensors into factories, cars, shops and offices to help them operate more smartly on the industrial Internet, or so-called Internet of Things (IoT), is moving beyond prototypes into the mass market, IBM said on Monday. The computer services and software company, which has struggled with flagging growth in its traditional business in recent years, said its industrial Internet business has surged to 6,000 paying customers from 4,000 at the end of 2015. The IoT, which gives many billions of machine parts the capability to send and receive data, is vital to IBM’s turnaround as it has refocused on areas that promise profitable growth such as analytics, security and cloud services.    That a tipping point may now be being reached for the industrial Internet is borne out by a recent global survey of 4,500 corporate decision-makers in 27 countries by market research firm IDC that found the market is moving beyond proof of concept projects to full-scale project deployments. “We think 2019 is going to be that inflection curve where the market really takes off,” IDC IoT analyst Vernon Turner said of how business cases proven over the next two years will set the stage for IoT to hit the mainstream.     Nearly a third of corporate customers in the IDC survey said they have launched IoT projects, while another 42 percent said they plan to do so in the next 12 months. To meet rising demand, IBM said it plans to hire 1,000 people over the next few years at its new global IoT headquarters in Munich, executives said.  That is part of a broader move by IBM to hire 25,000 new employees in growth areas globally, while cutting jobs and costs in slower growing hardware and services businesses. “There was so much tire-kicking a year ago. Now you are seeing adopters in every single industry actually building solutions,” IBM’s vice president in charge of IoT platforms Bret Greenstein said in an interview. IBM will announce on Tuesday a new strategic partnership with German industrial ball bearing giant Schaeffler (SHA_p.DE)  to supply it with data analytics, cloud services and consulting, in a deal where both firms invest and jointly market services. The deal covers areas ranging from product development to manufacturing to preventive maintenance once cars, trains, wind turbines and other moving parts are sold. IBM’s global head of IoT business Harriet Green said she has four to five big deals in the pipeline with Asian firms involved in manufacturing and robotics.    IBM also said it signed up new clients such as Dutch drone maker Aerialtronics to use IoT for inspecting oil rigs, power lines, cellphone towers and city traffic patterns. So far, however, high-growth areas - “strategic imperatives” in IBM parlance - have failed to offset declines its overall business has seen for the last five years.      In its latest reported quarter, IBM’s “strategic imperative” businesses, which include IoT, slowed to only 7 percent growth, excluding acquisitions, while core businesses in services and hardware fell 14 percent year-on-year, Bernstein Research calculates.

358,IBM,"GM's OnStar, IBM's Watson combine to market brands to drivers","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - General Motors Co  and International Business Machines Corp  on Tuesday said they would combine IBM’s artificial intelligence software Watson with the carmaker’s OnStar system in order to market services to drivers in their vehicles.  The feature, called OnStar Go, is set to debut early next year in more than two million GM vehicles with 4G service, IBM and GM said in a joint statement. IBM’s Watson, which beat two previous winners of the quiz show “Jeopardy!” in 2011, will sift through data in order to recognize a driver’s habits, allowing third-party marketers to deliver targeted offers, whether nearby coffee shops, reminders about shopping-list items, or paying for fuel from their dashboards. Carmakers have been adding connected services into their vehicles to duplicate the convenience of smartphones, which can suggest nearby restaurant offers, or point the way to a gas station.  Data generated from connected vehicles is valuable to automakers, although some consumers have been wary of privacy and data security issues. Drivers will have to opt in to the service, the companies said. Automakers are trying to fend off in-vehicle competition from Alphabet Inc’s  Google and Apple Inc , whose Android Auto and CarPlay services connect entertainment and navigation on the driver’s smartphone to the vehicle’s dashboard. ExxonMobil, MasterCard and parking spot finder Parkopedia are among the first brands to join the platform, IBM and GM said.

It creates a “golden record” of any given set of data that is automatically replicated for all parties in a secure network, eliminating any need for third-party verification. Financial services companies around the world have been focusing on developing blockchain technology, with advocates saying it has the potential to save billions of dollars in costs and speed up transaction times. The technology will be used to certify original documents by using IBM’s Hyperledger infrastructure. At the initial stage, a system called OriginCert API is used to certify letters of guarantee (LG), which helps simplify and speed up the LG issuance process for customers, according to a joint statement.

367,IBM,Warren Buffett's Berkshire makes surprise U.S. airline bet,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Monday said it has bought shares in the four biggest U.S. airlines: American Airlines Group Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc, Southwest Airlines Co and United Continental Holdings Inc. The investments mark an unexpected reversal for Berkshire, which has avoided the airline sector for nearly two decades after a troubled investment in the former US Air Group, a forerunner to American. They also expand Berkshire’s bet on the U.S. economy, and in particular transportation. Berkshire already owns the BNSF railroad and the NetJets luxury plane unit, and in January paid $32.1 billion for aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts. According to a regulatory filing, Berkshire as of Sept. 30 owned 21.8 million American shares worth $797 million, 6.3 million Delta shares worth $249.3 million, and 4.5 million United shares worth $237.8 million. Buffett told CNBC television that Berkshire later invested in Southwest, and was disclosing that stake to avoid misleading investors into believing he was avoiding the carrier. It is unclear whether Buffett or one of his deputies, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, invested in the airlines. Shares often rise when investors perceive that Berkshire has given them its imprimatur. Buffett usually handles larger Berkshire investments such as Kraft Heinz Co, Wells Fargo & Co, Coca-Cola Co and International Business Machines Corp. His Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also owns roughly 90 companies such as BNSF, Geico car insurance and Dairy Queen ice cream. The airline investments are “really important for investor confidence” in that sector, said Adam Hackel, an airline analyst at Imperial Capital LLC in New York. Berkshire did not respond to requests for comment. In after-hours trading, American shares rose 3.8 percent, Delta 3.4 percent, Southwest 3.3 percent and United 2.2 percent. U.S. airlines have benefited in recent years from lower fuel costs, labor peace, higher fees from checked bags and other once-free services, and reduced competition through mergers. Such factors helped the four largest U.S. carriers post a record $21.7 billion combined profit in 2015, and command more than two-thirds of the domestic market. Berkshire had ventured into airlines in 1989 when Buffett bought $358 million of USAir preferred stock, but he quickly regretted that investment. In 1997, he told Berkshire shareholders he had misjudged how USAir would “increasingly feel the effects of an unregulated, fiercely-competitive market whereas its cost structure was a holdover from the days when regulation protected profits.” Eleven years later, Buffett felt no better, calling airlines a capital-intensive business that earned little or no money. “A durable competitive advantage has proven elusive ever since the days of the Wright Brothers,” he wrote in his February 2008 shareholder letter. “Indeed, if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down.” Buffett nonetheless admitted to having sold the USAir stock, in 1998, at a “hefty gain.” Orville Wright died in 1948, more than 44 years after he and his brother Wilbur flew their plane at Kitty Hawk, N.C. American and Delta said they welcomed Berkshire as an investor, and American said it “reinforces our view that our industry has fundamentally changed in a profound and lasting way.” Southwest declined to comment. United had no immediate comment. Berkshire on Monday also disclosed other portfolio changes. It slashed its stake in Wal-Mart Stores Inc by roughly two-thirds to 13 million shares. Berkshire had begun paring its stake in the world’s largest retailer earlier this year, after more than a decade of ownership. Separately, Berkshire reduced its stake in pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc, and exited an investment in Canadian oil and gas producer Suncor Energy Inc.

369,IBM,"IGM Financial, GWL set to buy Montreal office towers -sources","MONTREAL (Reuters) - Investors Group and GWL Realty Advisors are set to buy two Montreal office buildings from Germany’s KanAm Grund Group for around C$415 million ($308.99 million), though the transaction has not been finalized, two sources familiar with the deal said. Investors Group is part of IGM Financial Inc (IGM.TO) while GWL is part of Great-West Lifeco Inc. (GWO.TO) Power Financial Corp (PWF.TO) is the controlling shareholder of both companies. Power Corp of Canada (POW.TO) in turn controls Power Financial. The buildings are expected to be sold at a low capitalization rate for the Montreal market, indicating that demand for high-quality office buildings is spilling over from Toronto and Vancouver. The potential sale of the office towers was reported on Friday by Reuters. Power Corp spokesman Stephane Lemay referred a reporter’s query directly to Winnipeg-based Investors Group which declined to comment. GWL Realty in Toronto and KanAm could not immediately be reached for comment. The deal should close before year’s end, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because terms of the transaction have not been made public. The downtown buildings are expected to be sold at a capitalization rate of just over 5 percent, which is indicative of a premium asset, said the sources. Capitalization rates are calculated by dividing an asset’s net operating income by its market price. According to recent data from Colliers International, Montreal cap rates for Class A buildings range from 5.50 percent to 6.25 percent. “It (a 5 cap) is unusual for the city,” said a third source familiar with both the deal and the Montreal commercial real estate market, who declined to comment because the transaction is not yet public. According to data from CBRE Ltd, Montreal’s third quarter downtown vacancy rate was 11 percent, compared with 10.6 percent for downtown markets in Canada as a whole. KanAm, which owns real estate assets in Europe, North America and Australia, acquired the buildings at 1350-1360 René-Lévesque West, in 2007 and 2008.  The nearly 1 million square-foot property is managed by Canderel Inc, a Canadian real estate developer. Tenants include IT services providers CGI Group, Computer Sciences Canada, IBM and TD Bank, according to its website. Real estate services firm JLL, which is selling the properties, declined to comment.

IBM was the lead contractor for the five-yearly Aug. 9 household survey by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) that went offline the day after four distributed denial of service attacks that were caused by the website being flooded with clicks. “This was not a particularly clever attack or some great international assault on the census,” Turnbull told Melbourne’s 3AW radio on Friday. “IBM had a contract to deal with it and they failed,” he said. The style of the attack, which occurred through a router in Singapore, was “common” and “utterly foreseeable,” Turnbull said, although it was not clear who was responsible for it. An IBM spokeswoman declined to comment on Friday, but the company apologized last month to an upper house Senate inquiry over the outage, while also saying that the router was set up by a subcontractor, Nextgen Networks Pty Ltd. IBM has since reached a confidential settlement with Australia for its role in the breach, Australia’s minister responsible for the census, Michael McCormack, said in a statement. The Senate inquiry heard that IBM failed to test the Singapore router properly, which was wrongly configured and became overloaded, causing the website shutdown. The inquiry’s report, released on Thursday, also criticized the ABS for favoring IBM during the tender process. “There used to be a saying: ‘No-one got fired for buying IBM’,” Turnbull said. “I can assure you the lessons will be very carefully learned,” he said.

376,IBM,IBM revenue fall dims upbeat profit forecast,"(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp reported its 19th straight quarter of declining revenue, but forecast full-year earnings above Wall Street estimates due to growth in newer areas such as cloud-based services and analytics. However, investments to drive growth in the cloud business and the company’s shift to a subscription-based as-a-service model hit its operating gross margin by 1.8 percentage points to 51 percent in the fourth quarter. IBM’s shares were down 2.5 percent at $162.70 after rising briefly in extended trading. CFRA Research analyst David Holt said the company’s results still raised questions as to when revenue would grow. “The 800-pound gorilla in the room is the overall inflection point towards revenue growth. That’s the moving target,” Holt said. IBM forecast adjusted earnings of at least $13.80 per share for fiscal 2017, beating the average analyst estimate of $13.74, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Chief Executive Gini Rometty’s transition efforts have shown revenue growth across some areas in recent quarters, with newer businesses driving the efforts. Rometty has also been supportive of President-elect Donald  Trump’s tax reform proposal. The proposal would allow companies in the United States to reinvest in training and educational programs for their employees, Rometty wrote in a letter to Trump in November. “When you have an administration that is pro-export ... we can see a benefit from that, and if we get fundamental tax reform, that could, on balance, help us as well,” Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter told Reuters on Thursday. Revenue from “strategic imperatives”, which includes cloud and mobile computing, data analytics, social and security software, rose 11 percent to $9.5 billion in the fourth quarter, from a year earlier.

380,IBM,US STOCKS-U.S. stocks set to open slightly lower,"(Adds details, comments, updates prices) * Trump to make inaugural speech on Friday * Dollar up, but gold also in positive territory * Netflix rises as subscriber numbers blow past expectations * Futures down: Dow 24 pts, S&P; 2.5 pts, Nasdaq 3.75 pts By Yashaswini Swamynathan Jan 19 (Reuters) - Wall Street looked set to open slightly lower on Thursday, with investors seemingly wary of taking on risk ahead of Donald Trump’s swearing-in as U.S. president on Friday. After having driven Wall Street to record highs in a post-election rally, investors are on the sidelines as they await Trump’s inaugural speech to get a steer on his policies. Markets are also eyeing a speech by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed lower for the fourth straight session on Wednesday, its longest losing streak since early October, as energy stocks were hit by falling oil prices. “Investors’ concerns on Trump delivering his campaign promises is probably the real ‘Fear Factor’,” Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial wrote in a note. Dow e-minis were down 24 points, or 0.12 percent at 8:30 a.m. ET (1330 GMT), with 13,933 contracts changing hands. S&P; 500 e-minis were down 2.5 points, or 0.11 percent, with 86,650 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 3.75 points, or 0.07 percent, on volume of 17,569 contracts. With the fourth-quarter earnings season picking up pace, investors will focus on Dow components IBM and American Express, which are scheduled to report results after market close. In an appearance on Wednesday, Yellen said the U.S. economy was getting closer to running on its own, but soothed some nerves by adding that it made sense to raise interest rates gradually. Yellen is expected to speak on monetary policy at Stanford University at 8:00 p.m. ET. Investors have been worried that Trump’s pro-growth policy proposals may boost inflation, forcing the central bank to increase the pace of rate hikes. Yellen’s comments indicated that the plan to raise rates three times this year is not “farfetched”, Cardillo said. A report on jobless claims showed that 234,000 Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, far fewer than 254,000 that economists expected. Stocks moving premarket included Netflix that was up 6.8 percent at $142.32 after the streaming video provider said it added far more subscribers in its latest quarter than what was expected. Tesla rose 3.9 percent to $247.75 after Panasonic  said it aimed to extend its partnership with the electric carmaker into self-driving technology. Mallinckrodt was up 4.7 percent at $48.70 after agreeing to pay $400 million to settle a U.S. probe on drug pricing.

381,IBM,Fitch: IBM's Ratings Unaffected by Finance Business Reorganization,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 20 (Fitch) The ratings for International Business Machines  Corporation (IBM), including its 'A+/F1' Long- and Short-Term Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs), are unaffected by the company's reorganization of its financing  business, according to Fitch Ratings. Fitch believes IBM's core industrial and  financing businesses remain co-dependent and that the financing business enables  higher marginal sales than would third-party financing providers, due to  meaningfully greater customer intimacy. Fitch does not expect IBM's financing  mission to change as a result of the reorganization, and clearer delineation by  geography will enhance disclosure granularity, particularly since the financing  business will file standalone financial statements with the Securities and  Exchange Commission (SEC). Fitch will maintain a maximum gearing ratio of 7:1 at the financing unit in  accordance with its Criteria for Rating Non-Financial Corporates published Sept.  27, 2016, despite IBM's financing unit's intention to increase gearing to 9:1  from 7:1. Fitch has always assigned any debt on IBM's balance sheet not  associated with the financing unit to IBM's core industrial business and  subtracted Global Financing segment profitability from IBM's consolidated  operating EBITDA to arrive at Core Leverage (Total Debt less Financing Debt to  Operating EBITDA less Global Financing Profitability).  Therefore, Fitch will assign any debt associated with the financing business in  excess of the 7:1 gearing ratio (or potentially lower, depending upon Fitch's  regular evaluation of the financing business' funding and liquidity and asset  quality) to the core business, resulting in structurally higher core leverage  were financing debt to increase. Fitch estimates core leverage for fiscal 2016  was 1x and would be only negligibly higher (less than 0.1x) even if the  financing business was geared at 9:1. Fitch's negative rating sensitivities  contemplate potential negative rating actions should Fitch expect core leverage  to remain above 1.25x, currently providing IBM headroom for modest incremental  debt. Fitch also believes earnings results for the core IBM businesses do not impact  the current ratings or Negative Rating Outlook. While year-over-year revenue  declined again in the fourth quarter of 2016, Fitch continues to expect revenue  will stabilize and resume positive constant currency organic growth in the near  to intermediate term. Revenue excluding the Systems and Global Financing  segments, which respectively represented 10% and 2% of total external revenue,  was flat for the year including acquisitions but before currency-related  headwinds. Revenue from the company's strategic imperatives ended 2016  representing 41% of total revenue, well ahead of the company's 40% target for  year-end 2018, in part due to faster than anticipated declines in a number of  legacy businesses. Nonetheless, revenue from IBM's strategic imperatives should  continue growing by double digit rates over at least the near term. Fitch's Negative Outlook for IBM continues to focus on profitability, which was  flat year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2016, largely due to increased  intellectual property and customer development income and slightly lower  operating expenses. Gross profit margins continue contracting, particularly for  growth segments such as Cognitive Solutions and Technology Services & Cloud  Platforms, although gross profit margins could recover as recent acquisitions  and new businesses scale over time. Fitch defined free cash flow (FCF), which  includes dividends, declined 20% in 2016 to $6.1 billion after backing out $1.2  billion of proceeds from changes in Global Financing Receivables. FCF could  stabilize near the current level with improved execution in 2017. IBM announced it will reorganize the financing business as a wholly-owned  subsidiary, IBM Credit LLC. In time, the new subsidiary will meet its funding  requirements by issuing debt directly to the market, beginning later in 2017.  The financing business will increase its leverage to 9:1 from 7:1, although  Fitch will continue evaluating the financing business at a maximum of 7:1. The  Global Financing segment, as reported by IBM, remains unchanged and will  continue to include the client and commercial financing business, as well as the  hardware remanufacturing and remarketing business. Fitch currently rates International Business Machines Corporation as follows: --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A+'; --Senior unsecured RCF 'A+'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A+'; --Short-Term IDR 'F1'; --Commercial paper 'F1'. The Rating Outlook is Negative.

382,IBM,Austrian software firm raises $165 million to take on HPE and IBM in testing,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A little-known Austrian software company is looking to snatch business from established players HP Enterprise (HPE) and IBM in the market for software testing tools, after raising $165 million from a U.S. private equity firm.     Tricentis, founded in Vienna in 2009 and now headquartered in the Silicon Valley town of Los Altos, has emerged as a leader in automating how big businesses test and deploy software, despite having raised little outside funding previously.     On Monday, the company said it will receive $165 million in financing from Insight Venture Partners, a software-focused private equity firm based in New York.      Previously, Tricentis relied on “bootstrap” funding from its own operations and had taken only one outside financing round, a $9 million early-stage investment from Frankfurt-based venture firm Viewpoint, now part of Kennet Partners, in 2012.      As part its investment, Insight bought out Kennet’s stake in Tricentis and is now its sole outside shareholder. Pacific Crest Securities acted as financial advisor to Tricentis, it said.     The company, which counts 120 employees in Vienna, 25 in the United States and roughly another 120 employees around the world, is looking to use its new financial backing to dramatically boost its sales efforts in the U.S. market, where it employed just five sales people, CEO Sandeep Johri said.     “We can take Tricentis into becoming a global company,” Johri told Reuters. “We have all the ingredients to really scale it.”      The company currently counts more than 400 corporate and government customers concentrated in Central Europe, the United States, Australia and India. They include Allianz, BMW, Starbucks, Deutsche Bank, Orange, Toyota and UBS.     Tricentis ranks as the leader in software test automation by research firms Gartner and Forrester, a market where it has made in-roads against established players HPE, IBM, and a variety of start-ups by taking a highly automated approach to testing in contrast to older script-based approaches of rivals, Johri said.     Demand for Tricentis tools is being propelled by the wider shift to “agile” programing techniques where software developers at big companies rely on small, informal teams and rapid development cycles to deliver software more efficiently.     Broadly speaking, the global software testing market is estimated to generate $34 billion in 2017, according to market research firm Nelson Hall. Companies such as HPE and IBM hold big chunks of this market with software testing lines that boast broad product offerings, but also date back up to 20 years.  By focusing on automating up to 90 percent of the work of software testing, Johri said Tricentis can take market share from more manual testing approaches of rivals, in what he says is a multi-billion-dollar slice of the software testing market.

The initiative will provide real-time information about the state of goods and the status of their shipment to Dubai’s customs and trade agencies and companies involved in the trade process, IBM said. Dubai, which registered 647 billion dirhams ($176 billion) of non-oil trade in the first half of 2016, has cemented itself as one of the largest re-export centers for goods flowing between Asia and the Middle East and Africa.  IBM said it was also working with companies including du, a United Arab Emirates-based telecommunications firm, Dubai’s largest bank Emirates NBD, Spanish lender Banco Santander, Dubai-based logistics firm Aramex and an unidentified airline on the scheme. Blockchain, which originates from digital currency bitcoin, works as an electronic transaction processing and record keeping system that allows all parties to track information through a secure network, with no need for third-party verification. Proponents think it could make transactions faster and safer, and have a wide range of applications.

396,IBM,Northern Trust uses blockchain for private equity record-keeping,"NEW YORK, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Northern Trust Corp has deployed a new blockchain-based system built with International Business Machines Corp  to record information on transactions involving private equity funds, in one of the first commercial deployments of the nascent technology. The program is currently being used to manage the administration of a private equity fund run by Switzerland-based asset manager Unigestion, Northern Trust and IBM said on Wednesday. The new blockchain system records documents and information connected to transactions involving the fund, such as investments by limited partners, a process which is currently highly manual.  Other than providing a central record for fund managers, investors and administrators, the program also allows regulators to access the information when required. Blockchain, which first emerged as the system underpinning cryptocurrency bitcoin, is an immutable shared ledger of transactions that is maintained by a network of computers, rather than a centralized authority. As it creates a shared golden source of data it can reduce errors and the need for reconciliation. Financial institutions have been ramping up their investment in blockchain, also known as distributed ledger technology, in the hopes that it can help make some of their processes more efficient and cheaper to manage. The new system, built using blockchain code from the Linux Foundation-led Hyperledger project, could provide greater transparency, efficiency and security to an asset class that has remained largely paper-based, Northern Trust and IBM executives told Reuters. “We decided to focus on the private equity market because the marketplace is very manual today,” said Peter Cherecwich, president of corporate and institutional services, at Northern Trust. “Benefits should include a reduction in cost.” The Chicago-based asset management and fund administration company plans to roll out the platform to other clients selectively, it said. While financial firms have announced numerous blockchain experiments over the past year, the vast majority still have to move into real implementations, leading skeptics to question whether the technology’s potential has been over-hyped. Private equity was an ideal market for early blockchain adoption because it involved lower volumes of transactions than other asset classes but would benefit from more automation, Northern Trust and IBM executives said.

Lloyds Trade Union said in a newsletter to staff on Sunday that the transferred employees would be kept on for a year, but most would lose their jobs after four years.  The union said the move could weaken the bank’s “existing security controls” and impact on the confidentiality of customer data.  Chief Executive Officer Antonio Horta-Osório is looking to shed thousands of jobs to streamline the business, support dividend payments and boost the share price as the government prepares to sell down its remaining stake in the bank this year. Lloyds said in a statement that it does not comment on speculation and, if any decisions are made, they are communicated to colleagues first.  The planned moves were first reported by the Financial Times.   In January, Lloyds was hit with a cyber attack that caused intermittent outages to customers of its personal banking websites, a source familiar with the matter said at the time as banks continue to look at ways to improve online security after a series of incidents over the past few years.

406,IBM,IBM launches enterprise-ready blockchain service,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp  has launched a service that will allow businesses to build applications on its cloud using blockchain code from the Hyperledger Project, the cross-industry group led by the Linux Foundation. The U.S. technology company said on Monday its new product called IBM Blockchain was the first service for developers to build enterprise-grade technology using Hyperledger Fabric, the first code set to be released by the open source group. The Fabric blockchain can process more than 1,000 transactions per second and has the necessary features to be used by large enterprises to build their applications, IBM said. It added it was working with technology company SecureKey Technologies and a group of Canadian banks to build a digital identity network using its new blockchain services. The network, set for launch later this year, is aimed at making it easier for consumers to prove their identities when accessing services such as new bank accounts, driver’s licenses or utilities. Banks involved include Bank of Montreal, Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Toronto-Dominion Bank. Blockchain, which emerged as the system running cryptocurrency bitcoin, is a digital shared record of transactions that is maintained by a network of computers on the internet, without the need of a centralized authority. Big businesses, including many of the world’s largest banks, have been increasing their investment in the technology in hopes it can help them reduce the complexity and costs of some of their most burdensome processes, such as the settlement of securities or international payments. Technology companies and professional services firms have also been ramping up their investment in blockchain, as they race to capture the nascent market. IBM has been one of the most aggressive large technology companies on blockchain and has several large clients developing applications with the technology, including Northern Trust Corp , Wal-Mart Stores Inc and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation.

The new division, known as HorizonX, invested in Upskill, a Washington, D.C.-based software company that uses Google Glass-type eye wear to help assembly workers complete complex tasks such as creating wiring bundles for Boeing jetliners. It also invested in Zunum Aero, a Seattle-area company that is working on electric-hybrid aircraft aimed at bringing down the cost of flying to regional airports. Zunum also received funding from JetBlue Technology Ventures, a unit of the New York-based JetBlue Airways Corp. Boeing declined to specify the investment amounts. “But this initiative represents a multi-year commitment by Boeing to spend tens of millions of dollars a year to advance innovation and to supplement our research and development efforts,” spokesman Chaz Bickers said. “While the levels of investment generally are not material to Boeing’s financials, they generally will be to our target investments.” Steve Nordlund, former vice president of strategy for Boeing’s defense, space and security business, will head HorizonX. Nordlund was involved in launching drone-maker Insitu Inc, which Boeing acquired in 2008. He also has worked in sales at IBM and was chief information officer at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.

413,IBM,"IBM posts first revenue miss in five quarters, shares tumble","(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) reported a bigger-than-expected decline in revenue for the first time in five quarters due to weak demand in its IT services business, a sign that the company’s turnaround could take longer than expected. Shares of IBM, whose revenue has now fallen for 20 quarters in a row, tumbled 4.7 percent to $162 in trading after the bell on Tuesday. At current levels, the stock is set to more than erase its roughly 2.5 percent gain this year. With demand for its legacy hardware and software businesses stagnating, IBM has been shifting towards cloud-based services, security software, data analytics and artificial intelligence such as its supercomputer Watson, which once defeated human contestants in the quiz show Jeopardy. These “strategic imperatives”, spread across IBM’s various businesses, continued to grow in the first quarter, but failed to offset weakness in the company’s core operations, especially at the technology services and cloud platforms business. IBM could not close some large deals in that business, which is its largest, while a couple of large clients took their operations in-house, Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter said on a conference call. As a result, IBM’s overall revenue decline increased to 2.8 percent in the first quarter from 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter, and widely missed analysts’ expectation of a 1.6 percent drop. “I think the frustration lies with the overall miss on revenue,” Edward Jones analyst Bill Kreher said. “The Street has given IBM some credit over the last year that the transition is taking shape, so I think that’s where the risk lies ... execution needs to be strong.” IBM’s revenue of $18.16 billion in the first quarter missed analysts’ estimate of $18.39 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue in the technology services and cloud platforms business dropped 2.5 percent to $8.2 billion. The business accounted for about 45 percent of total revenue. The company said gross profit margin fell in all five of its reporting units. Overall adjusted gross margin of 44.5 percent missed analysts’ estimates of 47.7 percent. However, “strategic imperatives” revenue growth accelerated to 12 percent in the first quarter from 11 percent in the fourth. Revenue from “strategic imperatives” was $7.8 billion in the latest quarter, accounting for 42 percent of total revenue, up from 37 percent a year earlier. “ ... The company at some point will see the newer businesses over take legacy, but it appears it’s going to take a little bit longer than previously believed,” Kreher said.

The advance in financials was underpinned by a 2.6 percent jump in shares of Morgan Stanley, which reported a surge in quarterly profit. Shares of other big U.S. banks rose in tandem. Morgan Stanley’s solid results provided some succor to investors stung by weak results at chief rival Goldman Sachs a day earlier. IBM sank nearly 6 percent to $16.06 after the company reported a bigger-than-expected decline in revenue for the first time in five quarters. The stock was the biggest drag on the Dow and the S&P.; “It’s really a battle between geopolitical headlines and earnings right now, and for the most part earnings seem to be winning in the short term,” said Jeff Zipper, managing director of investments at the Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank in Palm Beach Florida. Mounting tension between North Korea and the United States and political uncertainty in Europe ahead of the French presidential elections had kept safe-havens such as gold and U.S. Treasuries in demand in the past weeks. At 11:01 a.m. ET (1501 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 23.46 points, or 0.11 percent, at 20,499.82, the S&P; 500 was up 6.27 points, or 0.27 percent, at 2,348.46 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 35.50 points, or 0.61 percent, at 5,884.97. With Wall Street near record levels and worries over President Donald Trump’s ability to carry out his pro-growth promises, investors are hoping first-quarter earnings will be strong enough to justify pricey market valuations. So far, the results have been promising. Of the 45 S&P; 500 companies that have released results, nearly 76 percent have topped earnings estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Overall profits of S&P; 500 companies are estimated to have risen 10.7 percent in the quarter - the best since 2011. Eight of the 11 major S&P; 500 sectors were higher. Utilities, real estate and consumer staples, which have outperformed the broader index since Monday, were down. Facebook was up 1.3 percent and provided the biggest boost to the S&P; and the Nasdaq. Intuitive Surgical was up 7.3 percent at $814.49 after the company reported higher-than-expected first-quarter revenue and profit. American Express, eBay and Qualcomm are scheduled to report results after the market closes. In economic data, the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, which will give a glimpse into economic conditions across the United States, is due at 2:00 p.m. ET (1800 GMT). Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,753 to 997. On the Nasdaq, 1,838 issues rose and 766 fell.

419,IBM,IBM's cloud provides little silver lining,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - IBM’s cloud provides little silver lining. Big Blue fell short of investor expectations and reported its 20th consecutive quarter of falling revenue. Boss Ginni Rometty keeps talking up artificial intelligence and remote servers and services. Competition, however, may prove too formidable. All the financial engineering in the world – and IBM has engaged in a lot of it over the past decade by selling businesses and borrowing to buy back stock – can’t hide that the $160 billion company has been caught short by big shifts in technology. The switch to cloud computing and programs has curbed demand for its consultants, hardware and traditional software.  It has survived mass extinctions before, but there’s mounting skepticism it can thrive in the current climate. Over the past five years, the company’s shares have fallen 16 percent compared to a 68 percent increase for the S&P; 500 Index. The future for IBM resides in what it calls “Strategic Imperatives.” These initiatives, which include the AI initiative Watson and cloud operations, grew 12 percent over the past year and now account for more than 40 percent of total revenue. Ongoing opacity makes it hard to say exactly what it means, though. IBM doesn’t break out Watson’s figures, for example, because it says it’s a “golden thread” weaving throughout the company. The Cognitive Solutions arm in which Watson is housed only grew 2 percent over the past year. All other divisions shrank. The outlines of IBM’s cloud business are similarly misty. It generated $14.6 billion of revenue – and the services parts of it are expanding at nearly a 60 percent annual clip. An “exit run rate” the company provides for this business, however, is fuzzy, and it’s also hard to discern if it’s additional revenue. By comparison, Amazon Web Services, which is widely considered the industry leader, reported $12.2 billion of sales.  Google and Microsoft also are gunning hard to run the data centers and applications needed by companies big and small. The result is brutal price and technological competition. There’s no clear sign yet that IBM can keep up.",4192017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ibm-results-breakingviews/ibms-cloud-provides-little-silver-lining-idUSKBN17L1J3
420,IBM,"China investors chase ""Nifty 50"" as love affair with small caps sours","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s stock investors are chasing up the country’s version of the “Nifty 50” index as their love affair with trendy small caps fades amid a regulatory crackdown on speculation and concerns that the economy may lose momentum later in the year. The shift in investor preference has also been fueled by a desire for more stable returns, and a burst in supply of listed start-ups favored by smaller punters seeking quick gains. The term “Nifty 50” originally referred to a group of 50 U.S. stocks favored by institutional investors in the 1960s and 1970s, including stalwarts like General Electric, Coca-Cola, and IBM, once known as “one-decision” stocks investors could buy and hold forever. Now Chinese investors are piling into their approximate counterparts such as home appliance maker Gree Electric (000651.SZ) and spirit maker Kweichow Moutai (600519.SS). Despite recent market weakness, Gree has gained some 38 percent this year and hit record highs this week, while Kweichow Moutai became the world’s biggest liquor maker by market capitalization, dethroning British distiller Diageo Plc (DGE.L). Big cap stocks have always had a stable and loyal following among institutional investors in China, but have lacked the magnetism of small caps in a country where the retail investing culture is imbued with a high appetite for risk. “The upward trend for blue-chips like Moutai is not yet over,” Eastmoney Securities strategist Zhang Jiadai said, citing Moutai’s generous dividend payouts and “modest” valuation, at roughly 24 times forward earnings. The brokerage's blue-chip Eastmoney Nifty 50 Index has gained over 5 percent so far this year, outperforming the market benchmark Shanghai Composite .SSEC, which is up roughly 2 percent. Meanwhile, investors are dumping small caps, with the growth board ChiNext  down nearly 6 percent. Zhang predicted that bearish trend “will last for a long time,” potentially halving the index’s valuations from the current level.  Such divergence underscores a dramatic reversal from Chinese investors’ strong preference for small-caps over blue-chips since 2009, creating huge valuation gaps. Even after this year’s sharp correction, ChiNext still trades at an earnings multiple of roughly 50, while the SME board is around 40. In contrast, the SSE50 Index .SSE50, another gauge that some liken to China's ""Nifty 50"", trades at price/earnings ratio under 10. Interest in small caps is quickly waning as regulators have restricted reckless fundraising, blocked “blind” acquisitions and vowed to “brandish the sword” against speculation. “There had been a lot of speculative interest in small-caps, because high valuations allowed them to raise money cheaply to fund acquisitions and thus maintain rapid growth,” said Zhou Liang, fund manager at Minority Asset Management Co. “Once they can no longer keep playing this game, they reveal their true features,” Zhou said, adding he would not be surprised to see the average valuation of ChiNext shares halve over the next two to three years.  In addition, regulators are loosening the tap on initial public offerings (IPOs), flooding the market with newly-listed start-ups and this depressing valuation of small caps in general.  Fund manager Zhou predicted that blue chips will continue to rally due to their relatively low valuations and stable returns, saying it is “a new cycle that has just started”. Hou Bin, a fund manager at Goldstate Capital Fund Management Co, said he favored modestly-priced banking and home appliance stocks, because “when liquidity conditions tend to tighten, and risk appetite is low, stocks with high valuations will be dumped”. But Wu Kan, head of equity trading at Shanshan Finance, said there may be a silver lining in that painful process for discerning investors. “As the bubble deflates, there will definitely be bargain opportunities for those real growth stocks with core competitiveness.” ",4202017,http://www.reuters.com/article/china-nifty50/china-investors-chase-nifty-50-as-love-affair-with-small-caps-sours-idUSL3N1HQ3QG

428,IBM,CORRECTED-German project looks to home photovoltaic systems to help grid," (Corrects to read solar battery maker, paragraph 1) FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Grid operator Tennet and solar battery maker Sonnen GmbH have launched a pilot project that will tap home photovoltaic (PV) systems to help iron out imbalances on Germany’s power network. TenneT and Sonnen’s e-Services subsidiary aim to sign up 6,000 household PV producers equipped with storage batteries by the end of May. The project will be supported by blockchain technology from IBM, which works as an inexpensive transaction-processing system for tracking and recording encrypted information. It holds potential to link up small energy “prosumers” and make them independent of centralized power providers. “A home storage unit for solar power on its own is less valuable than one that can be used collectively,” said Philipp Schroeder, director of sales and marketing at Bavaria-based Sonnen. “We will be able to create a big virtual power line. That is revolutionary.” The two partners aim to initially pool 24 megawatts (MW) of power capacity for TenneT to use as a buffer for variable wind power. “Balancing” power is so far handled mainly by traditional power plants while surplus wind power is often dealt with by curbing turbine output or throwing output away. “We want to find out how we can reduce the waste of wind power by storing it in Sonnen batteries that we can access in the North while releasing power from solar energy stored at Sonnen batteries in southern Germany,” said Urban Keussen, board chairman of the board at TenneT’s German unit. Germany currently subsidizes renewable power producers with billions of euros a year, regardless of demand. Because network development lags far behind, a lot of power is wasted because the north houses most of Germany’s wind turbines whose output cannot reach industrial users in the south. New transport lines, funded via grid fees charged to consumers, will take years to build. Schroeder said he saw big potential for solar pv “communities” filling gaps in the meantime. Germany has 15 million detached houses and 1.7 million photovoltaic units, but only 50,000 home storage units. Should 10 percent of all households use solar plus storage in 10 years, that would create capacity of some 6 gigawatts of power, he said, equivalent to six nuclear plants.

429,IBM,Warren Buffett says he sold a third of stake in IBM: CNBC,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett said he has sold about one-third of Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s (BRKa.N) big stake in IBM Corp (IBM.N), CNBC reported on Thursday, reducing a bet by the famed investor that surprised many and which so far has yet to prove successful. IBM’s stock touched $180 on Feb 14 and reached a high of $182.78 during Feb. 16 trading. It closed on Thursday at $159.05 on the New York Stock Exchange. Berkshire and Buffett’s assistant did not immediately respond to telephone and email requests for comment. IBM could not be reached for comment outside regular business hours. Buffett owned about 81 million shares of IBM at the end of 2016 and sold about a third in the first and second quarters of 2017, CNBC reported, citing Buffett. “I don’t value IBM the same way that I did six years ago when I started buying ...

Buffett has long been willing to sell stock investments, as opposed to entire businesses, when they do not pan out or he finds something better. “IBM is a big strong company, but they’ve got big strong competitors, too,” he said.

438,IBM,"UPDATE 1-Buffett's Berkshire boosts American, Southwest airline bets; sheds Fox","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) on Monday said it added to its sizable investments in American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) and Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N), and shed its stake in Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O). In a regulatory filing, Berkshire said that in the first quarter its American stake grew 8 percent to 49.3 million shares worth $2.08 billion, while its Southwest stake grew 10 percent to 47.7 million shares worth $2.57 billion. Berkshire also shed 8 percent of its holdings in Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), ending March with 55 million shares worth $2.53 billion. Buffett became one of the largest investors in American, Delta, Southwest and United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) last year, reversing his disdain for an industry he once called a “death trap” for investors. He told shareholders at Berkshire’s annual meeting on May 6 that airlines’ business model had improved, with fewer unsold seats and an ability to charge for checked bags, seat choices and other amenities that were once free. Berkshire’s sale of its $251 million Fox stake came several months after the parent of Fox News became embroiled in a sexual harassment scandal, but before news surfaced that the network and top-rated host Bill O’Reilly paid about $13 million to settle harassment claims by five women. O’Reilly left Fox last month. It is unclear why Berkshire sold Fox or who made the investment, which began in 2014. Smaller equity investments at Berkshire are normally made by Buffett’s deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who together recently invested about $21 billion. Buffett’s assistant did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Berkshire’s stock holdings are closely scrutinized by investors hoping to learn what has won or lost Buffett’s favor. The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also owns some 90 businesses including the BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance and Dairy Queen ice cream. In Monday’s filing, Berkshire also said it owned 129.4 million Apple Inc (AAPL.O) shares worth $18.6 billion as of March 31, fewer than the 133 million shares that Buffett had said Berkshire owned a month earlier. It is unclear what accounted for the discrepancy. Berkshire also announced larger stakes in Bank of New York Mellon Co (BK.N) and satellite radio operator Sirius XM Holdings Inc (SIRI.O), and reduced stakes in International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) and commercial vehicle parts supplier Wabco Holdings Inc (WBC.N).

443,IBM,DERIVATIVES-DTCC on track for Q1 2018 blockchain CDS reporting,"LONDON, May 19 (IFR) - The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation plans to go live in the first quarter of 2018 with its blockchain-driven platform for credit default swaps reporting. The digital ledger platform will initially launch in shadow mode, operating alongside existing infrastructure. In conjunction with fintech partners Axoni, IBM and industry consortium R3, the post-trade infrastructure provider began work in January to rebuild its Trade Information Warehouse, which handles reporting on US$11trn of CDS notional, with a permissioned ledger. The initial launch comprises an internal replacement of DTCC’s mainframe processing system but the multi-step process aims to deliver widespread simplification of transaction reporting across the swaps market, potentially changing the role of trade repository operators altogether. “The real competence of DTCC is around governance and risk management for the members that own us,” said Robert Palatnick, chief technology architect at DTCC. “Instead of managing a data warehouse of golden copy data, we are going to be the network operator, providing the governance and risk management for those new networks.” For industry-owned DTCC, a shift in business model is the latest in a series of disruptions that include a move from paper certificates to digital settlements and a collapse in settlement volumes as a result of netting. “We have disrupted ourselves multiple times,” said Palatnick. “We’re industry owned, so the goal and intent is to work with the industry to develop new technologies that can solve operational challenges while reducing costs and risks.” While the first phase will see participants face the DTCC directly through the organisation’s own connection point or “node”, a second phase would see the DTCC provide nodes on the permissioned ledger to participant firms, enabling them to validate reported data and directly access information. A final phase would see firms taking down their own nodes, enabling participants to benefit from efficiencies by replacing some of their own internal capabilities with the new technology. With a plethora of blockchain projects underway across the financial services industry, DTCC’s CDS reporting venture is seen as a crucial test for technology that currently lacks standards, best practices and interoperability models. “We are leveraging a new technology and applying it to the existing business model,” said Palatnick. “The intended outcome of this initiative is clearly defined because we already have an established business with a network of firms submitting trades.” While CDS was an obvious place to start given the standardisation of contracts, DTCC plans to extend the technology across all asset classes in the future. That requires greater collaboration between the industry and regulators to drive standardisation, according to Chris Childs, CEO of DTCC’s Deriv/SERV. “All of the technology issues are solvable, but I’m interested in the level of collaboration required in the industry and the governance process that may be needed if the industry is really going to benefit from this technology,” said Childs, speaking at ISDA’s annual general meeting in Lisbon. “If we don’t have that approach, we may end up with another level of fragmentation using new technology.” Those hopes were supported by the CFTC’s launch of LabCFTC last week. The initiative is aimed at promoting responsible fintech innovation through improved regulatory certainty and identification of emerging technologies that can assist the regulator in its operations. “We’d like to treat fintech the same way the government treated the internet and firstly do no harm,” said Michael Gill, chief of staff at the CFTC, speaking at the Lisbon event. “As we go forward and the government makes more regulations, we want to have these technologies in mind so we don’t set something up that in the future will be an inhibitor to a shared ledger.” (Reporting by Helen Bartholomew)",5192017,http://www.reuters.com/article/derivatives-dtcc-on-track-for-q1-2018-bl/derivatives-dtcc-on-track-for-q1-2018-blockchain-cds-reporting-idUSL8N1IJ5BF
444,IBM,Ex-IBM employee from China pleads guilty to code theft charges,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former software engineer for IBM in China pleaded guilty on Friday to stealing proprietary source code from the company, federal prosecutors announced on Friday. Jiaqiang Xu, 31, pleaded guilty to economic espionage and theft of a trade secret before U.S. District Judge Kenneth Karas in White Plains, New York, prosecutors said. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 13. Leanne Marek, Xu’s attorney, declined to comment. Xu was arrested in December 2015 after meeting with an undercover officer at a White Plains hotel, where authorities said he was recorded saying he used the code to make software to sell to customers. He was originally charged with theft of a trade secret. The economic espionage charges were added in a superseding indictment filed last June. International Business Machines Corp was not identified by name in the complaint. But a LinkedIn profile for Xu said he was employed as a system software developer at IBM during the period in question.

452,IBM,"UPDATE 1-Fujitsu to reach agreement ""soon"" on integrating PC business with Lenovo","TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Fujitsu Ltd (6702.T) expects to reach an agreement “soon” on integrating its personal computer business with China’s Lenovo Group Ltd (0992.HK), Fujitsu President Tatsuya Tanaka said Tuesday. Fujitsu said in October that it was in talks with Lenovo to cooperate in the design and manufacture of PCs. The companies had been aiming to finalize an agreement by the end of March. “We are in the final stages of working out how best to create synergies for our two companies,” Tanaka said at a press conference on the company’s strategy. “We expect to wrap it up soon. “It’s not like something unexpected happened, but we are trying to discuss everything thoroughly,” he said. The talks are unfolding at a time when sales of increasingly sophisticated smartphones and tablet computers squeeze demand in a global PC market that peaked half a decade ago. For Lenovo, the world’s largest PC maker, a deal could help boost its purchasing power and consolidate its footing in a PC market where profit margins are thin. Its previous PC deals included buying the PC division of International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) in 2005 and creating a PC joint venture with NEC Corp (6701.T) in 2011. “Details of any potential cooperation remain under discussion and there is no timeframe to communicate at this time,” said Charlotte West, a spokeswoman for Lenovo. When asked on Tuesday about media reports that Fujitsu will join a Japanese government-led bidding consortium for struggling Toshiba Corp (6502.T), Tanaka said he was cautious about such a move and that it would be hard to convince Fujitsu shareholders of its merits. “We always want to be accountable to our shareholders for what we do and this is also the case. In that context I do not think we can make rational reasons why we want to join the consortium,” he said.

456,IBM,AIG teams with IBM to use blockchain for 'smart' insurance policy,"June 14 (Reuters) - Insurer American International Group Inc has partnered with International Business Machines Corp to develop a “smart” insurance policy that uses blockchain to manage complex international coverage, the companies said on Wednesday. AIG and IBM completed a pilot of a so-called “smart contract” multi-national policy for Standard Chartered Bank PLC which the companies said is the first of its kind using blockchain’s digital ledger technology. The Standard Chartered policy uses blockchain to facilitate sharing of real-time information for a main policy written in the United Kingdom, where the bank is headquartered, and three local policies in the United States, Singapore and Kenya. Big banks, investors and other financial institutions have invested millions of dollars in blockchain, hoping it could make transactions faster, easier and more secure. IBM has been partnering with leading companies in various industries, including Danish transport company Maersk , to create blockchain-based products that can streamline complex international dealings across sectors. Blockchain technology, which powers the digital currency bitcoin, enables data sharing across a network of individual computers. It has gained worldwide popularity due to its usefulness in recording and keeping track of assets or transactions across all industries. Multinational insurance coverage is often cumbersome because of a maze of international regulations, paperwork, and payment terms. “There’s a lot of back and forth and it’s all through email chains going around the world, instead of a centralized system,” Carol Barton, President of AIG Multinational said in an interview. A master policy is typically issued in the country where a company is headquartered, while affiliates often need coverage in other countries that impose varying rules, documentation, and payment terms. The real-time system allows companies, their units, and insurers, among others, to simultaneously share all data and documents about the policies, the companies said. It also notifies all of those involved about payments. The territories selected for Standard Chartered’s coverage each introduced a level of complexity for testing the technology, IBM said. For example, a Kenya regulation, known as “cash before cover,” requires policyholders to pay for their coverage before it is valid.

459,IBM,"INSIGHT-Under pressure, Western tech firms bow to Russian demands to share cyber secrets","WASHINGTON/MOSCOW, June 23 (Reuters) - Western technology companies, including Cisco, IBM and SAP , are acceding to demands by Moscow for access to closely guarded product security secrets, at a time when Russia has been accused of a growing number of cyber attacks on the West, a Reuters investigation has found. Russian authorities are asking Western tech companies to allow them to review source code for security products such as firewalls, anti-virus applications and software containing encryption before permitting the products to be imported and sold in the country. The requests, which have increased since 2014, are ostensibly done to ensure foreign spy agencies have not hidden any “backdoors” that would allow them to burrow into Russian systems. But those inspections also provide the Russians an opportunity to find vulnerabilities in the products’ source code - instructions that control the basic operations of computer equipment - current and former U.S. officials and security experts said. While a number of U.S. firms say they are playing ball to preserve their entree to Russia’s huge tech market, at least one U.S. firm, Symantec, told Reuters it has stopped cooperating with the source code reviews over security concerns. That halt has not been previously reported. Symantec said one of the labs inspecting its products was not independent enough from the Russian government. U.S. officials say they have warned firms about the risks of allowing the Russians to review their products’ source code, because of fears it could be used in cyber attacks. But they say they have no legal authority to stop the practice unless the technology has restricted military applications or violates U.S. sanctions. From their side, companies say they are under pressure to acquiesce to the demands from Russian regulators or risk being shut out of a lucrative market. The companies say they only allow Russia to review their source code in secure facilities that prevent code from being copied or altered. (Graphic on source code review process: tmsnrt.rs/2sZudWT) The demands are being made by Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), which the U.S. government says took part in the cyber attacks on Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and the 2014 hack of 500 million Yahoo email accounts. The FSB, which has denied involvement in both the election and Yahoo hacks, doubles as a regulator charged with approving the sale of sophisticated technology products in Russia. The reviews are also conducted by the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control (FSTEC), a Russian defense agency tasked with countering cyber espionage and protecting state secrets. Records published by FSTEC and reviewed by Reuters show that from 1996 to 2013, it conducted source code reviews as part of approvals for 13 technology products from Western companies. In the past three years alone it carried out 28 reviews. A Kremlin spokesman referred all questions to the FSB. The FSB did not respond to requests for comment. FSTEC said in a statement that its reviews were in line with international practice. The U.S. State Department declined to comment. Moscow’s source code requests have mushroomed in scope since U.S.-Russia relations went into a tailspin following the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, according to eight current and former U.S. officials, four company executives, three U.S. trade attorneys and Russian regulatory documents. In addition to IBM, Cisco and Germany’s SAP, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co and McAfee have also allowed Russia to conduct source code reviews of their products, according to people familiar with the companies’ interactions with Moscow and Russian regulatory records. Until now, little has been known about that regulatory review process outside of the industry. The FSTEC documents and interviews with those involved in the reviews provide a rare window into the tense push-and-pull between technology companies and governments in an era of mounting alarm about hacking. Roszel Thomsen, an attorney who helps U.S. tech companies navigate Russia import laws, said the firms must balance the dangers of revealing source code to Russian security services against possible lost sales. “Some companies do refuse,” he said. “Others look at the potential market and take the risk.” If tech firms do decline the FSB’s source code requests, then approval for their products can be indefinitely delayed or denied outright, U.S. trade attorneys and U.S. officials said. The Russian information technology market is expected to be worth $18.4 billion this year, according to market researcher International Data Corporation (IDC). Six current and former U.S. officials who have dealt with companies on the issue said they are suspicious about Russia’s motives for the expanded reviews. “It’s something we have a real concern about,” said a former senior Commerce Department official who had direct knowledge of the interaction between U.S. companies and Russian officials until he left office this year. “You have to ask yourself what it is they are trying to do, and clearly they are trying to look for information they can use to their advantage to exploit, and that’s obviously a real problem.” However, none of the officials who spoke to Reuters could point to specific examples of hacks or cyber espionage that were made possible by the review process. Source code requests are not unique to Russia. In the United States, tech companies allow the government to audit source code in limited instances as part of defense contracts and other sensitive government work. China sometimes also requires source code reviews as a condition to import commercial software, U.S. trade attorneys say. The reviews often takes place in secure facilities known as “clean rooms.” Several of the Russian companies that conduct the testing for Western tech companies on behalf of Russian regulators have current or previous links to the Russian military, according to their websites. Echelon, a Moscow-based technology testing company, is one of several independent FSB-accredited testing centers that Western companies can hire to help obtain FSB approval for their products. Echelon CEO Alexey Markov told Reuters his engineers review source code in special laboratories, controlled by the companies, where no software data can be altered or transferred. Markov said Echelon is a private and independent company but does have a business relationship with Russia’s military and law enforcement authorities. Echelon’s website touts medals it was awarded in 2013 by Russia’s Ministry of Defense for “protection of state secrets.” The company’s website also sometimes refers to Markov as the “Head of Attestation Center of the Ministry of Defense.” In an email, Markov said that title is only intended to convey Echelon’s role as a certified outside tester of military technology testing. The medals were generic and insignificant, he said. But for Symantec, the lab “didn’t meet our bar” for independence, said spokeswoman Kristen Batch. “In the case of Russia, we decided the protection of our customer base through the deployment of uncompromised security products was more important than pursuing an increase in market share in Russia,” said Batch, who added that the company did not believe Russia had tried to hack into its products. In 2016, the company decided it would no longer use third parties, including Echelon, that have ties to a foreign state or get most of their revenue from government-mandated security testing. “It poses a risk to the integrity of our products that we are not willing to accept,” she said. Without the source code approval, Symantec can no longer get approval to sell some of its business-oriented security products in Russia. “As a result, we do minimal business there,” she said. Markov declined to comment on Symantec’s decision, citing a non-disclosure agreement with the company. Over the past year, HP has used Echelon to allow FSTEC to review source code, according to the agency’s records. A company spokesman declined to comment. An IBM spokesman confirmed the company allows Russia to review its source code in secure, company-controlled facilities “where strict procedures are followed.” FSTEC certification records showed the Information Security Center, an independent testing company based outside Moscow, has reviewed IBM’s source code on behalf of the agency. The company was founded more than 20 years ago under the auspices of an institute within Russia’s Ministry of Defense, according to its website. The company did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, McAfee said the Russia code reviews were conducted  at “certified testing labs” at company-owned premises in the United States. SAP allows Russia to review and test source code in a secure SAP facility in Germany, according to a person familiar with the process. In a company statement, SAP said the review process assures Russian customers “their SAP software investments are safe and secure.” Cisco has recently allowed Russia to review source code, according to a person familiar with the matter. A Cisco spokeswoman declined to comment on the company’s interactions with Russian authorities but said the firm does sometimes allow regulators to inspect small parts of its code in “trusted” independent labs and that the reviews do not compromise the security of its products. Before allowing the reviews, Cisco scrutinizes the code to ensure they are not exposing vulnerabilities that could be used to hack the products, she said.

Roszel Thomsen, an attorney who helps U.S. tech companies navigate Russia import laws, said the firms must balance the dangers of revealing source code to Russian security services against possible lost sales.  “Some companies do refuse,” he said. “Others look at the potential market and take the risk.”  If tech firms do decline the FSB’s source code requests, then approval for their products can be indefinitely delayed or denied outright, U.S. trade attorneys and U.S. officials said. The Russian information technology market is expected to be worth $18.4 billion this year, according to market researcher International Data Corporation (IDC).  Six current and former U.S. officials who have dealt with companies on the issue said they are suspicious about Russia’s motives for the expanded reviews.  “It’s something we have a real concern about,” said a former senior Commerce Department official who had direct knowledge of the interaction between U.S. companies and Russian officials until he left office this year. “You have to ask yourself what it is they are trying to do, and clearly they are trying to look for information they can use to their advantage to exploit, and that’s obviously a real problem.”  However, none of the officials who spoke to Reuters could point to specific examples of hacks or cyber espionage that were made possible by the review process.  Source code requests are not unique to Russia. In the United States, tech companies allow the government to audit source code in limited instances as part of defense contracts and other sensitive government work. China sometimes also requires source code reviews as a condition to import commercial software, U.S. trade attorneys say.  The reviews often takes place in secure facilities known as “clean rooms.” Several of the Russian companies that conduct the testing for Western tech companies on behalf of Russian regulators have current or previous links to the Russian military, according to their websites.  Echelon, a Moscow-based technology testing company, is one of several independent FSB-accredited testing centers that Western companies can hire to help obtain FSB approval for their products.  Echelon CEO Alexey Markov told Reuters his engineers review source code in special laboratories, controlled by the companies, where no software data can be altered or transferred.    Markov said Echelon is a private and independent company but does have a business relationship with Russia’s military and law enforcement authorities.  Echelon’s website touts medals it was awarded in 2013 by Russia’s Ministry of Defense for “protection of state secrets.” The company’s website also sometimes refers to Markov as the “Head of Attestation Center of the Ministry of Defense.”  In an email, Markov said that title is only intended to convey Echelon’s role as a certified outside tester of military technology testing. The medals were generic and insignificant, he said.  But for Symantec, the lab “didn’t meet our bar” for independence, said spokeswoman Kristen Batch.  “In the case of Russia, we decided the protection of our customer base through the deployment of uncompromised security products was more important than pursuing an increase in market share in Russia,” said Batch, who added that the company did not believe Russia had tried to hack into its products.  In 2016, the company decided it would no longer use third parties, including Echelon, that have ties to a foreign state or get most of their revenue from government-mandated security testing.  “It poses a risk to the integrity of our products that we are not willing to accept,” she said.  Without the source code approval, Symantec can no longer get approval to sell some of its business-oriented security products in Russia. “As a result, we do minimal business there,” she said.  Markov declined to comment on Symantec’s decision, citing a non-disclosure agreement with the company.  Over the past year, HP has used Echelon to allow FSTEC to review source code, according to the agency’s records. A company spokesman declined to comment.        An IBM spokesman confirmed the company allows Russia to review its source code in secure, company-controlled facilities “where strict procedures are followed.”  FSTEC certification records showed the Information Security Center, an independent testing company based outside Moscow, has reviewed IBM’s source code on behalf of the agency. The company was founded more than 20 years ago under the auspices of an institute within Russia’s Ministry of Defense, according to its website. The company did not respond to requests for comment.  In a statement, McAfee said the Russia code reviews were conducted  at “certified testing labs” at company-owned premises in the United States.  SAP allows Russia to review and test source code in a secure SAP facility in Germany, according to a person familiar with the process. In a company statement, SAP said the review process assures Russian customers “their SAP software investments are safe and secure.”  Cisco has recently allowed Russia to review source code, according to a person familiar with the matter.  A Cisco spokeswoman declined to comment on the company’s interactions with Russian authorities but said the firm does sometimes allow regulators to inspect small parts of its code in “trusted” independent labs and that the reviews do not compromise the security of its products.  Before allowing the reviews, Cisco scrutinizes the code to ensure they are not exposing vulnerabilities that could be used to hack the products, she said.

461,IBM,Banks' blockchain consortium picks IBM for trade finance platform,"PARIS (Reuters) - Tech giant IBM is building a blockchain-based platform for seven big European banks, including HSBC and Deutsche Bank, that is aimed at simplifying trade finance transactions for small- and medium-sized companies.  Trade finance was identified by a survey of banks carried out by IBM and the Economist Intelligence Unit last year as one of the top areas where blockchain - the underlying technology behind bitcoin - could have an impact. Blockchain technology provides an electronic record-keeping and transaction-processing system, which lets all parties track documentation through a secure network and requires no third-party verification.  This contrasts with the present process - trade finance transactions typically involve a complicated paper trail that requires international courier services, is vulnerable to document fraud, and can take as long as a month to be completed. “What we will have is a platform to bring buyers and sellers together and to make trade transactions very transparent from... the moment that a purchase order is issued up until payment,” said Hubert Bdenoot, general manager for trade finance at KBC, one of the banks in the consortium. “The first service that will be available for buyers and sellers is financing and risk coverage, and it will also include a track-and-trade system so that buyers and sellers can follow the physical transfer of the goods,” he told Reuters. The “Digital Trade Chain Consortium”, which also includes Societe Generale, Natixis, Rabobank and Unicredit, is aiming for the platform to be up-and-running and available for SMEs to use by the end of the year.      “There are over 20 million SMEs in Europe, and they provide around 85 percent of the jobs as well, so it’s a critical part of the economy and so anything that can facilitate growth in the SME community is going to help a lot,” said Keith Bear, vice president for financial markets and head of blockchain at IBM.   But KBC’s Bdenoot said the new platform was unlikely to suddenly revolutionize the market.  “I don’t think this is going to be something that enters the market and then all of a sudden half of the SMEs are on the platform - I don’t think that’s realistic,” he said. “I think this is something that has to grow, but which will create a halo effect in the market.” ",6262017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-banks-blockchain-ibm/banks-blockchain-consortium-picks-ibm-for-trade-finance-platform-idUSKBN19H2M6

IBM fell 4.7 percent to a one-year low after the company’s quarterly revenue came in below expectations. The stock was the biggest drag on the Dow and the S&P; 500. The S&P; tech sector has been the best performing sector this year despite concerns about stretched valuations as investors look for growth sectors immune to policy uncertainties. “At least in the second quarter and for the next quarter technology is the only sector that will see double-digit growth,” said Tom Cassidy, chief investment officer at Univest Wealth Management Division. “If you look at the sector, it isn’t all that overvalued compared to the broader S&P; index, except for a few names.” Microsoft and Facebook were among the top-three boosts to the S&P; and the Nasdaq. They are due to report results this week and next. Netflix’s stellar results had propelled the Nasdaq to close at a record high on Tuesday, helping the index post its longest streak of gains since February 2015. At 12:38 p.m. ET (1638 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 25.36 points, or 0.12 percent, at 21,600.09, the S&P; 500 was up 8.83 points, or 0.35 percent, at 2,469.44. The Nasdaq Composite was up 37.60 points, or 0.59 percent, at 6,381.91. Nine of the 11 major S&P; 500 sectors were higher, with the energy index and health sector leading the advancers. Vertex Pharmaceuticals jumped as much as 26.3 percent to an all-time high after the company reported positive results for its cystic fibrosis treatment. The stock was the biggest boost on the S&P; and the Nasdaq. Investors will continue to focus on quarterly earnings to see if high valuations are justified in the face of mixed economic data, tepid inflation and policy gridlock in Washington. Analysts estimate an 8.7 percent rise in second-quarter earnings and a 4.6 percent increase in revenue for the S&P; 500 companies from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Morgan Stanley rose 2.1 percent after the Wall Street bank reported better-than-expected profit and bond trading revenue declines that were modest compared with arch-rival Goldman Sachs’. Goldman was down 0.5 percent. CSX fell 6.5 percent after the third-largest U.S. railroad operator’s forecast missed expectations. Other railroad companies such as Union Pacific fell 2 percent, while Kansas City Southern edged down 0.7 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,057 to 750.

The S&P; tech sector has been the best performing sector this year despite concerns about stretched valuations as investors look for growth sectors immune to policy uncertainties. “Netflix’s strong results has caused money to move to tech stocks in anticipation of stronger earnings,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer at 50 Park Investments. “If the big names such as Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon are able to show growth in an otherwise low-growth environment, then investors will pay for these stocks.” All three big tech names will report results next week. Microsoft, which reports results on Thursday, was up 0.6 percent and was among the biggest boosts to the S&P; and the Nasdaq.

469,IBM,London Stock Exchange Group tests blockchain for private company shares,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - The London Stock Exchange Group Plc has teamed up with IBM to build a blockchain-based platform to digitally issue private shares of small and medium enterprises in Italy. The platform is being built and tested by Borsa Italiana, the LSEG’s Italian exchange operator, and will seek to make it easier to track and exchange shareholder information of unlisted businesses, the companies said on Wednesday. Blockchain, which first emerged as the system powering the cryptocurrency bitcoin, is a shared record of information that is maintained by a network of computers on the internet, without the need of a trusted third party.  Information on a blockchain can be viewed by all parties connected to the network but can only be amended if each participant agrees to the changes. This creates a shared golden source of data that can reduce the need for reconciliation between records held by different companies. Information on shareholders of small and medium enterprises has traditionally been maintained manually on spreadsheets or even on paper-based records, with each party holding their own version of information. A shared digital ledger would make it easier for companies to interact with their shareholders and provide more transparency on their ownership, LSEG said. “As these companies grow they will be better at interacting with their shareholders,” David Harris, head of emerging technology at LSEG, said in an interview.  The exchange group hopes that the new technology, which is built using a type of blockchain called HyperLegder Fabric, will also make it easier for companies to access credit.   HyperLedger Fabric was recently released by Hyperledger, an open-source group led by the Linux Foundation whose members also include IBM and LSEG. Financial institutions have been increasing their investment in blockchain over the past few years in the hopes that it can help reduce the cost and complexity of some of their processes.   While excitement around the technology has boomed, skeptics have warned that it is still in its early days and its potential may have been overblown. The new platform, which was built to work with the group’s existing systems, is undergoing an initial test phase with a small group clients and partners, LSEG said.

470,IBM,"IBM misses revenue estimates, weighed down by legacy businesses","(Reuters) - IBM Corp (IBM.N) on Tuesday reported a lower-than-expected quarterly revenue, as growth in its higher-margin businesses that include cloud and artificial intelligence services failed to make up for declines across legacy business segments. IBM’s shares fell 3 percent to $149.15 in after-market trading. Armonk, New York-based IBM has in recent years shifted focus to pockets of growth across its business — high-margin areas such as cloud, cybersecurity and data analytics — to counter a slowdown in its hardware and software businesses. Revenue from these initiatives, which IBM calls “strategic imperatives,” rose 5 percent in the second quarter ended June 30. However, some analysts have expressed concern that IBM’s aggressive investments in areas such as artificial intelligence offering Watson have done little to boost revenue overall. Revenue in IBM’s technology services and cloud platforms business — its largest — fell 5.1 percent to $8.41 billion. Analysts on average had expected $8.58 billion, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. Revenue in other units including software, hardware and consulting services also declined. Still, IBM backed its forecast for 2017 adjusted earnings of at least $13.80 per share, an expectation some analysts have called too high. Analysts on average expect earnings of $13.68 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. IBM will benefit from the launch of its new mainframe server — seen as key to its cybersecurity initiatives — as well as new contracts in the second half of 2017, Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter said on a conference call. Schroeter, in an interview, said growth in IBM’s “strategic imperatives” would be back at a 10 percent to 11 percent range by the end of the year. IBM’s total revenue dipped 4.7 percent to $19.29 billion, marking the steepest fall in five quarters. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $19.46 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

476,IBM,IBM to appeal judge's order to pay $78 million to Indiana,"(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp said on Monday it will appeal an Indiana judge’s ruling that calls for the technology company to pay more than $78 million in damages to the state for failing to modernize the government’s welfare system.  Marion Superior Court Judge Heather Welch ruled on Friday that Indiana was entitled to $128 million in damages for the breach of contract by the company. Welch also said IBM was entitled to nearly $50 million in damages for equipment fees and related costs, according to court documents.  IBM and Indiana in 2006 signed a contract under which the company would modernize the state’s welfare system. But the state terminated the contract three years later, claiming IBM fell short of the stated goals. “IBM will appeal this decision which is contradicted by the facts and the law,” IBM spokesman Clint Roswell said in a statement on Monday. “IBM worked diligently and invested significant resources ... to help turn around a welfare system described at the time by Indiana’s governor as one of the worst in the nation,” he added.  State officials said on Monday that they were pleased with the decision. “This is a very positive step forward to vindicate the actions the state took in 2009 to terminate the contract with IBM,” Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb said in a statement. “We look forward to the resolution of the lawsuit.” One of the state’s attorneys, Peter Rusthoven, said IBM “refused all along to take responsibility for its poor performance.”  IBM and Indiana sued each other in 2010, alleging breach of contract. The two cases were consolidated and a judge in 2012 found no breach of contract by IBM, which was awarded $49.5 million in past-due fees after a six-week bench trial in Marion Superior Court.  Both parties appealed and the state Supreme Court found last year that IBM breached the contract and sent the case to Welch’s court to determine damages.

489,IBM,Special Report: Drowning in grain - How Big Ag sowed seeds of a profit-slashing glut," CARMAN, Manitoba (Reuters) - On Canada’s fertile Prairies, dominated by the yellows and golds of canola and wheat, summers are too short to grow corn on a major scale.  But Monsanto Co MON.N is working to develop what it hopes will be North America’s fastest-maturing corn, allowing farmers to grow more in Western Canada and other inhospitable climates, such as Ukraine.  The seed and chemical giant projects that western Canadian corn plantings could multiply 20 times to 10 million acres by 2025 - adding some 1.1 billion bushels, or nearly 3 percent to current global production.  The question, amid historically high supplies and low grain prices, is whether the world really needs more corn.  A global grains glut is now in its fourth year, with supplies bloated by favorable weather, increasingly high-tech farm practices and tougher plant breeds.  The bin-busting harvests of cheap corn, wheat and soybeans are undermining the business models of the world’s largest agriculture firms and the farmers who use their products and services. Some analysts say the firms have effectively innovated their way into a stubbornly oversupplied market.  Never has the world produced so much more food than can be consumed in one season. World ending stocks of total grains - the leftover supplies before a new harvest - have climbed for four straight years and are poised to reach a record 638 million tonnes in 2016/17, according to USDA data.  Farmers and agriculture firms could once count on periodic bouts of crop-destroying weather to tame gluts and drive up prices. But genetically modified crops that repel plant-chewing insects, withstand lethal chemicals and mature faster have made the trend toward oversupply more resistant to traditional boom-and-bust agrarian cycles, experts say.  Another key factor: China - the world’s second-biggest corn grower - adopted stockpiling policies a decade ago when crop supplies ran thin, resulting in greater production than the world needs.  “I think the norm is where we are now,” said Bryan Agbabian, director of agriculture equities at Allianz Global Investors.  Allianz investors seem to agree: The value of two agriculture equity funds that Agbabian manages fell to $300 million this year from $800 million in 2011 as crop prices slid, he said.  Abundant supplies have helped lower food prices across the world, but the benefit to consumers and impoverished nations is muted by several factors, including problems with corruption and distribution of food in developing regions, said Sylvain Charlebois, professor of food distribution and policy at Canada’s Dalhousie University.  The bumper harvests may actually harm poor communities more than they benefit their residents in food savings because lower prices depress farm incomes in the same areas, said John Baffes, a senior economist at the World Bank.  Even as farmers reap bountiful harvests, U.S. net farm incomes this year will total $63.4 billion - about half of their earnings in 2013, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast.  Lower incomes mean farmers cannot spend as much on seed, fertilizer and machinery, extending their pain to firms across the agriculture sector.  Potash Corp of Saskatchewan POT.TO, the world’s biggest fertilizer company by capacity, closed its newest potash mine last year, eliminating more than 400 jobs, and has seen its U.S.-listed shares fall by nearly half since the beginning of 2015. The drop erased $14 billion in value, and left Potash seeking to merge with rival Agrium Inc AGU.TO.  With profits under pressure, seed and chemical companies are scrambling to consolidate.  Monsanto’s annual profit in 2016 was its smallest in six years. It agreed last year to combine with Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE), which would create the world’s largest integrated pesticide and seed company if the deal closes next year.  Grain handler Bunge Ltd (BG.N) said this summer it would cut costs, and left the door open to selling itself after posting a 34 percent drop in quarterly earnings.  Bunge CEO Soren Schroder sought to reassure investors in May by saying all that was needed to trim supplies was one bad stretch of weather in the U.S. Midwest.  But the glut pervades many major farming regions, making it unlikely that drought or floods in one region could wipe out the mounting global surplus. Even with dry conditions in North America, Europe and Australia, the U.S. Department of Agriculture forecasts that this year will bring the second-biggest global corn, wheat and soybean harvests ever.  Bunge’s Schroder made his comment about bad weather less than three weeks before confirming an informal merger approach from commodities giant Glencore Plc (GLEN.L).  “When prices tanked, farmers were no longer willing to pay more” for seed and chemicals, said Jonas Oxgaard, analyst at investment management firm Bernstein. “The mergers are absolutely driven by oversupply because their growth is gone.”  Monsanto spokeswoman Trish Jordan said the company believes demand growth still justifies corn expansion, and she disputed the notion that crop science advances are backfiring on agricultural technology firms.  Monsanto rival DowDuPont Inc (DWDP.N) is making the same bet and currently sells the shortest-season field corn in North America, maturing in 70 days, spokesman Ali Aziz said.  Success in the lab and the field, however, has contributed to oversupply and may continue to sustain it, said Oxgaard, the Bernstein analyst.  ""It's somewhat the seed companies' fault - they keep breeding better and better seeds every year,"" he said.  Charles Darwin helped plant the seeds of the grain glut. The biologist and evolution theorist showed in the late 1800s that cross-fertilization of plants - in which sex cells are fused between crop varieties of the same species - creates a more vigorous breed than those that are self-fertilized.  His work and others’ influenced successive generations of crop scientists and led to the development of hybrid corn, said Stephen Moose, a professor specializing in crop genetics at University of Illinois.  U.S. farmers started planting the first significant acres of hybrid corn in the 1930s, and by 1950 it made up nearly all the corn seeded in the United States.  Yields exploded. Farmers who reaped 20.5 bushels of corn per acre in 1930 harvested an average of 38.2 bushels in 1950, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  Further hybrid breeding breakthroughs generated corn with leaves that grow more erect, allowing farmers to sow it more densely without starving plants of sunlight. Yields first topped 100 bushels per acre in 1978.  After conventional breeding breakthroughs became harder to find, corn gained new vigor through the 1990s with genetic modification.  In 1996, U.S. regulators approved corn that was genetically engineered to produce bug-killing proteins, accomplished by inserting a bacterium hostile to the corn borer insect into the plant genome.  Before the end of the 1990s, corn able to resist weed-killing chemical glufosinate or Monsanto’s glyphosate hit the market.  Those modified varieties and others that followed proved pivotal in generating the abundant corn crops that have since become commonplace, Moose said.  “In the seed industry, it stimulated a whole other round of investment,” Moose said.  In the 20 years since GMO corn reached U.S. farms, yields jumped another 37 percent to a record 174.6 bushels per acre last year.  Some experts believe the expansion of corn yields may soon hit a ceiling. The crop may be nearing the natural limit of its production potential, and crop yields will likely plateau in the next decade, based on how plants convert light to food and their ability to recover from heat, said Ken Cassman, agronomy professor at University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  Technology has also provided better defenses against pests.  Syngenta AG’s SYNN.S Viptera and Duracade traits, used to control worms and beetles, launched in 2010 and 2013. SmartStax corn seed, introduced by Monsanto and Dow in 2009, brought twin benefits of insect protection and herbicide tolerance, said Paul Bertels, vice-president of production and sustainability at U.S.-based National Corn Growers Association.  The breakthroughs in seed and pesticide technologies have not come without problems. Monsanto is now embroiled in a controversy over dicamba, a big-selling chemical designed to kill weeds that harm Monsanto’s genetically modified crops.  Many U.S. farmers say dicamba has drifted from its intended fields, damaging plants that are not resistant to the chemical. Monsanto believes the main causes of drifting are errors by farmers and applicators in deploying the herbicide, company spokeswoman Charla Lord said.  As it grew stronger, corn grew faster. Corn that required 120 days to mature in the U.S. Corn Belt during the 1960s now needs only 105 to 115 days.  Farmers in northern North Dakota plant and harvest corn in 80 days, and have doubled the state’s production in five years.  Fast corn is now stirring even the imaginations of researchers in the far north.  University of Alaska Fairbanks horticulture professor Meriam Karlsson grew hundreds of corn plants in the Arctic state in 2015.  The plants, germinated in a greenhouse before they were transplanted outside, grew from a short-season garden corn variety that matured in less than 60 days. Corn rose only four to five feet, allowing plants to spend maximum energy on growing ears, rather than leaves and stalks.  Karlsson had expected few corn plants to survive in Fairbanks - less than 120 miles (190 kilometers) from the Arctic Circle.  “It’s much more adaptable than I expected,” she said. “Amazing what breeding can do. It was kind of exciting that you could do it.”  The lure of technology comes down to money for farmers.  Even with Chicago corn futures down more than 50 percent from their 2012 record high, the high-yielding crop offers one of the strongest returns to Canadian farmers, generating profits per acre four times that of canola, based on average prices and costs, said National Bank analyst Greg Colman.  As corn spreads across the Canadian Prairies, those robust yields are winning farmers over, said Dan Wright, Monsanto Canada’s lead for corn and soybeans.  “Once you harvest corn at 140 or 180 bushels, it’s something you want to do again,” he said.  While corn compares nicely to some crops, it offers U.S. farmers marginal returns at current prices, Bernstein’s Oxgaard said. Switching to other crops is not easy in areas like the U.S. Midwest, where farmers traditionally swing between corn and soybeans, and have invested in costly equipment to grow them.  The problems of plenty were on nobody’s mind less than a decade ago. In 2008, a dramatic food price run-up stirred riots from Haiti to Egypt.  Four years later, the U.S. Midwest, the engine of the global corn and soybean growing machine, suffered its worst drought in decades, opening gaping cracks in the soil and withering crops.  Chicago corn and soybean futures Cv1 Sv1 hit record highs as U.S. production fell to multi-year lows.  But high prices proved the cure for high prices.  Farmers in traditionally less productive corn-growing countries such as Russia, Argentina and Brazil expanded corn output to seize bigger profits.  U.S. farming quickly rebounded, reaping record corn harvests in three of the next four years.  New corn varieties have made global production more balanced than ever, with 12 countries producing at least 10 million tonnes of corn annually, up from 10 before the drought.  Even if U.S. or Brazilian corn crops suffered major weather damage, the world would still have the expanding Black Sea corn region to tap, not to mention China’s enormous supplies, said Bertels, of the U.S. corn growers association.  China’s stockpiling policies, enacted in 2007 when corn supplies were tight, also stimulated oversupply. Aiming for self-sufficiency in grains, Beijing bought virtually the entire domestic crop each year and paid farmers as much as 60 percent more than global prices.  The program stuffed Chinese warehouses with some 250 million tonnes of corn by the time Beijing scrapped it last year. China is now boosting incentives for farmers to switch to soybeans from corn.  “The world’s corn is mainly in China,” said Li Qiang, chief consultant at Shanghai JC Intelligence Co Ltd.  He said it will take three to four years for stocks to reach a “normal” level of around 40-50 million tonnes.  The Black Sea region, made up of Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, has become a disruptive force with rapidly expanding exports. Moscow aims to drive grain production to 150 million tonnes by 2030 from 117 million in 2016 after increasing storage and export capacity in ports in the last couple of years.  Glut conditions are expected to ease modestly this year, amid dry conditions in China and the United States, but supplies are still so large that prices remain weak.  In northern North Dakota, an expanding frontier for corn and soybeans, Paul Thomas started dabbling in both crops about a decade ago on his farm near Minot, seeking higher returns than wheat.  Both are now among his biggest crops, including short-season Monsanto corn varieties that have only been available for a couple of years.  Profits may be tougher for Thomas to eke out this year due to dry weather and soft prices, but he shrugs off the struggle.  “We’re very capable of producing a large amount of bushels given an economic incentive,” he said. “If we end up over-producing, then we shift to one that’s more in need. That’s just the way agriculture works.”  Thomas acknowledged, however, that the traditional dynamic may be changing in this current glut.  “I don’t know any single crop that isn’t in oversupply,” he said.  Seeding equipment is becoming more precise, and increasingly cost-conscious farmers are applying fertilizer and chemicals more intelligently, said Al Mussell, head of research at Canadian think tank Agri-Food Economic Systems.  Monsanto projects that corn will become by the mid-2020s one of the biggest crops produced in Canada, which is an agriculture-exporting powerhouse in canola, wheat, oats and pork.  Soybeans are also spreading across Canada. Farmers seeded a record high 7.3 million acres in 2017, up 75 percent in five years.  On Monsanto’s research farm in Carman, Manitoba, the next target is marketing a corn variety that matures in 70 days within the next two years. After that: an even quicker plant to snatch DowDuPont’s claim to North America’s fastest corn.  It is ambitious but realistic, said Kelly Boddy, manager of Monsanto’s research farm.  “Wind the clock back a few years,” he said, “and breeders wouldn’t have thought it possible.”  ",9272017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-grains-supply-special-report/special-report-drowning-in-grain-how-big-ag-sowed-seeds-of-a-profit-slashing-glut-idUSKCN1C21AR

Farmers and agriculture firms could once count on periodic bouts of crop-destroying weather to tame gluts and drive up prices. But genetically modified crops that repel plant-chewing insects, withstand lethal chemicals and mature faster have made the trend toward oversupply more resistant to traditional boom-and-bust agrarian cycles, experts say.  Another key factor: China - the world’s second-biggest corn grower - adopted stockpiling policies a decade ago when crop supplies ran thin, resulting in greater production than the world needs.  “I think the norm is where we are now,” said Bryan Agbabian, director of agriculture equities at Allianz Global Investors.  Allianz investors seem to agree: The value of two agriculture equity funds that Agbabian manages fell to $300 million this year from $800 million in 2011 as crop prices slid, he said.  Abundant supplies have helped lower food prices across the world, but the benefit to consumers and impoverished nations is muted by several factors, including problems with corruption and distribution of food in developing regions, said Sylvain Charlebois, professor of food distribution and policy at Canada’s Dalhousie University.  The bumper harvests may actually harm poor communities more than they benefit their residents in food savings because lower prices depress farm incomes in the same areas, said John Baffes, a senior economist at the World Bank.  Even as farmers reap bountiful harvests, U.S. net farm incomes this year will total $63.4 billion - about half of their earnings in 2013, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast.  Lower incomes mean farmers cannot spend as much on seed, fertilizer and machinery, extending their pain to firms across the agriculture sector.  Potash Corp of Saskatchewan POT.TO, the world’s biggest fertilizer company by capacity, closed its newest potash mine last year, eliminating more than 400 jobs, and has seen its U.S.-listed shares fall by nearly half since the beginning of 2015. The drop erased $14 billion in value, and left Potash seeking to merge with rival Agrium Inc AGU.TO.  With profits under pressure, seed and chemical companies are scrambling to consolidate.  Monsanto’s annual profit in 2016 was its smallest in six years. It agreed last year to combine with Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE), which would create the world’s largest integrated pesticide and seed company if the deal closes next year.  Grain handler Bunge Ltd (BG.N) said this summer it would cut costs, and left the door open to selling itself after posting a 34 percent drop in quarterly earnings.  Bunge CEO Soren Schroder sought to reassure investors in May by saying all that was needed to trim supplies was one bad stretch of weather in the U.S. Midwest.  But the glut pervades many major farming regions, making it unlikely that drought or floods in one region could wipe out the mounting global surplus. Even with dry conditions in North America, Europe and Australia, the U.S. Department of Agriculture forecasts that this year will bring the second-biggest global corn, wheat and soybean harvests ever.  Bunge’s Schroder made his comment about bad weather less than three weeks before confirming an informal merger approach from commodities giant Glencore Plc (GLEN.L).  “When prices tanked, farmers were no longer willing to pay more” for seed and chemicals, said Jonas Oxgaard, analyst at investment management firm Bernstein. “The mergers are absolutely driven by oversupply because their growth is gone.”  Monsanto spokeswoman Trish Jordan said the company believes demand growth still justifies corn expansion, and she disputed the notion that crop science advances are backfiring on agricultural technology firms.  Monsanto rival DowDuPont Inc (DWDP.N) is making the same bet and currently sells the shortest-season field corn in North America, maturing in 70 days, spokesman Ali Aziz said.  Success in the lab and the field, however, has contributed to oversupply and may continue to sustain it, said Oxgaard, the Bernstein analyst.  ""It's somewhat the seed companies' fault - they keep breeding better and better seeds every year,"" he said.  Charles Darwin helped plant the seeds of the grain glut. The biologist and evolution theorist showed in the late 1800s that cross-fertilization of plants - in which sex cells are fused between crop varieties of the same species - creates a more vigorous breed than those that are self-fertilized.  His work and others’ influenced successive generations of crop scientists and led to the development of hybrid corn, said Stephen Moose, a professor specializing in crop genetics at University of Illinois.  U.S. farmers started planting the first significant acres of hybrid corn in the 1930s, and by 1950 it made up nearly all the corn seeded in the United States.  Yields exploded. Farmers who reaped 20.5 bushels of corn per acre in 1930 harvested an average of 38.2 bushels in 1950, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  Further hybrid breeding breakthroughs generated corn with leaves that grow more erect, allowing farmers to sow it more densely without starving plants of sunlight. Yields first topped 100 bushels per acre in 1978.  After conventional breeding breakthroughs became harder to find, corn gained new vigor through the 1990s with genetic modification.  In 1996, U.S. regulators approved corn that was genetically engineered to produce bug-killing proteins, accomplished by inserting a bacterium hostile to the corn borer insect into the plant genome.  Before the end of the 1990s, corn able to resist weed-killing chemical glufosinate or Monsanto’s glyphosate hit the market.  Those modified varieties and others that followed proved pivotal in generating the abundant corn crops that have since become commonplace, Moose said.  “In the seed industry, it stimulated a whole other round of investment,” Moose said.  In the 20 years since GMO corn reached U.S. farms, yields jumped another 37 percent to a record 174.6 bushels per acre last year.  Some experts believe the expansion of corn yields may soon hit a ceiling. The crop may be nearing the natural limit of its production potential, and crop yields will likely plateau in the next decade, based on how plants convert light to food and their ability to recover from heat, said Ken Cassman, agronomy professor at University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  Technology has also provided better defenses against pests.  Syngenta AG’s SYNN.S Viptera and Duracade traits, used to control worms and beetles, launched in 2010 and 2013. SmartStax corn seed, introduced by Monsanto and Dow in 2009, brought twin benefits of insect protection and herbicide tolerance, said Paul Bertels, vice-president of production and sustainability at U.S.-based National Corn Growers Association.  The breakthroughs in seed and pesticide technologies have not come without problems. Monsanto is now embroiled in a controversy over dicamba, a big-selling chemical designed to kill weeds that harm Monsanto’s genetically modified crops.  Many U.S. farmers say dicamba has drifted from its intended fields, damaging plants that are not resistant to the chemical. Monsanto believes the main causes of drifting are errors by farmers and applicators in deploying the herbicide, company spokeswoman Charla Lord said.  As it grew stronger, corn grew faster. Corn that required 120 days to mature in the U.S. Corn Belt during the 1960s now needs only 105 to 115 days.  Farmers in northern North Dakota plant and harvest corn in 80 days, and have doubled the state’s production in five years.  Fast corn is now stirring even the imaginations of researchers in the far north.  University of Alaska Fairbanks horticulture professor Meriam Karlsson grew hundreds of corn plants in the Arctic state in 2015.  The plants, germinated in a greenhouse before they were transplanted outside, grew from a short-season garden corn variety that matured in less than 60 days. Corn rose only four to five feet, allowing plants to spend maximum energy on growing ears, rather than leaves and stalks.  Karlsson had expected few corn plants to survive in Fairbanks - less than 120 miles (190 kilometers) from the Arctic Circle.  “It’s much more adaptable than I expected,” she said. “Amazing what breeding can do. It was kind of exciting that you could do it.”  The lure of technology comes down to money for farmers.  Even with Chicago corn futures down more than 50 percent from their 2012 record high, the high-yielding crop offers one of the strongest returns to Canadian farmers, generating profits per acre four times that of canola, based on average prices and costs, said National Bank analyst Greg Colman.  As corn spreads across the Canadian Prairies, those robust yields are winning farmers over, said Dan Wright, Monsanto Canada’s lead for corn and soybeans.  “Once you harvest corn at 140 or 180 bushels, it’s something you want to do again,” he said.  While corn compares nicely to some crops, it offers U.S. farmers marginal returns at current prices, Bernstein’s Oxgaard said. Switching to other crops is not easy in areas like the U.S. Midwest, where farmers traditionally swing between corn and soybeans, and have invested in costly equipment to grow them.  The problems of plenty were on nobody’s mind less than a decade ago. In 2008, a dramatic food price run-up stirred riots from Haiti to Egypt.  Four years later, the U.S. Midwest, the engine of the global corn and soybean growing machine, suffered its worst drought in decades, opening gaping cracks in the soil and withering crops.  Chicago corn and soybean futures Cv1 Sv1 hit record highs as U.S. production fell to multi-year lows.  But high prices proved the cure for high prices.  Farmers in traditionally less productive corn-growing countries such as Russia, Argentina and Brazil expanded corn output to seize bigger profits.  U.S. farming quickly rebounded, reaping record corn harvests in three of the next four years.  New corn varieties have made global production more balanced than ever, with 12 countries producing at least 10 million tonnes of corn annually, up from 10 before the drought.  Even if U.S. or Brazilian corn crops suffered major weather damage, the world would still have the expanding Black Sea corn region to tap, not to mention China’s enormous supplies, said Bertels, of the U.S. corn growers association.  China’s stockpiling policies, enacted in 2007 when corn supplies were tight, also stimulated oversupply. Aiming for self-sufficiency in grains, Beijing bought virtually the entire domestic crop each year and paid farmers as much as 60 percent more than global prices.  The program stuffed Chinese warehouses with some 250 million tonnes of corn by the time Beijing scrapped it last year. China is now boosting incentives for farmers to switch to soybeans from corn.  “The world’s corn is mainly in China,” said Li Qiang, chief consultant at Shanghai JC Intelligence Co Ltd.  He said it will take three to four years for stocks to reach a “normal” level of around 40-50 million tonnes.  The Black Sea region, made up of Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, has become a disruptive force with rapidly expanding exports. Moscow aims to drive grain production to 150 million tonnes by 2030 from 117 million in 2016 after increasing storage and export capacity in ports in the last couple of years.  Glut conditions are expected to ease modestly this year, amid dry conditions in China and the United States, but supplies are still so large that prices remain weak.  In northern North Dakota, an expanding frontier for corn and soybeans, Paul Thomas started dabbling in both crops about a decade ago on his farm near Minot, seeking higher returns than wheat.  Both are now among his biggest crops, including short-season Monsanto corn varieties that have only been available for a couple of years.  Profits may be tougher for Thomas to eke out this year due to dry weather and soft prices, but he shrugs off the struggle.  “We’re very capable of producing a large amount of bushels given an economic incentive,” he said. “If we end up over-producing, then we shift to one that’s more in need. That’s just the way agriculture works.”  Thomas acknowledged, however, that the traditional dynamic may be changing in this current glut.  “I don’t know any single crop that isn’t in oversupply,” he said.  Seeding equipment is becoming more precise, and increasingly cost-conscious farmers are applying fertilizer and chemicals more intelligently, said Al Mussell, head of research at Canadian think tank Agri-Food Economic Systems.  Monsanto projects that corn will become by the mid-2020s one of the biggest crops produced in Canada, which is an agriculture-exporting powerhouse in canola, wheat, oats and pork.  Soybeans are also spreading across Canada. Farmers seeded a record high 7.3 million acres in 2017, up 75 percent in five years.  On Monsanto’s research farm in Carman, Manitoba, the next target is marketing a corn variety that matures in 70 days within the next two years. After that: an even quicker plant to snatch DowDuPont’s claim to North America’s fastest corn.  It is ambitious but realistic, said Kelly Boddy, manager of Monsanto’s research farm.  “Wind the clock back a few years,” he said, “and breeders wouldn’t have thought it possible.”  ",9272017,http://www.reuters.com/article/grains-supply/special-report-drowning-in-grain-how-big-ag-sowed-seeds-of-a-profit-slashing-glut-idUSL1N1J90G6

Shares of the Dow component rose nearly 5.1 percent to $153.93 in extended trading on Tuesday. IBM has been focusing on cloud, cybersecurity and data analytics, or what the company calls its “strategic imperatives”, to counter a slowdown in its legacy hardware and software businesses. Revenue from these businesses climbed 11 percent to $8.8 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, accounting for about 46 percent of the company’s total revenue. “Management is focused in the right areas, but still have some work and must demonstrate this growth is sustainable,” said Josh Olson, an analyst at Edward Jones.     Revenue from the cognitive solutions business, which includes the AI-powered supercomputer Watson, rose nearly 4 percent to $4.40 billion, after falling 2.5 percent in the previous quarter.  Analysts on average expected revenue of $4.17 billion, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet.  IBM said it expected revenue to grow $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion in fourth quarter from the third quarter.  This implies fourth-quarter revenue in the range of $22 billion to $22.1 billion, a year-on-year growth of about 1.4 percent at the high end. A part of the rise in revenue is expected to come from the mainframe business, which got a boost from the launch of Z14. Revenue in mainframe business jumped 60 percent in the third quarter, Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter told Reuters, adding that the business gained from Z14, which began shipping in mid-September. “The progress around the mainframe contribution, signings growth/visibility in consulting and positive trends in cloud likely sets up for further momentum in Q4,” said David Holt, an analyst with CFRA.

Long-dated U.S. Treasury yields rose and yields on the 2-year Treasury note US2YT=RR hit their highest level since November 2007, as investors bet on tighter global monetary policy.  All three Wall Street major indexes posted record closing highs. Strong earnings from International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average close above the 23,000 milestone for the first time. “People are of the mindset that there is no alternative to equities and therefore they’re continuing to pour into them,”  said Ian Winer, head of equities at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 160.16 points, or 0.7 percent, to 23,157.6, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 1.9 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,561.26 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 0.56 points, or 0.01 percent, to 6,624.22.

The 30-year bond US30YT=RR last fell 29/32 in price to yield 2.8483 percent, from 2.803 percent late on Tuesday.  Short-dated notes added to selling after comments from New York Fed President William Dudley, who sounded supportive of Fed Chair Janet Yellen’s weekend comments that the Fed was likely to continue its path of U.S. interest rate increases. While the dollar found some support from higher U.S. Treasury yields, the greenback, as measured against six other major currencies, reversed from a small gain to a small decline in afternoon trading. The dollar index .DXY fell 0.08 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.22 percent to $1.1792.  The dollar index may have hit technical resistance at around the 93.80 level, which could have restrained the currency’s rise at least in the near term, Eric Viloria, currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities in New York, said. “I think we are looking at generally consolidative movement in the U.S. dollar,” he said.

Shares of IBM, which beat expectations on revenue, were on course to record their biggest percentage gain in more than eight years and accounted for about 100 points of the 156 point-gain in the blue-chip index. The Dow had briefly surpassed the all-time peak on Tuesday but closed just shy of it. The latest 1,000-point increase was covered in roughly half the time it took the index to move from 21,000 to 22,000. “Today the catalyst is clearly IBM ... which appears to have turned the corner. It gave the Dow the boost to stay over 23,000,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. Solid earnings, stronger economic growth and hopes that President Donald Trump may be able to make progress on tax cuts have helped the market rally this year. The financial index jumped 0.5 percent, led by bank stocks that were recovering from recent post-earnings losses. A rise in Treasury yields and bullish calls by brokerages helped to support the bank shares. Bank shares had run up ahead of results, which resulted in some selling following the earnings news, the Krosby said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 154.69 points, or 0.67 percent, to 23,152.13, the S&P; 500 gained 3.09 points, or 0.12 percent, to 2,562.45 and the Nasdaq Composite added 7.74 points, or 0.12 percent, to 6,631.40.

503,IBM,IBM shares head for biggest gain in eight years,"(Reuters) - Shares in International Business Machines Inc (IBM.N) surged 9 percent on Wednesday after it beat expectations on revenue and gave an outlook that hinted one of the world’s first big computing names was back on a growth track after six years in retreat. There was no initial sign of changes to major brokerage ratings and most analysts shied away from calling a complete turnaround in the company’s fortunes. But both Citi and Barclays raised their price targets for the stock, helping it towards its biggest daily percentage gain since 2009 — a stark contrast with a nearly 12 percent fall so far this year. The rise in the share price, last at $159.79, added $12.6 billion to the company’s market value and accounted for nearly 90 of the 105 point gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday. “After a difficult first half, IBM turned in a solid quarter last night and we continue to believe the company will emerge from this transition a much stronger IT organization,” Drexel Hamilton Brian White wrote in a client note.  He has a “buy” rating on the stock and a $200 price target.  Another analyst, Jefferies John DiFucci, argued that while IBM has struggled more than peers such as Oracle Corp ORCL.O and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to adjust to a changing market, the quarterly performance of its software business was noteworthy. He warned against reading across from the firm’s results to others in the sector. “IBM has historically served as an indicator of overall software industry health, and as the world’s 3rd largest software vendor, its results are relevant,” he said.  “But we caution against direct read-throughs to other companies in recent times due to company-specific and secular challenges IBM has faced.” Revenue at the company, one of the world’s original PC producers but now a broad-based producer, integrator and software maker, has fallen for 22 straight quarters.  Weak demand from customers had left its legacy hardware and software businesses stagnating. The results showed revenue from IBM’s cloud, cybersecurity and data analytics business rose 11 percent to $8.8 billion in the quarter, accounting for about 46 percent of total revenue. The company’s software revenue also grew for the first time after 13 consecutive quarters of declines. “We were pleased to see the quality of IBM’s earnings improve, with IP income and taxes being less of a driver of upside than in prior quarters,” Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner wrote in a note. But she added: “We see the business as secularly challenged due to its high exposure to a legacy business model, and see continued margin pressure over the long-term as IBM’s business is pressured by competition from lower-cost offerings and the cloud.” Out of 25 analysts covering the stock, only 6 have a “buy” or higher rating, 15 are on “hold”, and 4 have a “sell” or lower. They have a median price target of $154.50. “The bottom line, IBM remains in a “work-in-progress” mode, as its continues to convert its revenue base away from asset/labor intensive legacy into asset/labor light “digital” solutions,” Wedbush analyst Moshe Katri said.

Solid earnings and hopes that President Donald Trump may be able to make progress on tax cuts have helped the market rally this year. “Looks like it’s set for a good start, largely driven by strong earnings and positive economic growth,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. “We’re in a sweet spot where the economy is growing not too strong and not too weak, the Fed’s tightening but not too rapidly and earnings continue to expand.

506,IBM,Doing the heavy lifting: investors eye tech-tonic shifts for Europe’s industrials,"LONDON (Reuters) - Investment funds seeking to invest at the intersection of Europe and technology are finding rich pickings in places that some may find surprising: sprawling industrials like trains-to-turbines Siemens and engineering group ABB. Building on their traditional expertise in factory automation, the conglomerates’ digital divisions are adding cutting-edge software and systems that help customers design, build and test their products faster and more cheaply. In so doing they bring new value to companies historically linked mainly to customers in the power, energy and mining sectors that have had to slash spending in the past few years due to a precipitous drop in commodity prices. Not only is the divisions’ growth outstripping that of legacy fossil-fuel businesses, but a trend toward breaking out their earnings separately in company reports allows investors to see value that was previously buried. “Your industrial company today is not your dirty factory bending metals and producing simple and large objects,” said Andreas Fruschki, director of equity research, Europe at AllianzGI. “It’s a more high-tech, nimble assembly site.”     Their efforts are attracting the attention of investors looking for less obvious technology plays as the tide turns against U.S. stocks like Facebook, Apple, Netflix and Google, due to their uncomfortably lofty valuations. Meanwhile in Asia the soaring market capitalization of a handful of companies such as China’s Alibaba and Tencent means investors in exchange traded funds (ETFs) who want exposure to a range of companies are finding themselves increasingly exposed to a single sector. The growth opportunities in European industrials are still limited by legacy businesses, however, said Neil Campling, head of global TMT research at Northern Trust Capital Markets. The oil & gas and mining sectors have cut capital expenditure to $706 billion in 2016 from $1.29 trillion in 2013, according to figures from S&P; Global, which added that a slight recovery is expected in 2017. “But you’re certainly seeing that factory automation, machine vision, automation, industry 4.0, improvements in supply chain systems, all these kinds of things ... (are) enjoying very strong growth,” Campling added.     Siemens’ Digital Factory, widely seen as the global leader in industrial software, only started reporting separate results in the German company statements in 2015. The 13 percent of 2016 revenue it contributed is still small fry compared with the power and energy divisions’ 40 percent. But while sales in Siemens’ power and gas segment declined 11 percent in the fiscal third quarter, digital saw 11 percent growth and accounted for more than a fifth of total profits. Swiss power grids maker ABB is also winning investors’ attention thanks to its robotics segment, although oil & gas, mining and other industries still account for more than 40 percent of company revenues. ABB Ability, a digital software and services platform that can connect to robots for remote monitoring and diagnostics, which partners with Microsoft and IBM, is starting to contribute to growth, ABB CEO Ulrich Spiesshofer said in a press release after the company released results for the second quarter that ended June 30. Robotics orders jumped 12 percent year-on-year in the quarter to more than 25 percent of the company’s total.   While some technology assets have been developed in-house or through collaboration, others have come from acquisitions. Siemens has spent more than $5 billion in the past 18 months acquiring industrial software companies while shedding legacy businesses like hearing aids and household appliances and preparing to list its giant healthcare unit. ABB this year bought automation software firm B&R; for almost $2 billion, the biggest acquisition under its current chief executive, to better challenge Siemens.    “The more exciting themes now are themes like automation, and that is definitely one we’ve angled our portfolios towards,” said Tim Crockford, European equities portfolio manager at Hermes.     Crockford added German forklift truck and robotics maker Kion Group to his portfolio in 2016 on expectations for growing demand for warehouse automation, driven by e-commerce, via its acquisition of U.S. firm Dematic last year. Bank of America Merrill Lynch singled out Swedish machinery maker Atlas Copco for its SmartLink data monitoring program for air compressors, which looks to anticipate problems before they arise, an example of how the “Internet of things” is transforming the way equipment works.  “Industrial companies with big software businesses generate stronger growth and profitability than their automation peers,” BAML said in a research note last month. While the European industrials sector has outperformed the broader MSCI Europe benchmark over the past year, the companies still haven’t reached the heights of tech stocks like semiconductor manufacturers. “There are no ‘pure’ plays in Europe,” Barclays capital goods analysts wrote in a note.

The seven co-chairs for the four-day event in January were announced in the face of criticism that the conference has in the past lacked female representation. “Co-chairs ... were chosen to reflect global stakeholders,” said a spokeswoman for WEF, adding the co-chairs were all leaders in their fields. The co-chairs shape the programme and lead discussions and panels. The theme of the 48th conference is to “explore the root causes of, and pragmatic solutions for, the manifold political, economic and social fractures facing global society,” WEF said. WEF, in an annual report this month, found it will take another 217 years before women earn as much as men and have equal representation in the workplace, revealing an economic gap of 58 percent. It is the second straight year the Swiss non-profit has recorded worsening economic inequality. A typical representative of the more than 2,500 titans of industry and influence that each January descend upon the Alps has received the unofficial moniker of ""Davos Man"" -- a sign of the further shift in representation and thinking still necessary to balance uneven gender dynamics.

Berkshire cut its IBM stake 32 percent in the third quarter to about 37 million shares worth $5.37 billion from 54.1 million shares worth $8.32 billion, according to a Tuesday regulatory filing detailing its U.S.-listed stock holdings. The IBM share stake has fallen by 54 percent since the end of 2016, when Berkshire owned roughly 81 million shares for which it paid about $13.8 billion. During the quarter, Berkshire also boosted its stake in Apple Inc (AAPL.O) 3 percent to 134.1 million shares worth $20.7 billion, and became Bank of America Corp’s (BAC.N) largest shareholder by exercising warrants for 700 million shares. IBM, whose full name is International Business Machines Corp, accounted for most of the stock sales that Buffett and his deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler made in the quarter. In May, Buffett revealed he had begun selling IBM, telling CNBC he did not value Big Blue as highly as he did six years earlier when he started buying. “IBM is a big strong company, but they’ve got big strong competitors, too,” he said. The IBM investment had been viewed as a surprise, given the 87-year-old Buffett’s resistance to investing in technology companies and businesses he found harder to understand.

518,IBM,Amazon sells off China cloud assets as tough new rules bite,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is selling off the hardware from its public cloud business in China, amid tightening regulation over online data that is creating a hurdle for technology firms operating in the world’s second-largest economy. Beijing Sinnet Technology Co Ltd, Amazon’s China partner, said in a filing late on Monday that it would buy the U.S. firm’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) public cloud computing unit in China for up to 2 billion yuan ($301.2 million). “In order to comply with Chinese law, AWS sold certain physical infrastructure assets to Sinnet,” an AWS spokesman said on Tuesday, adding AWS would still own the intellectual property for its services worldwide. “‎We’re excited about the significant business we have in China and its growth potential.” Chinese regulators are tightening rules on foreign data and cloud services, implementing new surveillance measures and increasing scrutiny of cross-border data transfers. Laws that came into effect in June require firms to store data locally. “This move is mostly around regulatory compliance,” said Charlie Dai, Beijing-based analyst at Forrester Research. He added the move was necessary for AWS to build up its other business areas in the market. AWS has a separate hardware venture in partnership with the Ningxia provincial government in China’s northwest. Amazon said on its website that its public cloud services in the country are exclusively managed by Sinnet. Amazon’s cloud business in China already faced tougher rules due to China’s tight internet controls. In August, Sinnet told customers it would shut down VPNs and other services on its networks that allow users to circumvent China’s so-called Great Firewall system of censorship, citing direct instructions from the government. The move casts a shadow over similar foreign ventures in the country. Microsoft Corp, Oracle Corp and IBM Corp are also facing tough new regulatory challenges in localizing their data storage units.  Global firms in China, including Apple Inc, have this year transferred data to Chinese ventures overseen by local authorities. Microsoft operates its Azure cloud services unit in partnership with China-based 21Vianet Group. “We expect other foreign players, such as Oracle and IBM, will also ensure regulatory compliance as long as they want to provide public cloud services in China,” said Dai. Microsoft, Oracle and IBM did not immediately respond to request for comment on Tuesday.  Cloud services have become a crowded and competitive field in China in recent years, with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd’s cloud unit opening over a dozen overseas data centers since 2016.

524,IBM,IBM urged to avoid working on 'extreme vetting' of U.S. immigrants,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A coalition of rights groups launched an online petition on Thursday urging IBM Corp to declare that it will not develop technology to help the Trump administration carry out a proposal to identify people for visa denial and deportation from the United States. IBM and several other technology companies and contractors, including Booz Allen Hamilton, LexisNexis and Deloitte [DLTE.UL], attended a July informational session hosted by immigration enforcement officials that discussed developing technology for vetting immigrants, said Steven Renderos, organizing director at petitioner the Center for Media Justice.  President Donald Trump has pledged to harden screening procedures for people looking to enter the country, and also called for “extreme vetting” of certain immigrants to ensure they are contributing to society, saying such steps are necessary to protect national security and curtail illegal immigration.  The rights group said the proposals run counter to IBM’s stated goals of protecting so-called “Dreamer” immigrants from deportation. Asked about the petition and whether it planned to work to help vet and deport immigrants, an IBM spokeswoman said the company “would not work on any project that runs counter to our company’s values, including our long-standing opposition to discrimination against anyone on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation or religion.” The petition is tied to a broader advocacy campaign, also begun Thursday, that objects to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Extreme Vetting Initiative. In an Oct. 5 email seen by Reuters, Christopher Padilla, IBM’s vice president of government affairs, cited the company’s opposition to discrimination in response to an inquiry about the vetting program from the nonprofit group Open Mic. Padilla said the meeting IBM attended was only informational and it was “premature to speculate” whether the company would pursue business related to the Extreme Vetting Initiative. Booz Allen Hamilton, LexisNexis and Deloitte did not immediately respond when asked about the campaign, which also highlighted their attendance at the July meeting. ICE wants to use machine learning technology and social media monitoring to determine whether an individual is a “positively contributing member of society,” according to documents published on federal contracting websites. More than 50 civil society groups and more than 50 technical experts sent separate letters on Thursday to the Department of Homeland Security saying the vetting program as described was “tailor-made for discrimination” and contending artificial intelligence was unable to provide the information ICE desired. Opponents of Trump’s policies ranging from immigration to trade have been pressuring IBM and other technology companies to avoid working on proposals in these areas from the Republican president’s administration.  Shortly after the presidential election last year, for example, several internet firms pledged that they would not help Trump build a data registry to track people based on their religion or assist in mass deportations. IBM is among dozens of technology companies to join a legal briefing opposing Trump’s decision to end the “Dreamer” program that protects from deportation about 900,000 immigrants brought illegally into the United States as children. “While on the one hand they’ve expressed their support for Dreamers, they’re also considering building a platform that would make it easier to deport them,” Renderos said. CREDO, Daily Kos, and Color of Change also organized the petition.

537,IBM,"Maersk, IBM to launch blockchain-based platform for global trade","COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - The world’s largest container shipping firm A.P. Moller-Maersk is teaming up with IBM to create an industry-wide trading platform it says can speed up trade and save billions of dollars. The global shipping industry has seen little innovation since the container was invented in the 1950s, and cross-border trade still leaves an enormous trail of paperwork and bureaucracy. Success of the platform, which will be made available to the ocean shipping industry around mid-2018, depends on whether Maersk and IBM can convince shippers, freight forwarders, ocean carriers, ports and customs authorities to sign up. Blockchain technology powers the digital currency bitcoin and enables data sharing across a network of individual computers.  It will help manage and track tens of millions of shipping containers globally by digitizing the supply chain process from end to end, the companies said. “The big thing that is missing from this industry to digitize and unleash the potential of the technology is really to create a form of utility that brings standards across the entire ecosystem,” Maersk’s Chief Commercial Officer Vincent Clerc said in an interview. A shipment of refrigerated goods from East Africa to Europe can go through nearly 30 people and organizations and involve more than 200 different communications, according to Maersk. Documentation and bureaucracy can be as much as a fifth of the total cost of moving a container.  “There is a strong push from the end-customer to see this change. We may meet initial resistance form one part of the ecosystem,” Clerc said. “The success of the platform depends on acceptance of all participants.” Customs and port authorities in the United States, Singapore, the Netherlands and China’s Guangdong province have shown interest in using the platform and some other shipping companies are also interested, he said. Maersk, which handles one in seven containers shipped globally, sold off its energy business in 2017 to focus entirely on transportation and logistics.  A cyber attack last year caused some of the biggest-ever disruptions to global shipping, displaying the vulnerability of out-dated communication systems. Maersk’s container and port operations were hit for weeks, as it struggled to bring its IT systems including some 1500 applications back online. The joint venture will be headed by the previous chief of Maersk Line’s North American operations, Michael J. White. Maersk and IBM first announced their cooperation in March.

540,IBM,IBM shares rise after Barclays double upgrade,"(Reuters) - Shares in International Business Machines rose nearly 2 percent on Wednesday, helped by a double-notch upgrade for the company from Barclays ahead of fourth-quarter results on Thursday. Barclays cited a handful of reasons for moving the stock to “overweight” from “underweight”, saying the company could emerge as the next important cloud vendor after Amazon and Microsoft. Out of 24 brokerages covering the stock, eight now have a “buy” or a higher rating; 14 have “hold” and just two “sell.” Shares of IBM gained 1.7 percent at $166.72 in premarket trading. Up to Tuesday’s close, they have gained nearly 12 percent since its last quarterly results on Oct. 17. To counter a slowdown in its legacy hardware and software businesses, IBM has been shifting focus steadily towards data analytics and cloud computing services.     The cloud market is currently dominated by Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure unit - both of which have been growing in double digits as customers scale up their Internet presence. “There is room for another cloud player,” Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz wrote in a note titled “IBM - A New Dawn Emerges” and raised his price target on the stock to $192 from $133. The company, which will report after U.S. markets close on Thursday, trumped Wall Street’s estimates for both profit and revenue in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. While total revenue in that quarter fell 0.4 percent, the 22nd straight quarterly fall, it was also the smallest quarterly drop since the third quarter of 2016. Moskowitz said IBM’s revenue may prove stable or even grow over the next 12-18 months.  He also argued that recently disclosed Spectre and Meltdown processor security flaws could allow IBM to gain share in the mid-range and high-end server market. IBM last month launched Power9 processors, designed for cloud computing and machine learning, to better compete with the likes of Intel and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. A fix for Meltdown, which only affects Intel chips, could lower performance by 30 percent in some cases, pushing customers to look for new processors, potentially lifting both IBM’s market share and revenue, Moskowitz wrote. In a blog post dated Jan. 15, IBM said firmware patches for Power9 platforms were available to fix the security flaws.

541,IBM,"CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-IBM returns to growth, but shares drop after recent rally","(Corrects brokerage name in paragraph 5 to CFRA from MacMillan Communications) Jan 18 (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp’s revenue rose for the first time in 23 quarters and beat analysts’ estimates as the company’s shift into its focus areas such as cloud computing and security services gains traction. IBM’s shares tumbled about 4 percent in extended trading on Thursday. In October, the company had flagged a possible return to growth and since then its stock has gained about 16 percent, including rallying about 10 percent since the start of 2018. “IBM hit their numbers, so I think the reason why shares are down is the shares have been up materially in the last 18 days ... so they’re giving a little bit of that up,” Pivotal Research analyst Lou Miscioscia said. IBM’s quarterly profit, excluding a charge related to the recent U.S. tax overhaul, just edged past analysts’ estimates and the company did not detail the expected impact of the new tax rates on current year’s results. “It’s really the uncertainty of how 2018 shapes out. The big portion of that is tax,” said CFRA analyst David Holt. “Yes it’s going to be headwind but we really don’t know when and how they will be able to recognize those discrete items, and the second one would be the actual growth margin pull.” To counter a slowdown in its legacy hardware and software businesses, IBM has in recent years targeted high-margin “strategic imperatives” such as cloud computing, cybersecurity, mobile and data analytics that flow across its five business units. That has helped its revenue decline slow down in recent quarters and finally turn a corner last quarter. Wall Street expects IBM’s revenue to grow in the current quarter and the next quarter as well, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “Well I think the expectations got ahead of themselves ... they (IBM) have not given 2018 guidance yet, they’re going to give that in the call, so were still waiting for more information,” Miscioscia said. IBM’s “Strategic imperatives” includes the contribution of cloud computing – where firms use a remote network of data centers instead of their own hardware to cut costs. IBM’s cloud business grew 30 percent in the fourth quarter. Revenue from all “strategic imperatives” rose 17 percent. Total revenue increased 3.6 percent to $22.54 billion, beating analysts’ average estimate of $22.06 billion. IBM swung to a loss of $1.05 billion from a year-ago profit of $4.50 billion, due to a $5.5 billion tax reform-related charge. Its adjusted profit of $5.18 per share was a penny above analysts estimates.

544,IBM,Ex-IBM employee from China gets five years prison for stealing code,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former software engineer for IBM in China was sentenced to five years in prison after he pleaded guilty to stealing proprietary source code from the company, prosecutors announced on Friday. Jiaqiang Xu, 32, was sentenced on Thursday by U.S. District Judge Kenneth Karas in White Plains, New York, according to a statement from the office of U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman. Xu pleaded guilty in May 2017 to economic espionage and theft of a trade secret. Leanne Marek, Xu’s attorney, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Xu worked as a systems software developer for International Business Machines Corp from 2010 to 2014, according to a public LinkedIn profile. The company was not identified by name in court documents, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Xu was arrested in December 2015 after meeting with an undercover officer at a White Plains hotel, where authorities said he was recorded saying he used proprietary IBM code to make software to sell to customers, according to prosecutors. He was originally charged with theft of a trade secret. The economic espionage charges were added in a superseding indictment filed last June. Prosecutors said the proprietary computer code Xu stole was related to a so-called clustered file system, which facilitates faster computer performance. Xu, who began working at IBM in China in 2010, had full access to the source code before voluntarily resigning in May 2014, prosecutors said. According to the criminal complaint filed in 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2014 received a report that someone in China was claiming to have access to the code and using it for business ventures, prompting the investigation that led to the arrest.

Eight of the 11 major S&P; sectors were higher, led by a 1.2 percent gain in the consumer staples index and a 0.8 percent rise in consumer discretionary stocks. A disappointing full-year profit forecast from International Business Machines Corp pushed its shares down 3.8 percent, on track for their biggest single-day loss since July. American Express slipped 1.7 percent after posting its first quarterly loss in 26 years and suspending share buybacks for the next six months. “It’s a mixed session,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, while noting the likely fleeting impact of a possible government shutdown if the Senate fails to pass a stopgap spending measure. “Whatever immediate concern the government shutdown brings to the market, I think it will swiftly overcome,” Luschini said.

549,IBM,IBM shares fall on soft profit outlook,"(Reuters) - Shares in International Business Machines fell 2.6 percent on Friday as analysts judged a “disappointing” full-year profit forecast showed that the company would take more time to get back on a path of steady growth. IBM’s results call after U.S. markets closed on Thursday forecast an operating profit of at least $13.80 per share for 2018, compared with $13.80 in 2017 and market expectations of $13.92, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The outlook came on the back of the computing services and hardware firm’s first quarterly revenue growth in six years. “While slight growth is a modest positive, we were largely underwhelmed by IBM’s results, and felt the numbers showed IBM has much more work to do to turn the ship around,” Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner wrote in a client note. IBM’s 3.6 percent revenue growth came mostly from a 71 percent jump in sales of its new Z14 mainframe, which was launched in September, and a 27 percent growth in its cloud business. Several analysts pointed to the traditionally cyclical nature of mainframe revenues, which tend to surge for 2-4 quarters after the launch of a new launch before falling off. But some said the growth since IBM launched its Z14 in September hinted at a different outcome. Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said the new mainframe’s heightened focus on security was attracting more new customers and workloads rather than just upgrades at a time when cyberattacks and chip vulnerability are at the top of buyer’s list of concerns.  A growth in the mainframe business might also improve IBM’s margins. The company’s fourth-quarter adjusted gross margins of 49.5 percent fell short of market expectations of 50.8 percent.  IBM has been moving away from its shrinking hardware and software businesses to what it calls “strategic imperatives,” which includes the contribution of cloud computing – where companies use a remote network of data centers instead of their own hardware to cut costs. Strategic Imperatives grew 14 percent in the quarter. “Looking under the surface, however, it appears that strategic imperatives excluding Systems only grew 6 percent, largely driven by the lack of Cognitive Solutions growth,” Berenberg analyst Josep Bori said. “This is clearly not enough to offset the declining core business,” he said. IBM said it would continue to “maintain a high level of investment” in 2018 as it boosts its capabilities on cloud, mobile, cybersecurity and data analytics. “This quarter was another important step in the right direction with 2018 a major prove me year for IBM to show the turnaround story is viable, which we believe it is, albeit at a snail-like pace,” GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives said.

IBM’s results call after U.S. markets closed on Thursday forecast an operating profit of at least $13.80 per share for 2018, compared with $13.80 in 2017 and market expectations of $13.92, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The outlook came on the back of the computing services and hardware firm’s first quarterly revenue growth in six years. “While slight growth is a modest positive, we were largely underwhelmed by IBM’s results, and felt the numbers showed IBM has much more work to do to turn the ship around,” Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner wrote in a client note. IBM’s 3.6 percent revenue growth came mostly from a 71 percent jump in sales of its new Z14 mainframe, which was launched in September, and a 27 percent growth in its cloud business. Several analysts pointed to the traditionally cyclical nature of mainframe revenues, which tend to surge for 2-4 quarters after the launch of a new launch before falling off. But some said the growth since IBM launched its Z14 in September hinted at a different outcome. Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said the new mainframe’s heightened focus on security was attracting more new customers and workloads rather than just upgrades at a time when cyberattacks and chip vulnerability are at the top of buyer’s list of concerns.  A growth in the mainframe business might also improve IBM’s margins. The company’s fourth-quarter adjusted gross margins of 49.5 percent fell short of market expectations of 50.8 percent.  IBM has been moving away from its shrinking hardware and software businesses to what it calls “strategic imperatives,” which includes the contribution of cloud computing – where companies use a remote network of data centers instead of their own hardware to cut costs. Strategic Imperatives grew 14 percent in the quarter. “Looking under the surface, however, it appears that strategic imperatives excluding Systems only grew 6 percent, largely driven by the lack of Cognitive Solutions growth,” Berenberg analyst Josep Bori said. “This is clearly not enough to offset the declining core business,” he said. IBM said it would continue to “maintain a high level of investment” in 2018 as it boosts its capabilities on cloud, mobile, cybersecurity and data analytics. “This quarter was another important step in the right direction with 2018 a major prove me year for IBM to show the turnaround story is viable, which we believe it is, albeit at a snail-like pace,” GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives said.

552,IBM,"CORRECTED-UPDATE 3-IBM returns to growth after 6 years, but dour forecast hits shares","(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp’s (IBM.N) revenue rose for the first time in 23 quarters, beating analysts’ estimates, but the company warned that a higher tax rate this year would eat into its profit. IBM’s shares, which have rallied 10 percent so far this year on hopes of a strong turnaround in the company’s fortunes, fell more than 3 percent in extended trading on Thursday. The company forecast stable margins and revenue for 2018, buoyed by growth in its newer businesses such as cloud computing and security services. However, IBM forecast an operating profit of at least $13.80 per share for 2018, compared with $13.80 in 2017 and market expectations of $13.92, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “According to Street expectations, we’re already very low for earnings, ... but still, you would have liked to have seen, with the little better revenue trajectory and some positive comments, that would have played in to a nicer number,” Pivotal Research analyst Lou Miscioscia said. IBM forecast a 2018 operating tax rate of 16 percent, plus or minus 2 percentage points, compared with a rate of 12 percent in 2017. “Tax will be a headwind in 2018,” IBM veteran and new Chief Financial Officer James Kavanaugh said on a conference call. Kavanaugh said IBM would continue to “maintain a high level of investment” in 2018 as it boosts its capabilities on its high-margin “strategic imperatives” such as cloud, mobile, cybersecurity and data analytics. That focus, started by Chief Executive Ginni Rometty, has helped IBM counter its faltering legacy hardware and software businesses and slow its revenue declines in recent quarters. The company’s revenue finally rose in the latest fourth quarter, the first year-over-year increase since the first quarter of 2012, just after Rometty became CEO. Revenue from IBM’s cloud business jumped 30 percent in the latest quarter. Revenue from all “strategic imperatives” rose 17 percent. Total revenue increased 3.6 percent to $22.54 billion, beating analysts’ average estimate of $22.06 billion. IBM swung to a loss of $1.05 billion from a year-ago profit of $4.50 billion, due to a $5.5 billion tax reform-related charge. Its adjusted profit of $5.18 per share beat estimates by a penny.

554,IBM,Ex-IBM employee from China gets five years prison for stealing code,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former software engineer for IBM in China was sentenced to five years in prison after he pleaded guilty to stealing proprietary source code from the company, prosecutors announced on Friday. Jiaqiang Xu, 32, was sentenced on Thursday by U.S. District Judge Kenneth Karas in White Plains, New York, according to a statement from the office of U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman. Xu pleaded guilty in May 2017 to economic espionage and theft of a trade secret. Leanne Marek, Xu’s attorney, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Xu worked as a systems software developer for International Business Machines Corp from 2010 to 2014, according to a public LinkedIn profile. The company was not identified by name in court documents, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Xu was arrested in December 2015 after meeting with an undercover officer at a White Plains hotel, where authorities said he was recorded saying he used proprietary IBM code to make software to sell to customers, according to prosecutors. He was originally charged with theft of a trade secret. The economic espionage charges were added in a superseding indictment filed last June. Prosecutors said the proprietary computer code Xu stole was related to a so-called clustered file system, which facilitates faster computer performance. Xu, who began working at IBM in China in 2010, had full access to the source code before voluntarily resigning in May 2014, prosecutors said. According to the criminal complaint filed in 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2014 received a report that someone in China was claiming to have access to the code and using it for business ventures, prompting the investigation that led to the arrest.

563,IBM,IBM lawsuit casts diversity in starkly competitive terms,"(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp’s (IBM.N) insistence in a new lawsuit that its efforts to recruit and maintain a diverse workforce are trade secrets bucks a trend towards transparency and highlights how companies can see the issue in competitive terms, business and legal experts said. Armonk, New York-based IBM on Monday sued its former chief diversity officer, Lindsay-Rae McIntyre, who left for a similar job at Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O). The lawsuit alleges McIntyre violated a one-year non-competition agreement and could disclose IBM’s diversity data and hiring plans. IBM’s stance puts it at odds with trends in the tech industry and broader corporate world towards sharing diversity success stories and best practices, instead seeming to view diversity as a zero-sum game. The lawsuit is unusual because IBM is arguing its diversity data and strategy are economically valuable “trade secrets,” a legal term typically associated with closely guarded formulas like that for Coca-Cola. It appears to be the first company to bring such a lawsuit against a rival over diversity efforts, legal experts said.  IBM cited in its complaint McIntyre’s knowledge and oversight of its plans to hire 50 diverse candidates to executive positions and its development of artificial intelligence-based tools to track the career development of women and minorities at the company.  According to IBM, knowledge of this “highly confidential, proprietary, and competitively sensitive information” would allow Microsoft to compete for the same talent and business from customers that value diversity. Once synonymous with white men in dark suits, IBM created task forces in 1995 to address the issue and soon greatly increased the diversity of its management.  Y-Vonne Hutchinson, an Oakland, California-based diversity consultant and lawyer who works with the tech industry, said IBM has had a legitimate edge over its industry rivals when it comes to diversity. IBM’s tools for reaching it diversity goals could qualify as trade secrets if it can show they are valuable to competitors, said Villanova University law professor Michael Risch. IBM said in a statement that it “has a long history of being recognized for leadership in a diverse and inclusive workplace.”  Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, which is not named in IBM’s lawsuit, said it had no interest in IBM’s confidential information. Russell Beck, a lawyer specializing in trade secrets law, said he was surprised to see IBM make such nakedly economic arguments about diversity, noting that corporations more typically cast their efforts as benefiting society as a whole.  Most large tech firms have long faced criticism for the lack of diversity of their staffs. IBM took a shot at Microsoft in its lawsuit, noting that the latter company has faced “public condemnation and class action litigation” for its struggles to recruit and promote women. Microsoft is seeking to dismiss as without merit a class action alleging pay and promotion discrimination.  Microsoft and IBM both derive much of their revenue from selling software and cloud computing services to big companies, a number of which have said they seek diversity in their vendors and suppliers. Other tech companies have previously argued for the confidentiality of diversity information, though more out of fear of public criticism and litigation than competition, said John Cary Sims, a professor at McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, California. But more have recently embraced transparency. In 2014, Google released diversity data after previously trying to keep it private. Apple and Microsoft have also made their data public. Joelle Emerson, a consultant who has advised Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Airbnb Inc on diversity efforts, criticized IBM’s position.  “If you truly want to build a better industry, sharing learnings is actually a really helpful part of that,” she said. “Ultimately, a more diverse tech industry benefits every company within that industry.” ",2152018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ibm-microsoft-data-analysis/ibm-lawsuit-casts-diversity-in-starkly-competitive-terms-idUSKCN1FY38Z
564,IBM,Major firms learning to adapt in fight against start-ups: IBM,"BARCELONA (Reuters) - Major corporations are learning to defend against start-ups that threaten their business models, hitting back by adopting the disruptors’ playbook, according to a survey of top executives by computer services firm IBM. The proportion of executives who thought competitors were set to flood into their industry has halved from 54 percent to 26 percent compared to two years ago, the broad-based poll of business decision-makers showed. “There’s been a feeling historically that the elephants can’t dance, the incumbents will find it hard to respond and that everyone will be Uber-ed or Airbnb-ed out of existence,”  Mark Foster, senior vice president of IBM Global Business Services, told Reuters in an interview.  “But what we are seeing is actually there is a limit as to how far that can go.” While some sectors had been hugely disrupted by new digital entrants and some intermediaries pushed out, many of those changes were now being led by existing industry players, he said. Disruption is a catch-all term for the use of digital technology to up-end existing business models, for example Uber’s impact on the taxi industry by using smartphones to connect riders with drivers, and pricing according to demand.  But just 27 percent of the executives surveyed said they were experiencing significant disruption, an unexpected finding given the deluge many predicted, IBM said. Only 23 percent said the big drivers of change were from outside their industries. Digital giants, like Google, Apple and Facebook, continued to concentrate their power in some industries, but according to the executives surveyed they were not leading the disruption, and start-ups were increasingly quiescent, the survey found. Instead, 72 percent said it was the most innovative incumbents who were leading the disruption, including in industries targeted by start-ups such as financial services. IBM said the incumbents had become better at spotting and acquiring nascent disruptors. They had also realized the need to find partners, even sharing physical assets and people with them, to acquire new skills. They are investing in the technologies that facilitate the sharing of data across organizations - such as the Internet of Things, which bridges physical and digital assets, and blockchain. “Disruption hasn’t gone underground,” IBM said in its report released before the start of the mobile industry’s biggest event, the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.  “Instead, it’s emerging as a capability incumbents are ready to embrace.” IBM surveyed 12,854 top executives, such as chief executives and finance directors, from 112 countries for its report. “Who Says Elephants Can’t Dance” was the title of the memoir of 1990s era IBM CEO Lou Gerstner, who is credited with bringing the company back from a near-death experience by shifting it into software and services and exiting most hardware businesses.

576,IBM,IBM joins group building a blockchain-based global identity network,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp has joined a private, non-profit organization called Sovrin Foundation that is seeking to build a global decentralized identity system based on blockchain technology. The blue-chip U.S. computing company will join the non-profit as a “founding steward,” dedicating hardware, security, and network capacity to help create a digital identity network for individuals and businesses, Sovrin foundation chair Phil Windley told Reuters in an interview on Thursday. Other international IT firms are already taking part, led by Deutsche Telekom’s research and innovation unit Telekom Innovation laboratories, Sovrin said. “The way we live and work online is quite different from the physical world,” Windley said. “By creating a global digital identity system, Sovrin is trying to make the online world as authentic and as interactive as the physical world.”  Sovrin’s identity network uses distributed ledger technology, or blockchain, to enable the secure exchange of cryptographically-signed credentials to prove an owner’s  digital identity information. “We believe that the adoption of blockchain is an opportunity for a new trust model to take hold where individuals and organizations can securely share private information and credentials without an intermediary,” Marie Wieck, IBM Blockchain general manager, said in a statement. IBM, which did not give a cost estimate for its contribution, has been active in participating in blockchain initiatives and is keen to remain at the forefront of developments in the fast-moving space. The Sovrin network is currently running with limited capacity, but will be more widely available by mid-2018, Windley said. Sovrin said existing identity systems were flawed, with more than 2.9 billion records compromised from various security incidents across industries in 2017. “These damaging and costly security breaches are a consequence of the internet being developed without a true identity layer,” Sovrin said. “To solve this infrastructure flaw, the Sovrin network was purpose-built to add the missing identity layer to the internet.” The Sovrin network is based on emerging standards from the World Wide Web Consortium that standardizes the format of digitally-signed credentials.

IBM fell 6.2 percent after the company reported quarterly profit margins that fell short of Wall Street expectations. Semiconductor stocks also took a hit, led by Lam Research’s 5 percent drop after what analysts called a disappointing shipment forecast. The S&P; technology index fell about 0.5 percent. Not all results were disappointing. Morgan Stanley rose 3 percent after it reported a 40 percent jump in quarterly profit, driven by its trading business. United Airlines rose 1.6 percent after reporting a rise in profit and CSX Corp jumped 7 percent after the railroad operator topped profit estimates. That helped lift the Dow Jones Transport index by 1.2 percent. Oil prices jumped about 2 percent, lifted by a reported decline in U.S. crude inventories and the risk of supply disruptions. Exxon and Chevron were up about 1.3 percent. S&P; 500 companies are expected to post an 18.6 percent rise in profits in the first quarter, the biggest increase in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters data. Stocks have gained solidly in the past two days after strong results from industry bellwethers as well as positive economic data helped investors turn attention away from geopolitical and trade tensions. At 10:08 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.14 percent at 24,751.47. The S&P; 500 was up 0.02 percent at 2,707.05 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.12 percent at 7,272.62.

A 7.6 percent slump in shares of IBM was the biggest single drag on the benchmark S&P; 500 index, after the company reported profit margins that missed Wall Street expectations. No. 3 U.S. railroad operator CSX Corp jumped 6.3 percent after topping profit estimates. The news lifted shares other railroads and powered a 2.3 percent jump in the Dow Jones Transport index. “There’s a lot of headlines pulling the market in different directions. The most notable is energy prices pulling that sector higher,” said David Joy, chief market strategist, at Ameriprise in Boston. He also cited the sharp decline in IBM’s stock and a drop in financial stocks due to a flattening yield curve in U.S. treasuries. “Earnings and the yield curve are the two biggest influences,” he said, adding that “transports are very strong today which is a very good sign for the economy.” United Airlines gained 6.7 percent and lifted other airline stocks after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by higher fares. At 2:47 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 20.92 points, or 0.08 percent, to 24,765.71, the S&P; 500 gained 6.78 points, or 0.25 percent, to 2,713.17 and the Nasdaq Composite added 29.41 points, or 0.4 percent, to 7,310.51. Trading was choppy with the Dow swinging between positive and negative territory. The S&P; 500 briefly pared gains and the Dow added to losses around 2 p.m. ET after a Federal Reserve report said robust business borrowing, rising consumer spending, and tight labor markets indicated the U.S. economy is on track for continued growth, with trade war risks being the one big outlier. Oil futures settled up 2.9 percent due to a decline in U.S. crude inventories and after sources signaled top exporter Saudi Arabia wants to see crude prices closer to $100 a barrel. The S&P; energy sector was up 2.3 percent. Earnings at the S&P; 500 companies are estimated to grow 19.4 percent in the first quarter, the biggest increase in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters data. “Even though it’s early in the earnings season, what you’re seeing is what folks were hoping — it is in line with expectations,” said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at GlobAlt Investments in Atlanta. “The growth rate is coming in slightly higher as companies report above expectations, but it hasn’t been super high.” Tesla rose 2.4 percent after a report that the company was aiming to ramp up production of Model 3 cars to reach its goal. The CBOE Volatility index was up 0.16 points at 15.41, on track for its first daily increase after closing lower for six days in a row. Lam Research fell 5.6 percent after the chip equipment maker kept its full-year shipment forecast unchanged, which analysts said could imply a slowdown in demand. Other chip stocks including Applied Materials also fell, and the broader Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index was down 0.8 percent.

585,IBM,"IBM first-quarter margins miss estimates, shares fall","(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) posted profit margins that fell short of Wall Street expectations on Tuesday, a sign that its reinvention was taking time. Shares of the technology company fell 6 percent in after-hours trade even as it reported the second quarter of revenue growth after a near six-year streak of declines. IBM has in recent years shifted its focus to higher-margin businesses such as cloud computing, cybersecurity and data analytics, to counter a slowdown in its legacy hardware and software businesses, but the move is not going as fast as some shareholders had hoped. While IBM’s revenue and profit beat expectations, the company’s adjusted gross profit margin fell to 43.7 percent from 44.5 percent a year earlier. The company said the decline in gross margin was mostly due to “significant” one-time charges. On an earnings call with analysts, IBM CFO James Kavanaugh said the company cut costs and took a $610 million charge in the first quarter, though he did not give details. This announcement follows expectations of layoffs as IBM, under its Chief Executive Ginni Rometty, tries to offset declines from its legacy businesses.  “The margins were well below the expectations,” Pivotal Research analyst Lou Miscioscia said. The company said it had a tax benefit of $810 million, due to changes in the U.S tax law. Wedbush Securities analyst Moshe Katri said IBM’s legacy hardware business continuing to weigh on margins. “It’s not necessarily about topline growth; its about profitable growth,” Katri said. In addition, IBM said it continues to expect full-year adjusted earnings per share of at least $13.80, while analysts were expecting more, with the consensus at $13.83, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “We delivered exactly what we said 90 days ago. The $13.80 is an ‘at least’ and it’s up 1 to 2 percent year over year,” Kavanaugh told Reuters in an interview. IBM’s revenue grew 5 percent to $19.07 billion in the quarter with 65 percent growth in sales from security services. Cloud revenue grew 25 percent.  Net profit fell to $1.68 billion, or $1.81 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $1.75 billion, or $1.85 per share, a year earlier.

The Commission, the EU executive, will boost its investment in artificial intelligence by about 70 percent to 1.5 billion euros ($1.83 billion). It wants total private and public investment in AI to reach at least 20 billion euros by the end of 2020 to ensure the bloc retains competitiveness and does not face a brain drain. In 2016 European private investments in AI totalled around 2.4-3.2 billion euros, compared to Asia’s almost 10 billion euros and America’s 18 billion euros. “Just as the steam engine and electricity did in the past, AI is transforming our world,” said Andrus Ansip, Vice-President of the European Commission, on Wednesday. “Today, we are giving a boost to researchers so that they can develop the next generation of AI technologies and applications, and to companies, so that they can embrace and incorporate them.” European countries such as France and Britain have also made AI investment a priority. French President Emmanuel Macron promised 1.5 billion euros of public money for AI in March. The Commission said its 1.5 billion-euro investment ought to trigger an additional 2.5 billion euros from existing public-private partnerships, for example on big data and robotics. To help stimulate investment the Commission also proposed legislation to open up more public sector data for re-use, such as the data held by transport authorities and utilities. The tech industry welcomed the AI initiative while trade unions stressed the need to ensure AI develops in support of human beings rather than in place of them. AI raises questions over the future of work as some types of jobs could be carried out more efficiently by machines. “The European Commission is taking the right approach to AI,” said Liam Benham, Vice President Government and Regulatory Affairs at IBM. “Their strategy is grounded in ethics and a commitment to responsibility, it avoids a premature push to regulate, and its focus on bringing together industry, government and academic expertise is essential in positioning Europe to help shape the AI future.” ($1 = 0.8209 euros) (Reporting by Julia Fioretti, Editing by Mark Heinrich)",4252018,http://www.reuters.com/article/eu-artificialintelligence/update-1-eu-targets-20-billion-euro-investment-in-ai-to-catch-up-with-us-asia-idUSL8N1S26LG

590,IBM,Jewelry companies team up with IBM on blockchain platform,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Gold and diamond companies including Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s (BRKa.N) Richline Group Inc joined with IBM (IBM.N) to develop blockchain technology to track the origin of jewelry and ensure it is ethically sourced, the companies said on Thursday. The joint initiative dubbed TrustChain aims to make it easier for consumers to track diamonds and precious metals through the various steps of the supply chain as they become finished pieces jewelry, the companies said. The technology will initially help track six styles of diamond and gold engagement rings and is expected to be available to consumers by the end of 2018, the companies said. Other firms involved in the initiative include precious metals refiner Asahi Refining, jewelry retailer Helzberg Diamonds, precious metals supplier LeachGarner and third-party verification provider UL.  Blockchain, which first emerged as the system powering cryptocurrency bitcoin, is a shared database that is maintained by a network of computers connected to the internet. Because it makes it easier for multiple parties to jointly create and update tamper-proof records, the firms involved in the project believe it is well suited to securely and efficiently track and prove the origin and ethical sourcing of jewelry. Richline Group had previously attempted to create a similar database using different technology, but the process was still heavily manual and prone to inaccuracies, Mark Hanna, the company’s chief marketing officer, said in an interview. “We were always very enamored with it but there wasn’t the right platform,” Hanna said. “Then along came blockchain.” The TrustChain platform was tested last week to track the provenance of a diamond ring across the supply chain.  Other companies in the industry have started to explore using blockchain technology. Anglo American’s (AAL.L) diamond unit De Beers said in January that it aims to create an industry wide blockchain to track gems each time they change hands starting from the moment they are dug from the ground.  [L8N1PB4GZ] Companies in other sectors have also been seeking to adapt blockchain help simplify and reduce the costs some of their most data processes. Supply chain management is one of the areas where businesses believe blockchain holds the most promise, as it involves numerous parties and is still very manual.

591,IBM,UPDATE 1-UK's TSB Bank calls in IBM to fix IT problems,"* Q1 profit before tax down 39.3 pct * Disruption from system migration * Migration aimed at reducing IT costs (Adds more detail, results details) By Estelle Shirbon and Emma Rumney LONDON, April 26 (Reuters) - Britain’s TSB Bank has called in International Business Machines Corp to help resolve an IT crisis that has left dozens of customers without access to digital services for almost a week, its CEO said on Thursday. Disruption scheduled to end on Sunday rolled on until Thursday morning, with customers still reporting issues via social media. CEO Paul Pester said he would take direct control of the bank’s IT platform to fix the severe problems which stemmed from a planned migration of computer systems onto a new platform over the weekend. “I will take direct control from 8 o’clock (0700 GMT) this morning for our platform, I’ve drafted in a team of global experts from IBM,” Pester said during an interview on BBC Radio 4. “They are reporting to me, directly to me and I will take control of the platform until it gets fixed. I am putting things right.” Pester also said the bank’s customers would not be charged any overdraft fees for the month of April. “I’m very aware that many customers may have used their overdraft in April more than they would have expected to. There will be no overdraft fees or any overdraft charges for any of our customers through April,” he said. The bank had been running on an IT system effectively rented from former parent Lloyds Banking Group, costing TSB hundreds of millions of pounds a year since its takeover by Spain’s Banco Sabadell in 2015. TSB on Thursday reported a 2.3 percent rise in first-quarter operating costs to 207.5 million pounds ($289.32 million), primarily due to an increase in these fees. Profit before tax fell 39.3 percent to 19.3 million pounds, which it said was due to temporary movements in hedging arrangements.
