2,MMM,Industrials could signal slower growth ahead,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturers are entering an period where growth is more muted, profit margins are harder to raise and earnings beats are less common.  The easy money has been made, many analysts and shareholders of U.S. industrial stocks say.  General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Jeff Immelt, whose company reports second-quarter earnings next week, acknowledges that the industrial conglomerate is operating in volatile times.  Demand is tremendous, the company’s chief executive says. “You see it getting better, yet at the same time, there’s more discontent,” Immelt said this week at a sprawling GE factory in South Carolina. “This recovery has been so different from previous recoveries.”  Analysts say industrials are in transition from a  “V-shaped” recovery after recession, when nearly everyone increased sales and profits, to an unpredictable period when some businesses thrive, others lag and picking winners is harder.  “Industrials as a group may be among the first to see their profit margins challenged,” said Keith Goddard, manager of the Capital Advisors Growth Fund, which owns GE, Johnson Controls (JCI.N) and FedEx (FDX.N), among other companies whose fortunes are tied to the business cycle.  “Margins are bumping up against all-time highs,” said Goddard, who favors healthcare stocks. “Don’t go to the industrial space looking for positive earnings surprises.”  Increasing commodity and labor costs will trim profits across corporate America, he said, hitting labor-intensive manufacturers. GE has more than 100,000 workers just in the United States.  Many investors play down the negative effects of the U.S. government debt-ceiling impasse and a cautious, debt-burdened U.S. consumer. Slow growth is not a double-dip recession, they say.  Although the U.S. recovery has stalled by some measures, other large economies are still hungry for heavy machinery, cooling equipment, tools and other industrial goods.  Companies keyed to Brazil, India and China, including 3M (MMM.N), Eaton Corp (ETN.N) and Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N), will again benefit from robust capital spending, much of it funded by governments.  One question earnings season may answer is whether Europe’s debt crisis will affect growth and alter profit expectations. Europe’s problems are overemphasized, said Oliver Pursche, co-manager of the GMG Defensive Beta Fund, which holds shares of Caterpillar (CAT.N), Deere (DE.N) and United Technologies (UTX.N).  Industrial shares have rallied into earnings season. For a graphic, click: r.reuters.com/wes62s “I’m not too worried about earnings this quarter,” Pursche said — but a potential global economic slowdown could damp prospects for corporate profits. “I’m much more concerned about cautionary statements from CFOs and CEOs about the rest of the year. It’s going to be a much more challenging environment.”  Caterpillar could sound a cautious note because of China’s efforts to rein in its economy, he said. China’s leaders have suggested they will again raise interest rates and bank reserve requirements to bring down inflation.  U.S. industrials are among the most globally diverse multinationals, but the U.S. market still accounts for as much as half of their revenue. Recent data offers fodder for both bulls and bears.  U.S. June industrial production data disappointed on Friday, and May was revised lower.  A monthly gauge of factory activity by the Institute of Supply Management rebounded last month from a May slump, easing fears of a broad slowdown.  But construction spending — a key market for companies ranging from Eaton to Ingersoll Rand (IR.N), United Technologies and Tyco TYC.N — has fallen for six straight months to its lowest in a decade.  And a quarterly Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI survey pointed to further growth, but at a slower rate. The poll of financial executives, a leading indicator of manufacturing activity, found a fourth straight decline in sentiment.  Companies whose fiscal years ended in June, including Parker Hannifin (PH.N) and Kennametal (KMT.N), will give initial glimpses into 2012 when they introduce 12-month earnings forecasts. Both are known for starting with conservative profit targets.  Other variables to watch this quarter are how much Japan’s March earthquake hurts companies such as 3M; electrical manufacturers’ ability to offset higher steel and copper costs with pricing; and the impact of a weak U.S. dollar.  Depressed housing and a delayed recovery in non-residential construction could hurt machinery makers and rental companies, as well as makers of air conditioners and components.  Other late-cycle markets, such as power generation equipment and aerospace, are also expected to grow over the next two years after declines in 2009 and 2010, so any sign of whether their rebound has begun will be an area of focus.  Electrical equipment and multi-industry companies are near the end of a beat-and-raise phase of their cycle, said Nomura analyst Shannon O’Callahan.  “You had the big V-shaped snapback against easy comparisons,” he said. “Growth has been abnormally high. We’re entering a maturing part of the cycle.”  Managers will point to moderating growth rates this quarter, with few sounding especially bullish. Corporate crystal balls are as cloudy as anyone else’s, O’Callahan said.  ‘WHITE-KNUCKLE’ BULLS  Enough investors see the glass as half-full that earnings expectations and price-to-earnings ratios have risen this year. Industrial shares .GSPIC are up 7 percent year to date, outperforming the broader market. A few, such as Tyco and SPX SPW.N, have jumped 25 percent or more.  At 16 times this year’s estimated earnings, industrials are more richly valued than the overall S&P 500, but are only slightly above their historical average, according to Goldman Sachs.  Goldman analysts, in a July 10 note, predicted industrial companies would sound a more “constructive” tone about the second half of the year than recent economic numbers suggest. They cited expanding late-cycle markets, the weak dollar, and share buybacks and acquisitions.  Most U.S. industrials will beat Wall Street forecasts by 1 percent or 2 percent, said analyst Brian Langenberg of Langenberg & Co, who calls himself a “white-knuckle” bull.  “I expect bigger beats out of companies levered to energy,” he said, citing Dover (DOV.N), Ametek (AME.N) and Emerson. “Ninety-some-dollar oil makes it worth punching holes in the ground.”  Langenberg said current expectations of double-digit profit growth over the next two years are reasonable.  “We’re not back at peak earnings yet,” he said.

4,MMM,Economic jitters threaten holiday chip cheer,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Makers of chips for TVs, game consoles and other consumer electronics aren’t expecting much for Christmas, but insatiable demand for high-end gadgets like Apple’s iPad will likely deliver some cheer.  Texas Instruments, Intel and Qualcomm are normally busy this time of year churning out microchips for consumer electronics — typically the hottest tickets during the annual holiday season from November to December.  But persistently high U.S. unemployment and the risk of further economic slowdown, along with the danger of a European financial crisis, have soured many manufacturers’ moods, according to a growing chorus of chip executives.  Even blockbuster expectations for smartphones have cooled slightly.  “Wherever we look right now there’s macroeconomic uncertainty,” ARM Holdings Chief Executive Warren East told analysts on a conference call on Tuesday. “There is uncertainty about consumer expenditure.”  Cambridge, England-based ARM, whose chip technology is widely used in smartphones and tablets, warned that an uptick in chip manufacturing typically seen ahead of Christmas might be smaller than normal this year.  “Consumer spending is cautious,” said Longbow Research analyst JoAnne Feeney. “(Product manufacturers) are in a wait-and-see holding pattern. They want to see whether demand materializes before they build more televisions, set-top boxes and cameras.”  Last week, Intel cut its outlook for 2011 PC shipments and said growth would come from China and other emerging markets instead of the United States or Europe.  3M Co said on Tuesday its display and graphics segment fell in the June quarter, reflecting less demand for LCD TVs and a tighter consumer electronics market.  Because many of its products are low-cost, quickly used and sold all over the world, 3M is a barometer of global industrial health.  Texas Instruments said on Monday computing and consumer electronics customers concerned about the economy were ordering fewer chips than usual for this time of year. It said store shelves could fill up later than usual this holiday shopping season.  As well as tough economic times, ripples from Japan’s earthquake in March are still affecting the industry.  Electronics manufacturers that deliberately ordered extra components following the disaster are now less worried about shortages and are beginning to work through their inventories, leading to fewer new orders, said CLSA analyst Srini Pajjuri.  Consumer appetite for Apple’s smartphones is as strong as ever, but growth at competitors like Nokia, Research in Motion and LG Electronics has faltered.  And a slew of tablets meant to compete with the iPad have failed to take off, adding to inventories of chips that had been manufactured in anticipation of higher sales but have gone unused.  “Demand for smartphones and tablets is OK, but it’s not as good as people were thinking,” said MKM Partners analyst Daniel Berenbaum. “Plus smartphones and feature phones have a big headwind in Europe, which is a very important market.”  Smartphone shipments this year will grow about 38 percent, according to market research firm IHS iSuppli. Analysts earlier this year had forecast expansion of around 50 percent.  Shares of Broadcom, which makes Bluetooth and other wireless chips and counts Apple as a key customer, soared 9 percent after the Irvine, California company gave a rosier-than-expected quarterly outlook.  Some investors expect larger wireless chipmaker Qualcomm to supply key chips for Apple’s next iPhone and to continue to increase its content in Apple’s devices.  Qualcomm last week raised its guidance for the current quarter, although Chief Financial Officer William Keitel warned that economic uncertainty was making customers “extra judicious”.  Chipmakers that do their own manufacturing, instead of contracting it out, and that have inventories on hand, may be able to respond in time to any last-minute holiday orders should the outlook for consumer demand improve.  Texas Instruments has said there is still time to ramp up ahead of the year-end shopping season and that its factories will be ready if demand improves.  “Christmas could still come if consumers indicate they’re going to spend, Longbow’s Feeney said.

10,MMM,Consumer markets hurt some industrial earnings,"NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - U.S. industrial companies sounded warning alarms about U.S. consumer spending on Tuesday, citing high unemployment, a depressed housing market and the risk of a U.S. debt default.  Makers of products ranging from television components and restaurant equipment to roofing materials and air conditioners warned of weak consumer markets in the second half of the year. Investors dumped shares of industrials whose earnings disappointed, and even those of companies that met profit expectations, like 3M Co (MMM.N).  3M reported strong demand for industrial products, but sharply lower sales in its display and graphics division. Its shares were down 5.2 percent at $90.15 on the New York Stock Exchange, the biggest drag on the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI,  If U.S. and global economies slow down, cyclical manufacturers may be one of the first sectors where a slowdown will be visible. Near-term profit expectations may come down, said Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau.  “Even with some warning signs and potential economic slowing, we still have high expectations,” Windau said. “You see some signs of weakness. The consumer is the most obvious.”  3M said Japan’s March earthquake had reduced sales and profit margins in its display and graphics division, which makes specialty films for computers and televisions. Lower consumer spending was also a factor.  “The LCD TV business is ... going through one of those down cycles that reflect inventory corrections and, ultimately, a less robust consumer end market,” 3M Chief Executive Officer George Buckley told analysts.  Expectations were fairly high for 3M, said Peter Klein, senior portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management in Cleveland. The company met estimates because of a weaker dollar and a boost from acquisitions.  “Display and graphics was the weak spot, and that’s a consumer item,” Klein said. “That just speaks to the pullback by consumers. It’s not unexpected, but it’s a concern.”  Illinois Tool Works Inc (ITW.N) missed Wall Street estimates and said it expected moderating demand in the second half of the year, sending shares of the maker of restaurant equipment, industrial packaging and products used in construction down 9 percent to $51.87.  “Clearly, housing has not bounced back as expected,” said BB&T Capital Markets analyst Holden Lewis, who said ITW is more reliant on consumer markets than many of its peers. “The broad economy is not as strong as the industrial economy. ITW’s weak performance reflects that composition.”  Emerging markets will continue to drive demand for products needed to build infrastructure, he said, although overall growth rates are moderating as the global economy moves past the initial recovery phase.  A few other manufacturers missed forecasts on Tuesday.  Truck maker Paccar (PCAR.O) lowered its forecast of 2011 industrywide tractor-trailer demand in North America, and its shares fell 10.9 percent to $44.90.  Carlisle Cos Inc’s (CSL.N) profit suffered from high raw material costs. Shares of the maker of roofing materials and food equipment were down 9.8 percent at $43.85.  Earnings at Lennox International (LII.N), which makes furnaces and air conditioners, missed by a wide margin, and its shares fell 9.6 percent to $37.25.  A bright spot in U.S. industrial earnings was Cummins Inc (CMI.N), which credited strong international markets for its profit growth. The diesel engine maker said truck, mining and energy markets remained strong and raised its forecast. Its stock rose 4.7 percent to $111.70.  A wider index of U.S. capital goods companies .GSPI was down 2 percent. The sour mood affected even companies whose earnings came in ahead of expectations, like Pentair (PNR.N), a maker of filtration and electrical systems whose third-quarter profit outlook disappointed.  Warning signs were not limited to industrial names.  On Monday, Texas Instruments TXN.N gave a lukewarm outlook, suggesting back-to-school sales of computers and other electronics would be weaker than normal.  ARM Holdings ARM.L also sounded a note of caution about electronic goods sales for Christmas, overshadowing a better-than-expected second quarter.  And Ford Motor (F.N) trimmed its forecast for industry auto sales in North America even as its profit topped expectations on strong pricing.  Shares of United Parcel Service were down 4.1 percent at $70.99 after a modest earnings beat. The world’s largest package delivery company, whose iconic brown trucks carry some 6 percent of the U.S. economy, said it was cautious about its upcoming peak shipping season.  “We have to get unemployment rates down in this country to get consumer confidence up,” CEO Scott Davis said.  Steel and aluminum companies have reported stronger demand from some industrial sectors, but said profits were still constrained by weakness in residential and nonresidential construction in Europe and North America.  AK Steel Holding Corp (AKS.N) forecast a sharp fall in third-quarter operating earnings. U.S. Steel (X.N), the biggest U.S. steelmaker, also expects a lower third-quarter profit. Shares of both companies fell.  Although earnings from companies affected by consumer spending hinted at a slowdown, other signs suggested shoppers remain resilient. U.S. stocks pared losses as a better-than-expected reading on consumer confidence boosted investor optimism.

13,MMM,Consumer markets hurt some industrial earnings,"NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - Disappointed investors dumped shares of several large U.S. industrial and transport companies after they warned of weak consumer markets, especially in the United States.  3M Co's (MMM.N) earnings met Wall Street forecasts, and the global conglomerate reported strong industrial demand, but also had sharply lower sales in its display and graphics division. Its shares were down 4.8 percent at $90.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, the biggest drag on the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI at midday on Tuesday.  3M’s report was one of several early alarm bells about demand in the second half of 2011, amid persistently high unemployment, a U.S. housing market at multi-year lows, and a political impasse over the debt ceiling.

Corning shares fell nearly 7 percent as it joined other companies in the supply chain, such as ARM Holdings ARM.L and Texas Instruments TXN.N, in raising doubts about the health of the consumer electronics market. Corning makes the liquid crystal display glass used in flat-screen TVs, so it often has an early read on TV sales.   Corning’s finance chief Jim Flaws said consumer electronics manufacturers recognize “that the economies around the world are not growing as fast as people had originally hoped.”  “What you are seeing is the major TV brands like Sony, Samsung, LG are all reducing their forecasts of what will be sold at retail,” Flaws said in an interview.  Consumers, he said, might be spending discretionary income on products other than TV sets or “perhaps just not spending their money at all.”  Earlier this week, 3M’s (MMM.N) chief executive also warned that with consumers spending less, there could be a contraction in the LCD TV market.  While Corning makes glass used in telecommunications, life sciences and the auto industry, its LCD business makes the most profit. Prospects of depressed LCD sales weighed on its share price.  “LCD TVs are going through a secular slowdown and we’re only in the early stages, so it’s only going to get worse,” Ticonderoga Securities analyst Brian White said.Corning lowered its forecast for worldwide glass demand to between 3.3 billion and 3.4 billion square feet this year from 3.5 billion to 3.7 billon square feet.  “The company’s LCD glass outlook is much weaker than our projections,” White said, adding Corning is forecasting the lowest growth rate for glass that he has ever seen. He has a “sell” rating on the stock.  Sales in Corning’s display technologies segment, which includes its LCD glass, fell 9 percent in the second quarter.  Corning lowered its forecast for Gorilla Glass, the scratch-free cover glass mostly used in smartphones and tablets. Corning had bet on TV manufacturers buying resistant product to use as a cover glass on TV screens.  But after only one manufacturer, Sony, signed on, Corning reduced its annual revenue forecast for Gorilla Glass by 20 percent.  In the second quarter, Corning reported a decline in second-quarter profit as it cut its glass prices. Net income fell to $755 million, or 47 cents per share, from $913 million or 58 cents per share, a year earlier.Adjusted for litigation related to an asbestos exposure case, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of 48 cents, beating analysts’ average estimates of 47 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

16,MMM,RPT-WRAPUP 3-Consumer markets hurt some industrial earnings,"  (Repeating July 26 story with no change to text)   * 3M meets forecasts, but display business weak   * 3M CEO says consumers ‘less robust;’ shares fall   * Paccar, ITW, Lennox profits miss   * Engine maker Cummins stock rises on profit beat  (Adds analyst comment, updates share activity)   By Nick Zieminski and Scott Malone   NEW YORK/BOSTON, July 26 (Reuters) - U.S. industrial companies sounded warning alarms about U.S. consumer spending on Tuesday, citing high unemployment, a depressed housing market and the risk of a U.S. debt default.   Makers of products ranging from television components and restaurant equipment to roofing materials and air conditioners warned of weak consumer markets in the second half of the year. Investors dumped shares of industrials whose earnings disappointed, and even those of companies that met profit expectations, like 3M Co (MMM.N).   3M reported strong demand for industrial products, but sharply lower sales in its display and graphics division. Its shares were down 5.2 percent at $90.15 on the New York Stock Exchange, the biggest drag on the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI,   (For a Reuters Insider story, see link.reuters.com/pux72s )   If U.S. and global economies slow down, cyclical manufacturers may be one of the first sectors where a slowdown will be visible. Near-term profit expectations may come down, said Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau.   “Even with some warning signs and potential economic slowing, we still have high expectations,” Windau said. “You see some signs of weakness. The consumer is the most obvious.”   3M said Japan’s March earthquake had reduced sales and profit margins in its display and graphics division, which makes specialty films for computers and televisions. Lower consumer spending was also a factor.   “The LCD TV business is ... going through one of those down cycles that reflect inventory corrections and, ultimately, a less robust consumer end market,” 3M Chief Executive Officer George Buckley told analysts.   Expectations were fairly high for 3M, said Peter Klein, senior portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management in Cleveland. The company met estimates because of a weaker dollar and a boost from acquisitions.   “Display and graphics was the weak spot, and that’s a consumer item,” Klein said. “That just speaks to the pullback by consumers. It’s not unexpected, but it’s a concern.”   Illinois Tool Works Inc (ITW.N) missed Wall Street estimates and said it expected moderating demand in the second half of the year, sending shares of the maker of restaurant equipment, industrial packaging and products used in construction down 9 percent to $51.87. [ID:nN1E76O0WH]   “Clearly, housing has not bounced back as expected,” said BB&T Capital Markets analyst Holden Lewis, who said ITW is more reliant on consumer markets than many of its peers. “The broad economy is not as strong as the industrial economy. ITW’s weak performance reflects that composition.”                         Emerging markets will continue to drive demand for products needed to build infrastructure, he said, although overall growth rates are moderating as the global economy moves past the initial recovery phase.   A few other manufacturers missed forecasts on Tuesday.   Truck maker Paccar (PCAR.O) lowered its forecast of 2011 industrywide tractor-trailer demand in North America, and its shares fell 10.9 percent to $44.90. [ID:nN1E76O1GE].   Carlisle Cos Inc’s (CSL.N) profit suffered from high raw material costs. Shares of the maker of roofing materials and food equipment were down 9.8 percent at $43.85. [ID:nL3E7IQ2W8]   Earnings at Lennox International (LII.N), which makes furnaces and air conditioners, missed by a wide margin, and its shares fell 9.6 percent to $37.25. [ID:nL3E7IQ3AW]   A bright spot in U.S. industrial earnings was Cummins Inc (CMI.N), which credited strong international markets for its profit growth. The diesel engine maker said truck, mining and energy markets remained strong and raised its forecast. [ID:nN1E76P02M] Its stock rose 4.7 percent to $111.70.   A wider index of U.S. capital goods companies .GSPI was down 2 percent. The sour mood affected even companies whose earnings came in ahead of expectations, like Pentair (PNR.N), a maker of filtration and electrical systems whose third-quarter profit outlook disappointed. [ID:nL3E7IQ2XW]   Warning signs were not limited to industrial names.   On Monday, Texas Instruments TXN.N gave a lukewarm outlook, suggesting back-to-school sales of computers and other electronics would be weaker than normal. [ID:nN1E76O15C]   ARM Holdings ARM.L also sounded a note of caution about electronic goods sales for Christmas, overshadowing a better-than-expected second quarter. [ID:nL3E7IQ1LY]   And Ford Motor (F.N) trimmed its forecast for industry auto sales in North America even as its profit topped expectations on strong pricing. [ID:nN1E76P00N]   Shares of United Parcel Service were down 4.1 percent at $70.99 after a modest earnings beat. The world’s largest package delivery company, whose iconic brown trucks carry some 6 percent of the U.S. economy, said it was cautious about its upcoming peak shipping season. [ID:nN1E76P021]   “We have to get unemployment rates down in this country to get consumer confidence up,” CEO Scott Davis said.   Steel and aluminum companies have reported stronger demand from some industrial sectors, but said profits were still constrained by weakness in residential and nonresidential construction in Europe and North America.    AK Steel Holding Corp (AKS.N) forecast a sharp fall in third-quarter operating earnings. U.S. Steel (X.N), the biggest U.S. steelmaker, also expects a lower third-quarter profit. Shares of both companies fell. [ID:nN1E76O15C]   Although earnings from companies affected by consumer spending hinted at a slowdown, other signs suggested shoppers remain resilient. U.S. stocks pared losses as a better-than-expected reading on consumer confidence boosted investor optimism. [ID:nLDE76P1DP]  (Additional reporting by Steve James, A.

17,MMM,RPT-Economic jitters threaten holiday chip cheer," (Repeats to additional readers)   * Holiday chip demand threatened by slow economy   * Seasonal uptick could be small   * Smartphone expectations come down   By Noel Randewich   SAN FRANCISCO, July 26 (Reuters) - Makers of chips for TVs, game consoles and other consumer electronics aren’t expecting much for Christmas, but insatiable demand for high-end gadgets like Apple’s (AAPL.O) iPad will likely deliver some cheer.   Texas Instruments TXN.N, Intel (INTC.O) and Qualcomm (QCOM.O) are normally busy this time of year churning out microchips for consumer electronics — typically the hottest tickets during the annual holiday season from November to December.   But persistently high U.S. unemployment and the risk of further economic slowdown, along with the danger of a European financial crisis, have soured many manufacturers’ moods, according to a growing chorus of chip executives.   Even blockbuster expectations for smartphones have cooled slightly.   “Wherever we look right now there’s macroeconomic uncertainty,” ARM Holdings ARM.L Chief Executive Warren East told analysts on a conference call on Tuesday. “There is uncertainty about consumer expenditure.”   Cambridge, England-based ARM, whose chip technology is widely used in smartphones and tablets, warned that an uptick in chip manufacturing typically seen ahead of Christmas might be smaller than normal this year.   “Consumer spending is cautious,” said Longbow Research analyst JoAnne Feeney. “(Product manufacturers) are in a wait-and-see holding pattern. They want to see whether demand materializes before they build more televisions, set-top boxes and cameras.”   Last week, Intel cut its outlook for 2011 PC shipments and said growth would come from China and other emerging markets instead of the United States or Europe.   3M Co (MMM.N) said on Tuesday its display and graphics segment fell in the June quarter, reflecting less demand for LCD TVs and a tighter consumer electronics market.   Because many of its products are low-cost, quickly used and sold all over the world, 3M is a barometer of global industrial health.   Texas Instruments said on Monday computing and consumer electronics customers concerned about the economy were ordering fewer chips than usual for this time of year. It said store shelves could fill up later than usual this holiday shopping season.   As well as tough economic times, ripples from Japan’s earthquake in March are still affecting the industry.   Electronics manufacturers that deliberately ordered extra components following the disaster are now less worried about shortages and are beginning to work through their inventories, leading to fewer new orders, said CLSA analyst Srini Pajjuri.   Consumer appetite for Apple’s smartphones is as strong as ever, but growth at competitors like Nokia NOK1V.HE, Research in Motion RIM.TO and LG Electronics  (066570.KS) has faltered.   And a slew of tablets meant to compete with the iPad have failed to take off, adding to inventories of chips that had been manufactured in anticipation of higher sales but have gone unused.   “Demand for smartphones and tablets is OK, but it’s not as good as people were thinking,” said MKM Partners analyst Daniel Berenbaum. “Plus smartphones and feature phones have a big headwind in Europe, which is a very important market.”   Smartphone shipments this year will grow about 38 percent, according to market research firm IHS iSuppli. Analysts earlier this year had forecast expansion of around 50 percent.   Shares of Broadcom BRCM.O, which makes Bluetooth and other wireless chips and counts Apple as a key customer, soared 9 percent after the Irvine, California company gave a rosier-than-expected quarterly outlook.   Some investors expect larger wireless chipmaker Qualcomm to supply key chips for Apple’s next iPhone and to continue to increase its content in Apple’s devices.   Qualcomm last week raised its guidance for the current quarter, although Chief Financial Officer William Keitel warned that economic uncertainty was making customers “extra judicious”.   Chipmakers that do their own manufacturing, instead of contracting it out, and that have inventories on hand, may be able to respond in time to any last-minute holiday orders should the outlook for consumer demand improve.   Texas Instruments has said there is still time to ramp up ahead of the year-end shopping season and that its factories will be ready if demand improves.   “Christmas could still come if consumers indicate they’re going to spend, Longbow’s Feeney said.

20,MMM,Analysis: Shaky economy has companies wary of spending,"BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Weakening demand in the United States and Europe has spooked some in corporate America, prompting big companies to throttle back their spending just as U.S. government looks for ways to cut its own outlays.  That new wave of fears is threatening to choke off a fledgling resurgence in capital investment by big companies — one of the few areas where economic activity was growing.  Chief executives and investors have been bombarded by a wave of bad economic news over the past few days, including a report that U.S. gross domestic product grew at a weaker than expected rate in the first half of the year and word on Wednesday that the rate of layoffs had picked up in July.  “We’re looking at slower growth,” said David Farr, CEO of U.S. manufacturer Emerson Electric Co, which recently warned that its order rates slowed in the past two months. “I can’t tell you right now what the second half will be, I can’t tell you what 2012’s going to be, so don’t bother to ask.”  Still, that uncertainty is not stopping the blunt-talking executive from acting. He is already looking for ways to limit the St. Louis-based company’s spending — rather than planning to boost its budget by 5 percent next year, Farr now aims to increase outlays by just 3 to 4 percent.  He is not the only one sounding a cautious tone.  Sergio Marchionne, CEO of Chrysler and Fiat SpA, said the uncertain recovery in consumer demand for cars, also cited by General Motors Co, is making automakers wary.  “People are still very reluctant to make long-term commitments to R&D and capital because of the uncertainty,” he told reporters at an industry conference on Wednesday.  Corporate spending is no better: Earlier this week SPX Corp, a maker of industrial components, surprised investors with a far weaker than expected third-quarter profit forecast, saying it was counting on a robust fourth quarter to hit its full-year target. That followed word last week from Juniper Networks Inc that the private sector and U.S. government are delaying purchases of network equipment.  The nervousness could dampen what had been a recent resurgence in corporate investment. Companies boosted their capital spending by about 21 percent in the first quarter and kept up a similar pace in the second quarter, putting them on a track for their biggest-spending year since 2006, according to a Reuters study of 3,153 U.S. companies.  That growth, however, lags the increase in money spent on stock buybacks and takeovers, which both rose more than 60 percent in the first half of 2011.  Engineering company Foster Wheeler AG also said its U.S. clients are holding off on committing to big construction projects, over worries about the economy.  “The delays are due to client concerns about the macro environment, specifically the political and economic uncertainties,” said interim CEO Umberto della Sala.  The $2.1 trillion deficit-reduction plan reached in Washington this week spared the United States from defaulting on its $14.3 trillion debt, but raised questions on what spending would be cut, which in turn weighed on shares of companies that do everything from running nursing homes to building fighter planes.  “Where is the growth going to come from?” said Michael Goodman, director of economic and public policy research at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth. “It’s not going to come from the private side and it doesn’t appear like it’s going to come from the public side. That does appear like a recipe for sluggish growth at best.”  Sluggish growth is just what the United States has seen this year, with GDP up 0.4 percent in the first quarter and 1.3 percent in the second.  Even companies that are spending are not necessarily making their investments in the United States.  “Our capex is increasingly shifting toward international markets and fast-growing developing economies in particular,” said David Meline, chief financial officer at 3M Co.  The company expects its total capital spending to rise this year by about 27 percent, to a range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion, and plans to continue to raise that budget next year, in line with revenue growth.  Corporate caution will only represent a further weight on the economy, which has seen consumer spending depressed by a stubbornly high unemployment rate that has held near or above 9 percent for most of the past two years.  Companies have become increasingly unwilling to part with their cash over the past year, building up $1.9 trillion in cash and short-term instruments at the end of the first quarter, according to Federal Reserve data.  “You’ll see firms hanging on to their cash even more than they already are,” said Lee Pinkowitz, associate professor of finance in Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business. “Companies may start rushing to issue debt, to lock in, not because they have projects but because they’re going to hold that cash.”  The new caution raises worry in some economists’ minds that the United States could slip back into recession.  “I’m not sure we’re going to head back down into recession, but I would say the probability is higher now than it was a few months back,” said Robert Murphy, a professor of economics at Boston College, who served as a White House adviser on the economy during the Clinton administration.  If the nation does slip back into recession, it could be some time before investors know, Murphy said. The United States was a full year into the last recession, which ran from December 2007 through June 2009, before the National Bureau of Economic Research officially declared its beginning.  “The good news for the president is we probably won’t know until after the election, the way these things often get called,” Murphy said.

23,MMM,BUY OR SELL-U.S. industrial shares show profit pessimism," * Industrial stocks have lagged broader market   * Companies may soon start lowering outlooks   * Executives, some analysts still see strong growth   By Nick Zieminski   Sept 14 (Reuters) - U.S. industrial stocks are flashing yellow, having lost a fifth of their value in the last two months in what some describe as a warning that another recession is looming.   The market is suggesting U.S. manufacturing multinationals may be poised to cut earnings estimates or ratchet down expectations for next year, as slowing economies and uncertainty over any resolution of Europe’s debt problems raise more questions about demand for high-value capital goods.   The Standard & Poor's Capital Goods index .GSPIC has fallen more than 20 percent since mid-July, when General Electric Co (GE.N), Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), 3M Co (MMM.N) and other big manufacturers began reporting second-quarter results. That is a steeper decline than the broad S&P 500 index's .SPX 13 percent slide.   Even as the shares have sunk, management of top U.S. manufacturers and the Wall Street analysts that follow them have largely stood by profit targets that call for double-digit-percentage growth in the second half of the year.   Industrial distributor W.W. Grainger (GWW.N) said on Monday that August sales rose at the same pace as in July. Danaher Corp’s (DHR.N) chief executive officer said last week that he felt “very good” about the conglomerate’s third-quarter forecast.   This month will determine who is right — bullish managers or skittish investors — since September accounts for up to 45 percent of third-quarter sales. The companies will begin reporting their results in October.   Nomura analyst Shannon O’Callaghan cut 2012 earnings estimates for a dozen manufacturing giants, including GE, Danaher, 3M and Tyco International TYC.N, to an average of 9 percent below consensus.   For some companies, such as Ingersoll Rand (IR.N) and SPX Corp SPW.N, his estimates are 17 percent below the Wall Street average. O’Callaghan also lowered the companies’ share-price targets. [ID:nWNAB5908]   His reasoning? Profit warnings are coming.   “Further slowing has yet to manifest itself via guidance cuts ... but will likely do so in coming months,” O’Callaghan said in a note to clients, adding price-to-earnings ratios have come down in anticipation of such cuts.   O’Callaghan said the stocks could do well if recession risks erode, but “that is still a big ‘if’ right now.”   Headwinds to 2012 forecasts include the European debt crisis; political gridlock in Washington; and the possibility that China’s efforts to curb inflation could slow its economy too much.   Stocks are pricing in not just a slowdown but an actual decline in earnings. Cooper Industries CBE.N, Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), Dover Corp (DOV.N) and Eaton Corp (ETN.N) are trading at 10 or less times next year’s estimated earnings, only slightly above their multiples in the last recession.   Only financial stocks have fallen more steeply so far this year. Industrials were the second-best-performing sector in 2010 as the global recovery gained speed, but that recovery is increasingly in doubt, according to Standard & Poor’s.   Bulls point to healthy demand from markets like utilities and commercial aerospace. Home prices are stabilizing, and credit remains accessible to large companies. Some late-cycle markets, such as nonresidential construction, have yet to recover, but are unlikely to fall much further.   Some economists expect U.S. economic growth to accelerate next year. An index of U.S. factory activity in August came in above estimates and remains at a level that indicates expansion.   Still, electrical and multi-industry stocks trade at a discount to the S&P 500 index based on expected 2012 profits for the first time since the 2008-2009 recession: evidence that investors have lost confidence in Wall Street estimates.   “It’s goblins in people’s heads right now,” said analyst Nick Heymann of William Blair & Co. “The fear factor is casting a far, far bigger shadow on valuations than the fundamentals.”   Most companies are likely to meet forecasts when they report third-quarter results, said Vertical Research Partners analyst Jeff Sprague. But they may start to talk down expectations about the fourth quarter and beyond while giving 2012 forecasts that are below Wall Street expectations.   “It feels like we’ve discounted a full-fledged recession, and the odds are that we might have some kind muddle-through, slow growth,” Sprague said. “There could be a pretty significant bounce-back if it turns out September was OK.”  (Reporting by Nick Zieminski in New York; Additional reporting by Scott Malone in Boston; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)   ",9142011,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-manufacturing-outlook/buy-or-sell-u-s-industrial-shares-show-profit-pessimism-idUSS1E78C0GC20110914

25,MMM,Employee reward site raises $24.5 millon from Sequoia,"(Reuters) - Prominent Silicon Valley venture capital firm Sequoia Capital is wading into the near $50-billion employee rewards market with its $24.5 million Series C round of financing of online San Francisco-based company Achievers.  The announcement on Wednesday by the venture capital heavyweight signals a heightened interest in the space that Sequoia partner Alfred Lin said is “highly fragmented” and lacks a dominant player.  “We want to be an investor in the most interesting companies of tomorrow and we felt like this would be a company for the ages,” said Lin, who will take a seat on Achievers’ board of directors.  Sequoia has had a long history in backing technology companies such as Apple (AAPL.O) and Google (GOOG.O).  The round also included previous investors in Boston-based GrandBanks Capital and Toronto, Canada-based firms JLA Ventures and the Ontario Venture Capital Fund.  Achievers has now raised $38 million since CEO Razor Suleman founded the company in 2002 in Toronto. Formerly named I Love Rewards, the company, which has 150 employees, has since expanded to Boston and San Francisco and Suleman said the latest funding will be put toward hiring in all three markets and extensive marketing of the product.  Suleman said the employee rewards and recognition industry has shifted away from the traditional model of giving workers gifts in the form of watches at the end of an extended period of service.  Now he said it’s about employers tapping into the more “intrinsic” motivations and ambitions of employees through regular performance and engagement metrics and rewarding them accordingly.  One way it does this is through its “social recognition” platform that tracks and rewards employees with points that can be redeemed for gifts from companies like Apple (AAPL.O), Visa (V.N) and Expedia (EXPE.O).

The Chapter 11 filing comes five years after Graceway was founded by GTCR Golder Rauner, a leading private equity firm, and current Chief Executive Jefferson Gregory.   Galderma is a joint venture between Switzerland’s Nestle SA NESN.VX and France’s L’Oreal SA (OREP.PA).   Graceway’s products include Aldara, a topical medicine for the face and scalp to treat a skin patch condition called actinic keratosis. It acquired the rights to sell Aldara when it paid $875 million in January 2007 for 3M Co’s (MMM.N) North and South American pharmaceuticals business.   But Aldara sales fell to $52.2 million in 2010 from $320.8 million a year earlier after litigation cost Graceway its exclusive right to sell the product, Executive Vice President Gregory Jones said in a court filing.   The sales drop was the main factor behind the Bristol, Tennessee-based company’s bankruptcy filing, while too much debt and the global recession were also factors, he said.   Other Graceway products include Zyclara, which also treats actinic keratosis, and treatments for eczema and genital warts.   Graceway had about $872 million of debt as of Sept. 28, and less than $500 million of assets, papers filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware, show.   The company also plans to conduct a concurrent receivership proceeding in Canada.   A sale to Galderma is subject to higher bids at a court-supervised auction, and requires court approval.   Graceway expects a sale to close by the end of January.   Lazard is its financial adviser, Alvarez & Marsal is its restructuring adviser, and Latham & Watkins is its law firm.

28,MMM,"Ingersoll Rand cuts profit view, shares tumble","(Reuters) - Ingersoll Rand Plc (IR.N) cut its profit forecast for the rest of the year on Friday, blaming weak demand in North America for residential heating and cooling systems and commercial security products.  The warning sent shares of the U.S. maker of air conditioners and locks down as much as 18 percent to their lowest level in more than two years, and came as Wall Street is getting nervous that corporate profit growth may be slowing.  Analysts, on average, look for the companies that make up the widely watched Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX to report 13.5 percent earnings growth in the third quarter, down from an average forecast of 17 percent as of July 1.  “You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to know that residential markets were not going to be doing anything substantial for a company’s results,” said Eli Lustgarten, an analyst at Longbow Research. “This (Ingersoll forecast) is a warning sign, to show you that improving profits and beating guidance is not going to be easy for a while.”  Electric products maker Cooper Industries Plc CBE.N also cited weak demand for products used in residential and commercial buildings when it cut its third-quarter forecast earlier this month.  Ingersoll’s troubles are twofold: The second-half recovery in consumer demand for air conditioning and security systems that it expected has not materialized, and consumers who have replaced air conditioners or heaters have opted for lower-priced units, rather than the more profitable, and more expensive, high-efficiency systems, analysts said.  The Ingersoll cut could be the start of a wave of earnings warnings in the industrial sector, which is grappling with weak demand in the United States and Europe, one analyst said.  “My feeling is this is the first of many in the industrial space in the next couple of weeks,” said Eric Landry, an analyst at Morningstar in Chicago.  Ingersoll, which is headquartered in Davidson, North Carolina, but incorporated in Dublin, generates 67 percent of its revenue in North America. That makes it more reliant on its home market than bigger U.S. industrials, including General Electric Co (GE.N), United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) and Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), which have used growth in Asia and the Middle East to offset sluggish U.S. spending.  Ingersoll shares were down $4.21, or 13 percent, at $27.75 in early-afternoon trading, the sharpest decline on the New York Stock Exchange. They touched a low of $26.13 earlier in the session. The earlier low marked Ingersoll’s biggest one-day drop since the 1987 “Black Monday” stock market crash.  The Standard & Poor’s capital-goods industry index .GSPIC was down 1.9 percent, and U.S. stocks were broadly lower as investors worried the global economy is slowing.  Ingersoll, which makes Schlage locks and Trane air conditioners, cut its third-quarter profit forecast to a range of 77 cents to 80 cents per share. At its midpoint, that is down 12.8 percent from the company’s prior forecast and would represent a decline from 80 cents per share in the year-earlier third quarter.  Analysts were expecting the company to post a profit of 91 cents a share for the quarter before special items, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  For the year, Ingersoll now expects earnings of $2.70 to $2.80 per share. At its midpoint, that is down 8 percent from prior guidance and below the $2.96 per share Wall Street had looked for.  The Ingersoll warning did not catch investors entirely unawares. Nomura analyst Shannon O’Callaghan earlier this month cut his third-quarter forecasts on a range of big industrials, including Ingersoll, GE, SPX Corp SPW.N and 3M Co (MMM.N), warning that he expected forecast cuts.  Not all the recent news from the sector has been as bleak.

30,MMM,"3M, U.S. manufacturers sound warning on Europe","(Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer 3M Co (MMM.N) sounded a warning on Tuesday, telling Wall Street that Europe’s brewing debt crisis and weakening consumer demand were taking a toll on profit. The maker of products ranging from Post-It notes to films used in flat-panel televisions was not alone in calling out Europe, with Illinois Tool Works Inc (ITW.N) and Paccar Inc (PCAR.O) also citing worsening demand from the continent, where investors worry that sovereign debt default could rattle the banking system. 3M on Tuesday became the first blue-chip U.S. manufacturer to miss third-quarter earnings forecasts. 3M is typically quicker to feel the effects of a downturn than General Electric Co (GE.N) or United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), whose bigger-ticket items are ordered longer before delivery and which generate a lot of revenue maintaining their jet engines, electric turbines and elevators. “The quarter turned out to be a very different one than what we expected,” 3M Chief Executive George Buckley told analysts on a conference call. “Cause No. 1 was worries about European sovereign debt and the European economy. Cause No. 2 was the rapid contraction of the electronics end markets.” In particular, the St. Paul, Minnesota-based company said weak consumer electronics sales hurt its results. Its shares fell 5 percent to $78.11 in morning trading, making it the biggest drag on the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI. Paccar, which makes Peterbilt, Kenworth and DAF heavy trucks, also raised a red flag on Europe. “Recent euro zone economic uncertainties have resulted in lower industry truck orders,” Paccar CEO Mark Pigott said in a statement. Even with these worries, top executives at U.S. companies said they believe the nation’s economy is not headed back into recession. United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) CEO Scott Davis told investors on Tuesday he believes the U.S. economy has stabilized, while 3M Chief Financial Officer David Meline said he did not expect a double-dip recession. With a little more than two months to go in 2011, some industrials took an opportunity on Tuesday to revise their forecasts for the rest of the year. Diesel engine maker Cummins Inc (CMI.N) cited global economic uncertainty, including efforts by the governments of India and China to fight inflation, in pulling back its full-year revenue and profit margin forecasts. The Columbus, Indiana-based company said it now expects full-year sales of $17.5 billion to $18 billion; previously it forecast $18 billion. Analysts, on average, look for $18.08 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The report, which came on a day the company posted better-than-expected third-quarter revenue, amounted to a fourth-quarter guidance cut, one analyst said. “Third-quarter revenue was in line, so you have a weaker fourth-quarter number coming,” said Eli Lustgarten, analyst at Longbow Research. Cummins shares fell 5 percent to $93.79 on the New York Stock Exchange. 3M cut its profit forecast for the year, saying it now expects $5.85 to $5.95 per share, down about 4 percent at its midpoint from its previous view and well below the $6.16 analysts had expected. ITW, which makes restaurant equipment, industrial packaging and car and truck components, reported profit that topped analysts’ forecasts. It set a fourth-quarter profit forecast of 86 cents to 94 cents per share, which at its midpoint was a penny shy of Wall Street expectations. ITW shares were down 4 percent at $46.21 and Paccar eased less than 1 percent to $42.17, with the Standard & Poor’s capital goods industry index .GSPIC falling 2 percent.

31,MMM,"UPDATE 4-Europe, electronics hit 3M earnings; stock slumps","* Q3 EPS $1.52 vs Wall Street view $1.61 * Sees softness in electronics, customer inventories * Cuts 2011 earnings forecast by 30 cents per share * Shares down 5.3 percent in midday trading By John D. Stoll Oct 25 (Reuters) - A weak consumer electronics market and aftershocks from Europe’s debt crisis pulled 3M Co’s  quarterly earnings well below expectations, sending company shares down more than 5 percent. 3M also lowered its full-year earnings forecast, citing expectations for slower economic growth and lower demand. The company predicted moderate sales growth for 2012. “The business environment remains challenging, as the economic softening that we experienced late in the second quarter continued into the third,” Chief Executive George Buckley said. Buckley, speaking on a conference call, said growing concern over the debt crisis in Europe has impacted exchange rates, disproportionately hitting 3M due to its exposure to international markets. He also noted that the consumer electronics sector continues to sag, but expressed optimism concerning that market’s ability to snap back to health. Company executives expressed concern that the malaise in consumer electronics may spill over into adjacent sectors, such as automotive electronics, but see little indication to date. Despite weakness in key pockets of its business, 3M enjoyed continued growth for industrial, security, transportation and healthcare products during the quarter. Do-it-yourself product growth — spurred by consumers tightening their belts — also helped the company. Investors reacted harshly to the earnings, with shares of 3M — a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average — trading down about 5 percent on the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday. Sterne Agee downgraded the stock to neutral, citing concerns about lower growth expectations. “Given these disappointing results, we believe the bull case ... should be just about dead,” JP Morgan equity analyst C. Stephen Tusa said in a note to investors. 3M’s relatively wide earnings miss and cautionary outlook are out of step with influential peers in the U.S. industrial sector. But the results represent the view of a company more exposed to buyers of smaller-ticket items than other massive conglomerates. The company makes products such as Post-It Notes, tape and sandpaper, in addition to health care and security products. It is also a supplier to other industries that deal directly with individual consumers, such as auto and television makers. Because of this exposure, 3M feels disruptions in the supply chain or sagging consumer demand “typically one to two quarters before our industrial peers,” Buckley said. Some analysts agree that 3M’s unique exposure could be making its situation look worse than it actually is. The company’s core industrial and transport business showed considerable growth in the quarter, Barclays Capital analyst Scott Davis said in a note to investors. “This is the business that matches up more closely with industrial peers,” St. Paul, Minnesota-based 3M reported third-quarter net income attributable to common shareholders of $1.09 billion, or $1.52 per share, down from $1.1 billion, or $1.53 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected $1.61 per share. The company’s quarterly sales also fell short of expectations, rising 10 percent to $7.5 billion, compared with expectations of $7.8 billion. 3M forecast full-year 2011 earnings of $5.85 to $5.95 per share. It previously forecast $6.10 to $6.25. Excluding increased pension expenses, 3M’s earnings are expected to now hit $6.07 to $6.17 The company sees organic sales volume growth — which excludes acquisitions and other unique items — of 3 percent to 4 percent in 2011, down nearly half from its previous view. “3M’s story is all about accelerating organic growth, but organic growth of 2.8 percent continued to decelerate and was the lowest in our sector,” Nomura Equity Research analyst Shannon O’Callaghan said in a note to investors. O’Callaghan said operating margins for 3M’s collection of business segments were below expectations, and he expressed concern over higher pension headwinds and the implication of zero volume growth in the fourth quarter. 3M said slower growth will persist through year-end, pushing the company to respond with “aggressive cost management.” Chief Financial Officer David Meline said despite short-term turbulence, the company is not predicting a double-dip recession, and it is not planning to pull back on capital expenditures, or research and development investments. 3M plans to spend as much as $1.5 billion on capital expenditures this year, up sharply from 2010. Sales in the company’s closely watched display and graphics business fell 12.2 percent in the quarter, due largely to weakness in the LCD television market. The company had already signaled a slowdown in LCD TVs when it reported second-quarter earnings in July. During the quarter, 3M saw double-digit sales growth in its industrial and transportation, health care, and safety and security divisions, and more modest growth in consumer and office business. The industrial and transportation business, 3M’s biggest in terms of revenue, saw hefty growth in Europe and Asia Pacific. Sales of items such as adhesives, abrasives and renewable energy, in addition to acquisitions, led to an 18.8 percent sales increase to $2.6 billion, or about a third of overall revenue. The healthcare business benefited from an uptick in demand for infection prevention and health information systems. Sales in each region of the world showed considerable strength, with Asia Pacific volume rising 20 percent. Personal safety products, roofing granules and corrosion protection products helped drive gains in the safety, security and protection services division.

35,MMM,3M earnings miss expectations; 2011 guidance cut,"(Reuters) - 3M Co’s (MMM.N) quarterly earnings fell well short of expectations due to weakness in the electronics market and inventory-reduction moves by its customers, sending the company’s shares down 6 percent in premarket trading. 3M also lowered its full-year earnings forecast, citing expectations for slower economic growth and lower demand. “The business environment remains challenging, as the economic softening that we experienced late in the second quarter continued into the third,” Chief Executive George Buckley told a press release. 3M’s relatively wide earnings miss and cautionary outlook are out of step with some of its conglomerate peers in the U.S. industrial sector. On Monday, Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) solidly beat expectations with a 44 percent earnings increase, sending its shares and the overall market significantly higher. The report from 3M represents the view of a company more exposed to buyers of smaller-ticket items. The company makes products such as television electronics, Post-It Notes and sandpaper, in addition to healthcare and security products. St. Paul, Minnesota-based 3M reported third-quarter net income attributable to common shareholders of $1.09 billion, or $1.52 per share, down from $1.1 billion, or $1.53 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected $1.61 per share. 3M shares fell 6 percent to $77.25 in premarket trading. The company’s quarterly sales also fell short of expectations, rising 10 percent to $7.5 billion, compared with expectations of $7.8 billion. 3M said many of its customers are lowering inventories in anticipation of slowing demand. While the company continues to experience good growth rates, Buckley said the LCD TV part of its portfolio “remained weak,” and other parts of the electronics business are also slowing. In addition, “policy uncertainty and austerity are affecting growth in Western Europe,” he said. 3M forecast full-year 2011 earnings of $5.85 to $5.95 per share. It previously forecast $6.10 to $6.25. The company sees organic sales volume growth of 3 percent to 4 percent, down from a previous forecast of 6 percent to 7.5 percent. 3M said slower growth will persist through year-end, pushing the company to respond with “aggressive cost management.” It remains bullish on emerging markets and said it would maintain its planned levels of research and development spending.

37,MMM,"PREVIEW-Caution, not succession, weighs on 3M investors","* CEO Buckley nearing mandatory retirement age * 3M’s ability to navigate turbulent economy top concern * Investors expect Buckley to stay on past 65 yrs old * Succession plan boosted by 3M’s “deep bench”-investor By John D. Stoll and Lynn Adler Dec 5 (Reuters) - With 80 days to go until 3M Co  Chief Executive George Buckley hits the company’s mandatory retirement age, investors seem unusually disinterested in the immediate future of the management team. That’s because Buckley is widely expected to seek to extend his contract. And a “deep bench” of 3M executives is ready to take over even if he doesn’t stay on, an investor said. What does interest investors greatly is what Buckley — who turns 65 on Feb. 23 — will tell analysts on Tuesday in New York about 3M’s strategy to tackle the tough business environment and boost revenue in 2012. While the executive, who joined 3M six years ago, is expected to field questions about whether he can work a deal with the board allowing him to stay, the answer will not likely shape the investment case for the company. “Maybe I should be concerned, but I’m not concerned about that,” Jeanie Wyatt, chief executive of South Texas Money Management in San Antonio, said. The firm owns shares of 3M and is confident in the company’s succession plan, which could involve promoting 58-year-old Chief Operating Officer Inge Thulin to the top spot at some point down the road. Wyatt’s sentiment is echoed by other investors who say they would like Buckley to stay a while longer but are more focused on 3M’s ability to overcome today’s difficult business environment and boost revenue. The company’s third quarter results missed expectations due to weakness in Europe and a soft electronics market, and its stock is trading at the lower end of its 52-week range. 3M makes products ranging from Scotch Tape to sandpaper. While sectors such as transportation, security products and health care are particularly strong for the company, electronics and touchscreen displays have suffered under weak customer demand. “We’d like just to get a little more visibility on how they will navigate global growth uncertainty,” said Kevin Walkush, business analyst for Jensen Investment Management, which also owns 3M shares. Asked whether he was thinking much about the likelihood that Buckley will address his future during the outlook meeting, he said no. Walkush said his firm expects 3M to increase revenue by 7 to 8 percent over the long term, including a small percentage of revenue from new acquisitions. He said Jensen is most interested in the 2012 outlook meeting to see “if they are on track for that.” 3M in October reduced its full-year organic sales volume growth forecast to a range of 3 to 4 percent, from its previous expectation of 6 to 7.5 percent. Oliver Pursche, president of Gary Goldberg Financial Services, said the firm owns 3M stock but is not adding to its position until the Minneapolis-based company can convince Wall Street that it is able to boost revenue in the face of headwinds. “For any company, the ability to drive revenue is the lifeblood,” he said. A lack of intense scrutiny related to the future of 3M’s management is driven partially by the expectation that Buckley will win a stay on well past his 65th birthday. “Given the pressures on 3M and the type of individual he is, we would expect him to stay on for another year or two,” Pursche said. “Our preference would be have him on as long as possible. He’s probably one of the strongest CEOs we’ve seen not only at 3M but overall.” During an investor meeting earlier in the year, Buckley said, “I love being the CEO of 3M. ... If the opportunity were there, I would stay, but if it’s not, then obviously the choice is taken out of my hands.” 3M spokeswoman Jackie Berry said the company has nothing to say about Buckley’s future at this time: “I can’t comment on speculation.” The other factor driving investor sentiment is that 3M has a strong replacements in the management ranks. “The biggest thing 3M has going for it is they have a very deep bench,” Pursche said. In May, following the retirement of its then-Chief Financial Officer, Buckley promoted Thulin to the newly created post of chief financial officer. Buckley has said the company prefers to promote from within, including for his job, and that positions Thulin as the likely successor among a field of qualified candidates. Thulin, a native of Sweden, joined 3M in 1979 in sales and marketing. Morningstar stock analyst Adam Fleck said he is well regarded by investors due to his global experience, including eight years of running international operations.",12052011,http://www.reuters.com/article/3m/preview-caution-not-succession-weighs-on-3m-investors-idUSN1E7B412P20111205
38,MMM,3M sees modest 2012 growth; shares higher,"(Reuters) - 3M Co (MMM.N) forecast 2012 earnings and revenue toward the high end of Wall Street expectations, citing “slow but positive growth” in the United States and an expected recovery in the global electronics market in the second half of next year. The diversified U.S. manufacturer forecast 2012 revenue growth of 2 percent to 6 percent due to continued gains in most of its businesses — including the two largest, transportation and health care — and strengthening conditions in emerging markets, including Latin America and China. Acquisitions will also boost revenue in 2012, helping offset negative impacts from taxes and foreign exchange, 3M executives told analysts and investors at a meeting in New York on Tuesday. The Minneapolis-based company reaffirmed its 2011 guidance, calming investor concerns after its third-quarter earnings fell below expectations amid trouble in the electronics business and Western Europe. Shares of 3M were up 1.8 percent at $82.36 in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange, outpacing modest gains in the wider market. Chief Executive George Buckley said 3M sees a “mild recession” in Europe and expects a decrease in display and graphics revenue to persist in 2012. He said the company can manage turbulence in Europe and that the electronics business will see “recovery” in the second half of the year. He said 2012 “will be a pretty good year for 3M despite the challenges that we feel very able to deal with.” A big question about 2012 was left unanswered in the executives’ prepared remarks: Buckley turns 65 in February, the mandatory retirement age at 3M. Presentations given by several executives did not address the succession plan. 3M forecast 2012 earnings of $6.25 to $6.50 per share, up 7 percent to 11 percent from expected 2011 results. It forecast 2012 revenue of $30.2 billion to $31.5 billion. The midpoints of 3M’s forecasts exceed what analysts had forecast for 2012. Analysts’ average forecast is for earnings of $6.28 a share on revenue of $30.59 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Jefferies & Co equities analyst Laurence Alexander called 3M’s outlook “conservative,” noting that the company will be hurt by a higher tax rate and foreign exchange. He said those factors should offset volume growth. But he added that next year’s performance hinges on 3M’s ability to raise prices and boost productivity. The company, making products ranging from Post-It notes to films used in flat-panel televisions, said global demand for more sophisticated and efficient products will drive 2012 revenue, but executives continued to strike a cautious tone. Although Buckley said “Western Europe seems to be getting worse” at the moment, he spent considerable time explaining why the current environment is different from the downturn that took place in 2008 and 2009. He said the “visibility” of the sovereign debt issues in Europe means “the economy is more likely to grow slowly, not collapse.” ",12062011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-3m/3m-sees-modest-2012-growth-shares-higher-idUSTRE7B50T620111206

40,MMM,3M pursues paint-less cars with new partnership,"(Reuters) - 3M Co (MMM.N) has signed a five-year commercial pact with a relatively new stainless steel and aluminum distributor to create a stable of so-called disruptive products, including technology that could eliminate the need for paint on automobiles.  The partnership, being announced on Monday with Chicago-based Shale-Inland, is the latest in a consistent string of acquisitions and joint-ventures that 3M has assembled in pursuit of reaching $50 billion in revenue. The Minneapolis diversified conglomerate wants to grow twice as fast as its fastest-growing competitors.   3M announced a plan in September, for instance, to jointly develop adhesives with International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) to create so-called 3D packaging for semiconductors that could enable faster smartphones, tablets, computers and gaming devices. In October, 3M completed the acquisition of GPI Group, which makes do-it-yourself home improvement products.  This new partnership with Shale-Inland will be specifically tied to 3M’s adhesives and tapes division, which is a core part of 3M’s massive Industrial & Transportation business, 3M said. 3M estimates it will bring in more than $3 billion in adhesives and tapes revenue in 2011.  SCRATCH-LESS MIRRORS, PAINT-LESS CARS   The global metals market, meanwhile, is estimated to currently be in excess of $2 trillion, according to Shale-Inland. 3M hopes to combine its expertise in adhesives and decorative films with Shale-Inland’s relationships and expertise in the metals market.  Shale-Inland meanwhile, is looking to use 3M’s research prowess to beef up innovation in the steel industry.  “The thing that we’re missing in the steel industry is research and development.” Craig Bouchard, chief executive Shale-Inland said. “One of my strongest desires has been to bring technology back.”  Over the coming five years, the partners will work on a suite of technologies, including a new film that will debut in 2012 as a protective barrier for highly reflective stainless steel mirrors. The product will allow buyers of the mirrors — including restaurants or jails — to peel back the film and replace it in the event someone writes on the mirror or damages it in some other way, the companies said.  Bouchard said other innovations further in the pipeline include developing higher-strength tape that could take the place of traditional welding.  One of the innovations on the wish list for 3M and Shale-Inland is the creation of steel or aluminum products — such as washing machines, refrigerators or even automobiles — that no longer require painting. To do this, the partners plan to work together to perfect the process of coating steel with a rainbow of various colored adhesives that would take the place of paint and have the capability of essentially self-repairing scratches and other blemishes.  “If you scratch this tape, three days later the scratch is gone,” Bouchard said.  During a presentation to analysts and investors in New York last week, 3M Chief Operating Officer Inge Thulin said that 3M’s “addressable market” in the auto industry will grow from a $19 billion opportunity in 2011 to $24 billion by 2016.

42,MMM,3M to buy Avery office products business,"(Reuters) - 3M Co (MMM.N) will expand its office supplies business with the $550 million cash purchase of Avery Dennison Corp’s (AVY.N) office and consumer products unit, which includes Avery labels and HI-LITERS markers, the companies said on Tuesday. The deal marks the latest move toward consolidation of the office supply industry, which has been hurt by high U.S. unemployment, private label competition and Asian imports. “The structurally-challenged office product business ... is in need of considerable consolidation to boost profitability,” Baird Equity research analysts said in a research note. They said the deal’s valuation was comparable to November’s deal in which MeadWestvaco Corp MWV.N spun off its consumer and office products business and merged it with Acco Brands Corp ABD.N. 3M, a diversified manufacturer whose products include Post-It notes and Scotch tape, said purchase accounting and acquisition costs would reduce earnings by about 6 cents a share in the first 12 months after the deal closes, expected in the second half of 2012. Excluding one-time items, the deal would boost earnings by 3 cents a share in the same period. 3M’s $4.2 billion consumer and office division represents about 15 percent of its revenue. Through nine months of 2011, the unit posted a $661 million operating profit in the segment, down slightly compared to a year ago despite a 10 percent sales increase. Avery’s office and consumer products business, with estimated 2011 sales of $765 million, would increase 3M’s annual sales by about 2 percent. The Avery division’s sales were higher in 2010, at about $815 million, according to a company presentation. The Brea, California-based division employs about 3,000 people and also makes filing and presentation products. It will expand 3M’s office supplies division that makes packing tape, bubble wrap, glue sticks, projectors and other products, in addition to the iconic Post-It notes and Scotch tape. Avery said it plans to use proceeds from the sale to cut debt, contribute to pensions and buy back shares. Pro-forma sales in 2011, excluding the office products business, are expected to be about $6 billion, it said. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC advised Avery on the transaction. When Avery reported third-quarter results in October, it posted lower sales and margins in the office and consumer products business, citing weak market demand and higher raw materials costs. It said overall weak demand in its businesses would likely continue in the fourth quarter. Shares of Avery were up 3.5 percent at $29.69 in morning trading, while 3M stock — part of the Dow Jones industrial average — was up 2.5 percent to $83.80. Newell Rubbermaid (NWL.N), the maker of Sharpie and Paper Mate pens, rose 2.6 percent to $16.57, all on the New York Stock Exchange.

44,MMM,3M profit tops Wall Street estimates,"(Reuters) - 3M Co (MMM.N) reported higher-than-expected quarterly earnings on Thursday as demand from industrial and transport markets offset weak sales to makers of consumer electronics. The maker of Post-It notes, Scotch tape and components for consumer electronics reported net earnings of $954 million, or $1.35 per share, compared with $928 million, or $1.28 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $1.31 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Revenue fell, however, in the display and graphics segment, hurt by what 3M called “deteriorating” demand for consumer electronics. Its electro and communications also posted lower sales.

46,MMM,"UPDATE 3-Thulin gets 3M helm, Street eyes business as usual","* Buckley nearing mandatory retirement age * COO Inge Thulin to take CEO job Feb. 24 * Thulin to be elected chairman May 8 at annual meeting * 3M shares essentially unchanged By John D. Stoll Feb 8 (Reuters) - 3M Co said Chief Operating Officer Inge Thulin will succeed George Buckley as chief executive on Feb. 24 in a move that signals the board’s desire to stick to its strategic course even as there is a change in leadership. Buckley, who hits 3M’s mandatory retirement age of 65 this month, has been talking with the board of directors in recent months about potentially staying. Thulin, a longtime 3M executive promoted to chief operating officer last year, was widely expected to replace Buckley if he retired. During an interview Wednesday, Thulin declined to discuss specifics of boardroom discussions regarding Buckley’s retirement. He did say that he and the outgoing CEO have been working on a “very precise transition plan” for 10 months to ensure a “very orderly transition.” “The company is doing very well,” Thulin said. “We would like to make that continue,” noting that pursuing acquisitions, funding product creation, and venturing deeper into emerging markets will remain key priorities. 3M’s board expects to elect Thulin to chairman at the company’s annual meeting in May. Buckley, who was not available for comment, will officially retire June 1. In a regulatory filing late Wednesday, 3M said it will pay Thulin a $1.3 million in annual cash salary and an additional $2 million in cash compensation targets. His target long-term incentive grants for 2012 - including stock options - is $8 milion. St. Paul, Minnesota-based 3M, founded in 1902, makes a wide range of products that include Scotch Tape, stethoscopes and sandpaper. It has deep roots in the auto industry, consumer electronics, office supplies and health care. Thulin, 58, was named chief operating officer in May as part of a succession plan that has been well telegraphed to Wall Street. Investors appeared unsurprised by the announcement as 3M shares were virtually unchanged in Wednesday trading. “We expect business as usual,” said Kevin Walkush, business analyst for Jensen Investment Management. “Our expectation is that Inge has been really engaged with Buckley on setting the strategy .... We’re not really sure what would be radically different with Inge.” Jensen owns nearly 3 million shares of 3M. Recently, 3M has posted substantial growth in the transportation sector, security products and health care. But a weak economy in Europe and a soft consumer electronics industry has pressured results. The biggest bright spot has been consistent growth in new regions around the world. Thulin, a native of Sweden, joined 3M in 1979 in sales and marketing, but built a reputation over the past nine years as a well-traveled leader of 3M’s international operations. Sales outside the United States have grown from less than $10 billion in 2003 to $20 billion, or 65 percent of current total sales. Thulin has managed operations in Asia Pacific, Europe and the Middle East. Thulin said 3M would be particularly bullish on Southeast Asia in coming years as it looks to support growth in the region that will be primarily fueled by continued economic development in China. He also cited Brazil as a key market for 3M in coming years. “We need to follow the trends in those parts of the world and invest more aggressively as some of them are starting to pick up,” he said. Thulin told Reuters that Buckley has squarely focused the company on innovation, pointing to the company’s oft-cited “vitality index” that tracks the percentage of revenue generated by products introduced within the last five years. When Buckley arrived in late 2005, the vitality index was less than 20 percent; today it is in excess of 30 percent. Thulin said he plans to continue to boost 3M’s “innovation machine” in coming years. Oliver Pursche, president of Gary Goldberg Financial Services, said “you’re likely to have a continuation of the strategic direction” under new leadership. “(Thulin) needs to keep executing the strategy and fine tuning it.” That includes keeping an eye on potential acquisitions. In recent months, as Thulin has taken a more active role in running the company, 3M has continued to pursue acquisitions. In January, it moved to expand its office supply business with the $550 million cash purchase of Avery Dennison Corp’s  office and consumer products unit, which includes Avery labels and HI-LITERS markers. Shares of 3M closed 0.1 percent higher at $87.97 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has been trading around the highest point since August, following the company’s stronger-than-expected quarterly results in late January. Pursche, whose firm held 3M stock but recently sold it for diversification purposes, said 3M stock’s has performed “OK ... it’s not Apple but it’s not a disaster - it’s not Citigroup.” 3M’s stock has risen about 12 percent over Buckley’s tenure, outpacing the 8 percent rise of the broad Standard & Poor’s 500 index but lagging the company’s blue chip peers. United Technologies Corp shares are up 52 percent over that time and Caterpillar Inc has almost doubled. They trade at 14 times forecast 2012 earnings, a premium to the Dow Jones industrial average’s forward price-to-earnings ratio of 12. Buckley made a big imprint by hemming together the company’s sprawling global operations. He leaves the conglomerate with a legacy of pursuing new acquisitions and accelerating ways to freshen its product portfolio. He has also been credited with deepening 3M’s management bench. “We generally applaud Buckley’s six-year tenure at 3M, where we believe he helped to reinvigorate the company’s research-driven success while maintaining terrific financial health and excellent profitability,” Morningstar analyst Adam Fleck said in a note to investors.

47,MMM,3M CEO Buckley to retire; Thulin to succeed him,"(Reuters) - 3M Co (MMM.N) said Wednesday that Inge Thulin, currently the company’s chief operating officer, will take over for George Buckley as chief executive on February 24, a day after Buckley hits the company’s mandatory retirement age of 65. Thulin, 58, has been the expected replacement for Buckley. Buckley became 3M’s chief executive in 2005 Buckley, who is also chairman, will officially retire from the St. Paul, Minnesota-based conglomerate on June 1. The company plans to elect Thulin chairman of 3M at the annual meeting on May 8. Shares of 3M traded down slightly in Wednesday’s session at $87.85, 4 cents lower than Tuesday’s close. Analysts have pointed to Thulin as one of the key players on a deep bench of 3M executives who have helped drive the company into new sectors and increase revenue during Buckley’s time leading the company. In May, following the retirement of its then-chief financial officer, Buckley promoted Thulin to the newly created post of chief operating officer. Thulin, a native of Sweden, joined 3M in 1979 in sales and marketing. Thulin has spent time managing operations in Asia Pacific, Europe and the Middle East, and his deep international experience has been heralded as a key asset by his supporters. 3M makes products ranging from Scotch Tape to stethoscopes to sandpaper. While sectors such as transportation, security products and healthcare are particularly strong for the company of late, electronics and touchscreen displays have suffered under weak customer demand.

48,MMM,UPDATE 1-3M plans up to $1 bln payment to pension funds,"* Global pension plan 82 pct funded  * 3M’s long-term liabilities increased by $2.4 billion  * Company expects higher pension expense in 2012   Feb 16 (Reuters) - 3M Co plans to contribute about $800 million to $1 billion of cash to global pension and post-retirement plans in 2012 after a reduced discount rate severely inflated the size of long-term liabilities on the company’s balance sheet.  The company, in its annual report filed Thursday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said falling discount rates led to a reduction in the funded status of its pension plans.  As of the end of 2011, the company’s worldwide pension plans were 82 percent funded. U.S. qualified pension plans were approximately 86 percent funded, international plans were 87 percent funded, and the U.S. nonqualified pension plan is not funded.  U.S. qualified plans make up 71 percent of the entire worldwide pension obligation.   The St. Paul, Minnesota-based company said long-term liabilities increased by approximately $2.4 billion as of the end of last year, in large part because lower discount rates inflated the size of 3M’s $18.7 billion pension obligation by about 15 percent.  The size of a pension obligation is typically based on two key assumptions: discount rates and the expected return on plan assets. Discount rates reflect the ability of the debtor to pay off the liability based on the performance of assets in the plan.  3M expects a lower long-term rate of return on those assets than it had previously.  3M plans to pay $300 million in cash to pension funds in each of the first two quarters of the year. The company had $4.6 billion of liquidity and $5.2 billion of debt as of Dec. 31.  3M has said currency-related headwinds and a higher tax rate will also hurt 2012 earnings. But the company’s expectation for sales growth, productivity improvements, and higher prices for its products will help offset those negative factors.  In its filing, 3M said that worldwide employment increased by 4,141 people in 2011, largely driven by acquisitions and hiring needs in developing economies.  Very few of those jobs were added in the United States, where the company is actually looking to slim down. In December, 3M Co started offering early retirement incentives to 4,900 employees, expecting about 15 percent to participate in the program.  The company also said that it spent more money on capital investments outside of the United States than it did on home soil. Of the $1.38 billion spent in 2011, 49.9 percent stayed in the United States, compared with about 52 percent in the two years prior.

50,MMM,UPDATE 2-3M to inject up to $1 bln into pension funds,"* Says higher pension costs to cut 2012 pre-tax earnings by $89 mln * Global pension plan 82 pct funded * 3M’s long-term liabilities increased by $2.4 billion By John D. Stoll Feb 16 (Reuters) - Diversified U.S. conglomerate 3M Co  is topping up staff pension plans with $800 million to $1 billion cash in 2012 as falling discount rates inflate its long-term liabilities, becoming the latest American company to inject cash into underfunded retirement plans. The maker of Post-It notes, Scotch tape and components for consumer electronics, in its annual report filed on Thursday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said the higher pension expenses will reduce 2012 pre-tax earnings by $89 million, including $26 million in charges related to early retirement packages for 616 people. 3M is not alone in its pension shortfall. Boeing Co, General Electric Co, DuPont, Alcoa Inc, Honeywell International Inc and Raytheon Co all plan hefty cash injections into underfunded pension plans. Pension top-ups are expected by analysts to take a big bite out of U.S. corporate earnings this year due to more rigorous funding requirements and an erosion of investment returns caused by weak stock markets and low interest rates. An estimated 97 percent of the pension plans operated by companies in the S&P; 500 have underfunded pensions despite generous contributions last year, according to a Credit Suisse analysis. St. Paul, Minnesota-based 3M said its long-term liabilities increased by approximately $2.4 billion as of the end of last year, in large part because lower discount rates inflated the size of its $18.7 billion pension obligation by about 15 percent. The size of a pension obligation is typically based on two key assumptions — discount rates and the expected return on plan assets. Discount rates reflect the ability of the debtor to pay off the liability based on the performance of assets in the plan. 3M now expects a lower long-term rate of return on those assets than it had previously. As of the end of 2011, 3M said its worldwide pension plans were 82 percent funded. U.S. qualified pension plans were approximately 86 percent funded, international plans were 87 percent funded, and the U.S. non-qualified pension plan is not funded. U.S. qualified plans make up 71 percent of 3M’s entire worldwide pension obligation. 3M plans to pay $300 million in cash to pension funds in each of the first two quarters of the year.

In its filing, 3M said that worldwide employees increased by 4,141 in 2011 to 84,198, largely driven by acquisitions and hiring needs in developing economies. The same factors were behind a 5,222-employee increase in 2010. Relatively few of those jobs were added in the United States, where the company is actually looking to slim down. In December, 3M started offering early retirement incentives to 4,900 employees, expecting about 15 percent, or about 735 employees, to participate in the program. 3M said 616 people accepted early retirement. The company offered to beef up pension benefits in return for participation in the plan. The company also said that it spent more money on capital investments outside of the United States than it did on home soil. Of the $1.38 billion spent in 2011, 49.9 percent stayed in the United States, compared with about 52 percent in the two years prior. The company has nearly doubled its spending in Asia Pacific operations and in the Latin America-Canada unit. “3M is striving to increase its manufacturing and sourcing capacity outside the United States in order to more closely align its production capability with its sales in major geographic regions,” the annual report said. “The initiative is expected to help improve customer service, lower transportation costs, and reduce working capital requirements.”",2172012,http://www.reuters.com/article/3m/update-2-3m-to-inject-up-to-1-bln-into-pension-funds-idUSL2E8DGE1V20120217
51,MMM,"New 3M CEO eyes natural resources, aero for growth","* CEO to create new natural resources division * 3M looking to better organize certain product lines * 3M launched new company vision during earnings call By John D. Stoll April 24 (Reuters) - 3M Co is eager to make a deeper foray into natural resources and aerospace markets to expand beyond consumer products like Scotch Tape, sand paper and touch-screen displays, new chief executive Inge Thulin said Tuesday. The U.S. manufacturer is planning an immediate push into markets that service customers dealing with the gas, oil, mining and water industries by forming a new division called “natural resource management and extraction.” “We have been in those markets for some time,” Thulin told analysts during a conference call after posting quarterly earnings on Tuesday. “But at least in my mind, and the organization’s mind here in total, we have not given full attention in terms of additional investment in order to accelerate our growth.” Other companies have been looking to boost business in the natural resources sector. Caterpillar Inc, for instance,  has in recent years increased profit by diving into the area via acquisitions in the mining sector. “If you look at the play for natural resources, it’s a huge market globally,” said Kevin Walkush, business analyst for Jensen Investment Management. He cited an “energy renaissance” taking place in the United States, with natural gas and oil exploration increasing, as one example of why 3M would more aggressively chase this business. Jensen owns 3 million shares of 3M. Thulin has been at 3M’s helm for two months and presided over his first quarterly earnings report on Tuesday. Profit came in ahead of Wall Street expectations and 3M raised its full-year outlook, sending shares up 1.6 percent to close at $88.49. Thulin’s heightened focus on natural resources comes as he looks to manage a set of challenges inherited from predecessor George Buckley. While Buckley is credited with reshaping 3M by refining the  focus, boosting growth targets and increasing research and development budgets, the company’s volatile display and graphics division is struggling. And sales fell in Asia Pacific. 3M will also seek further inroads in the aerospace sector. Thulin believes the company’s product range, including composite films, abrasives and personal protection devices, can help it jump-start sales to aerospace companies. “That’s a good opportunity for us to enable lighter, safer, quieter aircraft, constructed faster. We believe with additional technologies that we can accelerate that even more - meaning more focus and investment will go into that business,” he said. 3M has six main operating divisions, such as office supplies or healthcare, and a myriad of subdivisions, such as food safety or optical systems. A spokeswoman for 3M said it will focus on better grouping its natural resources products, such as cement products, pipeline protectants and liquid filtration, to more effectively sell to customers in the natural resources sector. The move should allow the company to provide more managerial focus on underdeveloped businesses without shifting investment out of another sector. 3M had done this with its automotive business by bundling products such as window coatings and paint supplies under the same umbrella, Morningstar equities analyst Adam Fleck said. The company now points to automotive as a key growth business. “If you kind of think about the industrial space as a whole they have a lot of opportunity,” Fleck said. This move “helps them to focus from a managerial perspective,” he said.",4242012,http://www.reuters.com/article/3m-thulin/new-3m-ceo-eyes-natural-resources-aero-for-growth-idUSL2E8FOG7520120424

Shares of Apple Inc fell 2 percent to $560.28 in volatile trading ahead of the company’s results, due after the close. The stock of the world’s most valuable company has fallen in recent weeks after its huge run higher. Apple’s stock was last up 38 percent for the year - in contrast with a gain of nearly 60 percent for the year so far earlier this month. 3M reported an increase in quarterly profit and slightly lifted its full-year outlook, helping the Dow, along with AT&T; Inc. The earnings season so far has been stronger than analysts expected. With results in from 153 S&P; 500 companies, more than three-fourths have topped analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters Proprietary Research. “U.S. corporate earnings are actually coming in pretty strong,” said Natalie Trunow, chief investment officer of equities at Calvert Investment Management in Bethesda, Maryland, whose firm manages about $13 billion in assets. “Negatives are being paid attention to more at the moment than the positives, but the positive earnings reports are providing some support here.” The Dow Jones industrial average gained 74.39 points, or 0.58 percent, to 13,001.56 at the close. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 5.03 points, or 0.37 percent, to 1,371.97. The Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 8.85 points, or 0.30 percent, to 2,961.60. Adding to weakness in tech, Netflix Inc shares sank 13.9 percent to $87.68, a day after it forecast slower subscriber growth this quarter. Texas Instruments Inc forecast second-quarter revenue growth above estimates, signaling the end of a prolonged inventory-related decline in demand, but the results weren’t enough to counter the broader weakness in tech. Its stock slid 1.7 percent to $31.36. Many analysts have cautioned that a correction is near, given the stock market’s sharp rally since October. The S&P; 500 is up 9.1 percent so far for the year. “When you see the big spread between the Dow and the Nasdaq, you know that there’s a bit of a flight to safety there, so people are leaving the over-the-counter stocks and buying the higher quality securities. So New York didn’t look as strong as it might have appeared,” said Douglas Davis, chief executive officer of Davis-Rea in Toronto. But the S&P; 500 should hold near-term support at 1,340 in the current retreat before rallying again, according to Brown Brothers Harriman analysts. The index held at 1,340 during a pullback in early March, which coincides with a 23.6 percent retracement of the rally from October. AT&T; advanced 3.6 percent to $31.72, while 3M gained 1.6 percent to $88.49. Shares of United Technologies, which also reported results that beat forecasts, edged up 0.1 percent to close at $79.85. Economic data took a backseat to earnings news. U.S. single-family home prices rose for the first time in 10 months in an encouraging sign the battered sector was starting to stabilize, according to the latest S&P;/Case-Shiller report. Separately, the government said single-family home sales sagged to their lowest level in four months, but sales in the previous three months were revised higher than initially thought.

The maker of Post-It notes, Scotch tape and components for consumer electronics reported net earnings of $1.12 billion, or $1.59 per share, compared with $1.08 billion, or $1.49 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $1.49 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The 2012 results included a 4 cent per share charge related to a voluntary retirement program. The earnings report represents the first financial update since Inge Thulin, formerly 3M’s chief operating officer, took over for George Buckley as the company’s chief executive earlier this year. “We are off to a very good start in 2012 with record first-quarter sales and strong earnings,” Thulin said in a press release.  “I am confident in our ability to improve every aspect of our company.” Thulin took over following a record 2011 for 3M in terms of sales and earnings per share. The company has been growing through a string of acquisitions and strength in key business segments. 3M has seen weakness in Europe and Asia, however, and its graphics business has been a drag on its sales performance. 3M’s sales rose 2.4 percent to $7.5 billion during the first quarter, the company said. The revenue performance was in line with analyst expectations. The company increased its forecast for 2012 earnings to a range of $6.35 and $6.50 per share, up from its prior range of $6.25 and $6.50 per share. 3M maintained its expectation for growth in organic sales of between 2 percent and 5 percent, and operating margins in a range of 21 percent to 22.5 percent. The company reported increases in three of the five business segments it operates, including an transportation, safety and security services, office supplies and health care. However, the company reported a 12 percent decline in its display and graphics business, and a 3.4 percent decline in its electro/communications business. Sales increased in Latin America, Canada and the United States, and were flat in Europe. 3M reported a 2 percent sales decline in Asia.

55,MMM,Protesters to target 3M political contributions,"(Reuters) - Opponents of corporate political donations plan to picket 3M Co’s (MMM.N) shareholder meeting on Tuesday in a bid to get the diversified U.S. manufacturer to stop making political contributions. About 100 protesters are expected to turn out at the meeting in St. Paul, Minnesota, to support a shareholder proposal that would prohibit the maker of Post-It notes and films used in television screens from directly contributing to election campaigns, according to organizers. “Their political spending policies continue to risk their brand and ultimately shareholder value,” said Shelley Alpern, a vice president at Boston-based Trillium Asset Management, which submitted the proposal, which also asks 3M to ensure that any trade associations it is a member of not donate its dues to campaigns. Another measure calls on 3M to disclose how it spends its lobbying budget. Directors of the St. Paul-based company urged shareholders to vote against both proposals, saying the ban on contributions would “imprudently” limit its ability to advance its interests. “It is in the stockholders’ and company’s best interests for the company to be an effective participant in the legislative and regulatory process,” 3M said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A few hundred shareholders typically attend 3M’s meetings. This year will mark Inge Thulin’s first as chief executive. The Trillium proposal traces back to a 2010 Minnesota gubernatorial campaign when Target Corp (TGT.N) became the target of a boycott after contributing to a group that funded Republican candidate Tom Emmer, an opponent of gay marriage. 3M contributed to the same organization. Target and 3M both said they backed Emmer for his positions on business, not social, issues. Target later changed its contribution policy to assess a candidate’s full agenda. A similar episode unfolded this year when activists threatened to boycott corporate sponsors of the American Legislative Exchange Council, the organization behind the “Stand Your Ground” gun laws that contributed to the controversy around the fatal shooting in February of teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida. Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N and PepsiCo Inc PEP.N cut ties with the group, which then dropped its work on social issues, confining itself to business and economics. It has been a lively year for shareholder meetings. Shareholders have pushed back against management, most prominently at Citigroup Inc (C.N), where an advisory vote rejected CEO Vikram Pandit’s pay package. More than 40 percent of AT&T; Inc (T.N) and Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) shareholders voted to split the chairman and CEO roles — a higher-than-average number but not enough to pass the measure. Even more noise has come from members of the “99 Percent” movement, who are protesting the influence of money in politics, low corporate taxes and rising home foreclosures. Last month, thousands of protesters converged outside Wells Fargo & Co’s (WFC.N) annual meeting and about 100 protesters interrupted the start of General Electric Co’s (GE.N) parley. A similarly large turnout is expected at the Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) meeting in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Wednesday. Protesters at 3M’s meeting plan to take a subdued tone, picketing outside and asking questions inside.

Meeting in St. Paul, Minnesota, shareholders approved all board-recommended motions, including an advisory vote on executive pay. Boston-based Trillium Asset Management had made the proposal that the company cease making political donations, following a 2010 incident when Target Corp became the target of a boycott campaign after contributing to a Republican candidate who opposed gay marriage. Target, as well as fellow contributor 3M, said they backed the candidate for his positions on business, not social issues. Opponents of corporate political donations argued that 3M put its reputation at risk by making contributions to potentially controversial candidates. The board had advised shareholders to allow it to continue making contributions, saying it needed to be “an effective participant in the legislative process.”",5082012,http://www.reuters.com/article/3m-meeting/3m-holders-reject-move-to-end-political-spending-idUSL1E8G8A3920120508

Bernstein downgraded 3M Co  to “market-perform” from “outperform,” saying it will have to spend more to keep its growth-engine humming and margins may face further pressure if economic conditions deteriorate. “3M is well past prior revenue peaks and while they have demonstrated pricing power, we are concerned about sustainability, hot margins in healthcare and increasing competition broadly,” analysts led by Steven Winoker said. To achieve faster growth the diversified U.S. manufacturer would have to step up research and development spending, marketing and other growth driven expenditures, they said. In addition, it would be tough for the company to continue raising prices as it faces increasing competition across multiple businesses, Bernstein analysts said. They cut their price target on 3M’s stock to $101 from $102. Shares of 3M were down about 1 percent in premarket trading on Thursday.

58,MMM,UPDATE 1-3M CFO says European businesses steady,"NEW YORK, June 5 (Reuters) - 3M Co’s finance chief, who visited Germany and France last week, said his trip showed that 3M’s European businesses are neither getting better nor worse. Western Europe remains weak but the company is sticking to its earlier forecast that calls for 2 to 5 percent core sales growth this year, Chief Financial Officer David Meline told an investor conference. “We didn’t come away with any indication of any significant change in the outlook for the (European) business,” Meline told the JP Morgan Diversified Industries conference. “We came in to 2012 with a fairly cautious view ... That still looks like a good view. We haven’t seen any big changes jump out at us since we did the original plan.” Meline, whose company’s performance is heavily dependent on economic trends, said 3M was prepared for a significant economic downturn but does not currently expect one. Separately, Meline said the diversified manufacturer was on track to do about $1 billion to $2 billion in acquisitions this year and that prices were becoming more “realistic.” Any deals are more likely to be small “bolt-ons” than “transformational” ones, he said. 3M is reviewing its strategy and its portfolio now that Chief Executive Inge Thulin is also the company’s chairman, the CFO said. But since Thulin was instrumental in shaping long-term strategy under prior CEO George Buckley, investors will not face surprises. “You shouldn’t expect a big shift in direction,” Meline said. 3M shares were down 10 cents, or 0.1 percent, at $82.52 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.",6052012,http://www.reuters.com/article/3m-europe/update-1-3m-cfo-says-european-businesses-steady-idUSL1E8H57OV20120605
59,MMM,3M says graphics business not signaling recession,"NEW YORK, June 14 (Reuters) - 3M Co is seeing steady growth in its commercial graphics business that puts images on the sides of trucks and on storefronts, and which acts as an economic indicator, 3M’s finance chief said on Thursday. “That is a business that tends to see early signs of either an upturn or an inflection down,” Chief Financial Officer David Meline told a Deutsche Bank industrial conference in Chicago. “We do continue to see steady growth with those businesses right now. We’re watching them very carefully because we, too, see what’s in the headlines ... but I can’t say right now that we’ve seen any changes that are significant.” June is an important month for 3M, Meline added, so it is too soon to tell how the quarter will finish. The commercial graphics business accounts for about a fifth of sales in 3M’s display and graphics segment, which itself is one of 3M’s smaller divisions. U.S.-listed industrial stocks are down some 9 percent from their March highs, lagging the wider market, amid concerns Europe’s debt crisis is dragging down even those countries that have so far seemed insulated, such as Germany. That, in turn, has raised fears of a potential United States recession. “While the U.S. still seems like the best game in town, it’s impossible to ignore the potential impact a slumping Europe may have on the already slow-going recovery,” industrial analyst Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners said in a note to clients.",6142012,http://www.reuters.com/article/3m-graphics-recession/3m-says-graphics-business-not-signaling-recession-idUSL1E8HE5P620120614
60,MMM,3M pays $110 million for Federal Signal highway technology,"(Reuters) - 3M Co will expand its traffic safety division by paying $110 million for the electronic tolling business of Federal Signal Corp, a safety and transportation systems maker, sending Federal Signal shares up 18 percent in early trading. Federal Signal, which had outstanding debt of $235.6 million as of March 2012, said it would use the proceeds to reduce debt. The technology business, known as FSTech, contributes about 13 percent of Federal Signal’s total revenue. Revenue at the business was $28.5 million for the first quarter of 2012. FSTech, which employs about 500 people, develops hardware and software for applications used in electronic tolling, parking and access control, and electronic vehicle registration. Electronic tolling, already a $3 billion market, is expected to grow by double digits as cash-strapped governments turn to tolls to fund highway infrastructure. 3M, which expects to spend $1 billion to $2 billion on deals this year, said the transaction should close by the end of the year. It has said deals are more likely to be small “bolt-on” acquisitions than transformative ones. “I think the price and growth expectations right now are a little bit more realistic than they were over the last year or two,” 3M CFO David Meline told an investor conference this month. Jefferies & Co Inc advised Federal Signal on the deal. Federal Signal’s shares jumped 18 percent, or 86 cents, to $5.60 on the New York Stock Exchange, where they were the leading percentage gainer. 3M stock gained 0.9 percent to $88.32.

63,MMM,Cost controls lift 3M profit but sales disappoint,"(Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer 3M Co (MMM.N) reported quarterly profit narrowly beat Wall Street estimates on Thursday, helped by pricing and stronger margins in all six divisions, even as revenue disappointed. 3M, the maker of Post-It notes, specialty films used in consumer electronics, and health and safety products, kept its full-year forecast unchanged but trimmed its sales outlook. It said Western European economies remained challenging, so it will focus on keeping down costs to protect margins. “Our plan called for tight control over spending ... that level of cost control will continue for the foreseeable future,” said 3M Chief Executive Inge Thulin, who took over the top job in February. Shares of 3M, a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI, were up nearly 3 percent at $91.32 in early trading. The Dow jumped 1.7 percent. 3M earned $1.17 billion, or $1.66 per share, compared with $1.16 billion or $1.60 per share, a year earlier, beating analyst estimates by 1 cent a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales dipped 2 percent to $7.53 billion, about $250 million shy of Wall Street estimates. Sales and profits were lower in 3M’s display and graphics business and in a segment that serves telecommunications and consumer electronics markets. The strong dollar reduced revenue by 4 percentage points. St. Paul, Minnesota-based 3M kept its 2012 profit forecast at $6.35 to $6.50 a share. Consensus estimates are near the bottom of that range.

73,MMM,"3M, Honeywell step up deals amid economic uncertainty","(Reuters) - 3M Co and Honeywell International Inc signed separate takeover deals to further diversify their broad lineups of industrial goods at a time of uncertainty for the world economy, the large U.S. manufacturers said on Monday. 3M said it would pay $860 million to buy industrial ceramics company Ceradyne Inc, the biggest takeover deal for the maker of products ranging from Post-It notes to films used in television screens since it named Inge Thulin chief executive officer in February. Honeywell announced plans to pay $525 million in cash for a 70 percent stake in privately held Thomas Russell Co, which makes equipment used in natural gas production. Big U.S. manufacturers including General Electric Co have invested heavily to boost their exposure to that sector amid a surge in U.S. natural gas production driven by advances in hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, technology. The announcements come less than two weeks after the CEOs of both Honeywell and 3M separately said that a worrisome world economic outlook was making it easier to negotiate acquisitions by tempering expectations of what companies would fetch. 3M’s shares were up 1.5 percent, despite some analysts’ concerns that it may not have gotten Ceradyne for a bargain, paying a 43 percent premium on its Friday closing price, said Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau. “The valuation is pretty full on this one,” Windau said. “But it does fit nicely with 3M and what their fundamental business is, and that is the materials sector. It makes a lot of sense for them.” S&P; Capital IQ analyst Richard Tortoriello said 3M had paid a fair price for Ceradyne, whose shares were down about 9 percent this year as of Friday. Ceradyne stock was up 42.9 percent at $34.92 in early afternoon trading, just below the $35 offer price from 3M, whose shares gained 1.5 percent to $93.79. Honeywell rose 2 percent to $60.94. The deals come despite a host of worries sapping corporate confidence. Among them are concerns the U.S. fiscal cliff that could force sharp year-end spending cuts by the federal government, Europe’s debt crisis and slowing growth in Asia. In response, U.S. industrials have stepped up their pace of dealmaking. So far in 2012, they had announced $50.93 billion in mergers as of Sunday, up 7.2 percent from a year earlier. During that time, the overall pace of U.S. dealmaking has declined 23.1 percent to $593.49 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. “When times are bad and everybody is uncertain about the future, that is the right time to buy,” Honeywell CEO Dave Cote said last month, reasoning that acquisitions made in boom times are more likely to be overvalued. Serial buyers, such as 3M and Honeywell, tend to study takeover targets for an extended time before making an offer, moving only when they feel they will be able to negotiate a price that matches their valuation models, said analyst Brian Langenberg of Langenberg & Co. “If the asset makes sense and the price makes sense, you go for it,” Langenberg said. Not every company in the sector is looking to bulk up, though. Tyco International Ltd on Monday completed its three-way breakup, with the remaining parent company focused on commercial fire and security products, with its former consumer alarm business now trading as ADT Corp and its former water operations rolled into Pentair Inc. Thulin told investors on September 19 that he would seek fewer but larger deals than his predecessor, George Buckley, but he held to the company’s long-term goal of making $1 billion to $2 billion in acquisitions per year. The company has yet another large deal in the works - it is working to overcome U.S. regulators’ objections to its planned $550 million takeover of Avery-Dennison Corp’s office products business. 3M said its deal would reduce earnings by 5 cents per share in the first 12 months following closure, which it expects in the fourth quarter. Analysts have forecast 2013 earnings of $6.93 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Focusing on larger deals may be a more effective way of increasing the size of 3M, which analysts expect to generate $30 billion in revenue this year. Ceradyne would add $476.7 million to that total, and boost its presence in the aerospace sector, where 3M is currently a small player. Meanwhile, Honeywell’s UOP arm has the right to buy the remaining 30 percent of Thomas Russell, at a price linked to the business’s operating income. Decade-old Thomas Russell should generate 2012 revenue of about $425 million, Honeywell said. Analysts expect revenue of $38.11 billion this year from Honeywell, which also makes aircraft electronics and building control systems. Honeywell said it expected its deal to have no effect on 2012 profit and to boost 2013 earnings.

82,MMM,3M follows other big companies - reorganizes,"(Reuters) - 3M Co (MMM.N) said Wednesday it had restructured into five major business groups, down from six, and set up new roles for some of its senior executives. The realignment follows reorganization plans announced at other companies including FedEx Corp (FDX.N) and General Electric Co. (GE.N) to cut costs amid slow global economic growth. 3M, which said on Monday it was buying Ceradyne Inc CRDN.O in its biggest deal since naming a new chief executive officer in February, will now be comprised of consumer, industrial, health care, and new safety & graphics and electronics & energy groups. The maker of Post-It notes, specialty films used in consumer electronics and safety products, said it eliminated its display and graphics group and put businesses within that group into the other best-matched groups. “From a long-term perspective, we’ve liked some of the moves that 3M has made, especially in some (of) the potentially faster-growing emerging markets for them,” said Jeff Windau, Edward Jones industrials analyst. 3M in July trimmed its sales outlook and said it planned tight spending controls to protect margins. The new structure is effective immediately, with segments reporting under the new organization effective January 1, 2013. “By building scale more broadly, we create critical mass in each business group to take full advantage of innovation and commercialization opportunities,” Inge Thulin, 3M’s chief executive, said in a statement on Wednesday. Shares of 3M rose 0.4 percent at midday to $93.95 on the New York Stock Exchange, up about 15 percent so far this year. “It wasn’t long ago that GE did the same thing, and it’s basically streamlining across the business to get more efficient for cost savings,” said Dallas-based Hodges Capital Management portfolio manager Gary Bradshaw, who holds 3M shares. The new safety and graphics division will be led by Executive Vice President Julie Bushman, former head of 3M’s safety, security and protection services business. Executive Vice President Mike Kelly, former head of 3M’s display and graphics business, will lead the new electronics and energy group. The industrial group will be headed by Executive Vice President Brad Sauer, former head of 3M’s health care business.

83,MMM,UPDATE 1-3M follows other big companies - reorganizes,"* Reallignment follows cost-saving plans by GE, FedEx, others * New groups highlight growth opportunities - analyst * Shares up 0.4 percent By Lynn Adler Oct 3 (Reuters) - 3M Co said Wednesday it had restructured into five major business groups, down from six, and set up new roles for some of its senior executives. The reallignment follows reorganization plans announced at other companies including FedEx Corp and General Electric Co. to cut costs amid slow global economic growth. 3M, which said on Monday it was buying Ceradyne Inc  in its biggest deal since naming a new chief executive officer in February, will now be comprised of consumer, industrial, health care, and new safety & graphics and electronics & energy groups. The maker of Post-It notes, specialty films used in consumer electronics and safety products, said it eliminated its display and graphics group and put businesses within that group into the other best-matched groups. “From a long-term perspective, we’ve liked some of the moves that 3M has made, especially in some (of) the potentially faster-growing emerging markets for them,” said Jeff Windau, Edward Jones industrials analyst. 3M in July trimmed its sales outlook and said it planned tight spending controls to protect margins. The new structure is effective immediately, with segments reporting under the new organization effective Jan. 1, 2013. “By building scale more broadly, we create critical mass in each business group to take full advantage of innovation and commercialization opportunities,” Inge Thulin, 3M’s chief executive, said in a statement on Wednesday. Shares of 3M rose 0.4 percent at midday to $93.95 on the New York Stock Exchange, up about 15 percent so far this year. “It wasn’t long ago that GE did the same thing, and it’s basically streamling across the business to get more efficient for cost savings,” said Dallas-based Hodges Capital Management portfolio manager Gary Bradshaw, who holds 3M shares. The new safety and graphics division will be led by Executive Vice President Julie Bushman, former head of 3M’s safety, security and protection services business. Executive Vice President Mike Kelly, former head of 3M’s display and graphics business, will lead the new electronics and energy group. The industrial group will be headed by Executive Vice President Brad Sauer, former head of 3M’s health care business. Health care will be run by Executive Vice President Joaquin Delgado, who had led 3M’s electro and communications business. The consumer division will continue to be led by Executive Vice President Mike Vale.

97,MMM,3M sees 2013 earnings up 8 percent in weak economy,"(Reuters) - 3M Co (MMM.N) expects earnings to rise about 8 percent next year, with sales growth coming in below the diversified U.S. manufacturer’s long-term targets amid a weak global economy. 3M, whose products range from Post-It notes to films used in electronics, said on Wednesday it expects to earn $6.70 to $6.95 per share in 2013, a range that at its midpoint is below analysts’ average forecast. The St. Paul, Minnesota-based company is the second major manufacturer to set a 2013 earnings target a bit shy of Wall Street estimates, following on the heels of Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), which laid out its forecast on Monday. 3M expects organic revenue — a measure that excludes the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and exchange-rate fluctuations — to rise by 2 percent to 5 percent next year. The forecast, which is below the company’s long-term revenue growth target of 4 percent to 6 percent, reflects “a weaker global economy in the near term,” Chief Financial Officer David Meline said on a conference call with investors. The midpoint of 3M’s earnings-per-share forecast is 8 percent above the midpoint of its 2012 forecast. Analysts on average were expecting 2013 earnings of $6.85 per share excluding one-time items, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 3M last month laid out a long-term growth plan that calls for earnings per share to rise by roughly 10 percent a year through 2017. Chief Executive Inge Thulin, who took the top job in February, has said one of the company’s first priorities is to prune its broad portfolio of products, with 3M likely to focus on fewer but larger takeovers. Thulin told investors he has identified businesses that generate about 8 percent of 3M’s annual revenue that need to be fixed or sold, though he has not identified those units. The company has already closed one large deal initiated on Thulin’s watch, the $860 million purchase of Ceradyne Inc, a maker of advanced technical ceramics. 3M is one of several large U.S. manufacturers laying out their expectations for 2013. United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) and General Electric Co (GE.N) are due to issue their outlooks in the coming days. 3M shares have gained about 12 percent this year, outpacing the Dow Jones industrial average's .DJI 9 percent rise.

Brazil has no tax treaty with the United States. Last year, it was the largest U.S. trading partner lacking such an agreement. As a result, the country is often at the center of tax disputes between U.S. companies and the IRS. The latest one, brought before the U.S. Tax Court in March, involves 2006 royalty payments for use of intangible property - including 3M trademarks for Post-it notes and Nexcare bandages - from 3M’s Brazilian unit to the parent company in Minnesota. The IRS wants to tax the payments and is saying 3M is not bringing enough of them into the United States, while 3M contends it is barred under Brazilian law from remitting more payments, Tax Court filings showed. 3M and the IRS declined to comment on Wednesday. The dispute suggests the IRS is getting tougher on “transfer pricing,” tax professionals said on Wednesday. This is a hotly contested area of international taxation involving the valuation of assets and capital shifted by multinational corporations among international subsidiaries. Under Brazil’s restrictions, 3M remitted $5.1 million in trademark royalties to the United States in 2006 on about $563 million in Brazilian sales in 2006, the Tax Court filing said. The IRS says 3M should have sent an additional $27.8 million, according to the court documents. The amount of taxes in dispute is $4.8 million. “This is really a dispute over each jurisdiction trying to make sure they get their share,” said Tatiana Falcao, a research fellow at the International Bureau of Fiscal Documentation, or IBFD, a tax research group. Multinational corporations often manage their transfer pricing to cut tax costs, frequently by shifting profits to low-tax from high-tax countries. Governments, including the United States, work to combat these strategies. “Here’s another effort from IRS to come in and make sure it’s not getting the short end of the stick,” said Guy Sanschagrin, a managing director with WTP Advisors, a tax advisory firm. “The IRS is trying to pick an area to push back on.” A Tax Court win for 3M would deal a blow to the IRS and establish a precedent that “the U.S. must defer to Brazilian law,” said Michael Mundaca, a director of tax services with Big Four accounting firm Ernst & Young. “This is not an issue that will go away” and is not exclusive to 3M, he added.

Governments, including the United States, work to combat these strategies. “Here’s another effort from IRS to come in and make sure it’s not getting the short end of the stick,” said Guy Sanschagrin, a managing director with WTP Advisors, a tax advisory firm. “The IRS is trying to pick an area to push back on.” A Tax Court win for 3M would deal a blow to the IRS and establish a precedent that “the U.S. must defer to Brazilian law,” said Michael Mundaca, a director of tax services with Big Four accounting firm Ernst & Young. “This is not an issue that will go away” and is not exclusive to 3M, he added. The case is 3M Company and subsidiaries v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue.

109,MMM,3M cuts 2013 outlook on falling electronics demand,"(Reuters) - Diversified U.S. manufacturer 3M Co cut its 2013 profit forecast on Thursday, citing weakening demand for flat-panel televisions as well as the stronger U.S. dollar. The lowered outlook came after first-quarter profit and revenue both missed Wall Street expectations. 3M, which makes a range of products from Post-It notes to Scotch tape, blamed falling sales in its consumer electronics segment, which makes films used to make flat-panel TV displays. Prices for those TVs, as well as the amount of televisions sold, have fallen recently as consumers move toward touch-screen devices. Global demand for TVs is expected to plateau this year as many consumers in developed countries already own a flat-screen TV. TV manufacturers Sony Corp and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd are among 3M’s largest customers. Both are paring their TV units. 3M executives had expected weak demand for TV parts and other electronic materials, including insulation and fluids used to make computer chips, but they said actual sales were worse than feared. “We expected a challenging start to the year, but in fact market conditions were tougher than we had expected,” Chief Executive Inge Thulin said on a conference call with investors. The machines 3M uses to make the TV films are complex and expensive, and the trick for the company will be to find even more ways to use the machines for touchscreen products, William Blair & Co analyst Nick Heymann said. Already, Apple Inc is a key 3M customer. “You just have too much capacity” in the TV market, Heymann said. “3M is working through it. Now, they’ve got to move to the next market.” While a 56 percent drop in pension payments boosted first-quarter margins, analysts were wary because higher sales failed to contribute more to the margin strength. 3M now expects to earn $6.60 to $6.85 per share this year, a range mostly below the $6.82 average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 3M previously had expected to earn $6.70 to $6.95 per share this year. Also, the rising value of the U.S. dollar compared with other global currencies harmed results, executives said. Previously, the company had not expected foreign currency changes to harm 2013 results, but now it was seen cutting revenue by 1.5 percent. 3M shares were down 2.4 percent at $105.33 late on Thursday morning on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has gained about 16 percent this year, outpacing the Dow Jones industrial average’s rise of roughly 12 percent. St. Paul, Minnesota-based 3M posted first-quarter profit of $1.13 billion, or $1.61 per share, compared with $1.13 billion, or $1.59 per share, in the year-earlier period. Profit per share missed analysts’ estimates of $1.65. The number of outstanding shares fell, boosting the most recent earnings per share. Revenue rose 2 percent to $7.63 billion, missing the $7.81 billion estimate from analysts. Thulin, who took the top job last year, began a restructuring in January. He merged 3M’s security and traffic-safety units, eliminating about 300 jobs, and identified other units that 3M would need to fix, sell or close. Thulin has said 3M needs to prune its broad portfolio of products, and is likely to focus on fewer but larger takeovers.

Strong market breadth showed an increased appetite for equities, but trading volume was light, a sign that many market participants were taking a wait-and-see attitude. The Fed’s two-day policy meeting started Tuesday, and traders are trying to guess its timeline for scaling back  purchases of $85 billion per month of bonds. The policy, known as quantitative easing, has helped fuel stocks’ rally, taking major indexes to record levels. The S&P; is about 1 percent away from its all-time closing high. The Fed has said its goal is to target its benchmark interest rate near zero to lower the unemployment rate to 6.5 percent as long as inflation stays below 2.5 percent. A policy statement from the central bank will be released Wednesday, and investors expect the current level of purchases will be maintained despite strong recent data pointing to improvements in the economy. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke recently said the program would be wound down when the economy is strong enough, causing a surge of volatility in financial markets. “Stocks are higher as investors adjust to the fact that not only will the Fed not announce tapering tomorrow, but that the economy is quite capable of growing without it,” said David Kelly, the chief global strategist for JPMorgan Funds in New York, which has about $400 billion in assets under management. “There are reasons to be cautious and uncertain, but the market is still cheap and should continue to expand for a long time,” he said, adding that he was overweight on cyclical groups, whose fortunes are especially tied to the pace of growth. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 138.38 points, or 0.91 percent, at 15,318.23. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up 12.76 points, or 0.78 percent, at 1,651.80. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 30.05 points, or 0.87 percent, at 3,482.18. General Electric gained 2.4 percent to $24.33 and was one of the most actively traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange. Natural sources company Cliffs Natural Resources  jumped 5 percent to $18.59 as one of the biggest gainers on the S&P.; Micron Tech climbed 3.9 percent to $13.75, helping to boost the Nasdaq. Boeing launched a larger version of its flagship Dreamliner aircraft at the Paris Airshow on Tuesday, sharpening the battle with rival Airbus in the market for fuel-efficient, long-distance jets. Boeing shares rose 1 percent to $104.08, its highest since October 2007. About two-thirds of companies traded on both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq rose, with both exchanges seeing more than 150 securities hit 52-week highs, including 3M Co. About 5.43 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and NYSE MKT, below the daily average so far this year of about 6.36 billion shares. The S&P; 500 is forecast to end 2013 at 1,700, according to the median forecast from 42 analysts surveyed by Reuters in the past week. That 19 percent gain for 2013 would mark the best year since 2009. The market has been volatile since Bernanke said on May 22 the Fed could begin to trim its stimulus in the “next few meetings” if the economy gains momentum and inflation remains moderate. Intraday swings have widened and the CBOE Volatility index, a measure of investor anxiety, is up 31 percent so far this quarter. Consumer prices rose slightly last month, the government said on Tuesday, giving the deflation-wary Fed some respite. The consumer price index, excluding food and energy, advanced 1.7 percent in the 12 months since May, indicating inflation pressures remain subdued. Shares of Walter Energy Inc jumped 16.5 percent to $13.63, rebounding after a two-day selloff triggered by news that the company pulled a planned $1.55 billion credit refinancing. On the downside, Hormel Foods Corp fell 3.6 percent to $39.20 after cutting its full-year profit view. It was the biggest percentage decliner on the S&P.; After the market closed, Adobe Systems Inc rose 4.2 percent to $45.20 after reporting adjusted earnings that beat expectations.",6182013,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-usa-stocks/us-stocks-wall-st-extends-rise-investors-see-no-change-in-fed-policy-idUSL2N0EU1RY20130618

The major U.S. stock indexes hovered near break-even levels for much of the day after some encouraging economic data limited early losses, but turned lower in the last hour of the trading day. Equities have rallied in recent weeks on expectations of continued stimulus from the Federal Reserve. The S&P; 500 has risen for eight straight weeks, its longest run since a nine-week climb between November 2003 and January 2004, putting its yearly gain at nearly 27 percent. Both the Dow and the S&P; 500 have hit repeated all-time highs this year. “We’re not expecting a severe pullback, but we’re not jumping into the market with both feet, given how far we’ve come, and that there are no real catalysts,” said John Norris, managing director of wealth management with Oakworth Capital Bank in Birmingham, Alabama. The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity rose in November to its best showing since April 2011, while the pace of hiring in the sector also accelerated. In addition, construction spending increased 0.8 percent in October, the highest since May 2009. Mining companies’ shares fell in sync with a slide in precious metal prices. Gold dropped 2.6 percent. Silver  tumbled 4.2 percent. Hecla Mining Co lost 6.1 percent to $2.77 while U.S. shares of Silvercorp Metals sank 5.1 percent to $2.41. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc fell 1.2 percent to $34.26.

The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 14.63 points, or 0.36 percent, to close at 4,045.26. Dow component 3M Co fell 4.4 percent to $127.68 after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to “underweight” from “equal weight.” On the upside, Forest Laboratories Inc jumped 9.8 percent to $56.32 as the S&P; 500’s biggest percentage gainer after the company said it plans to buy rights to a new schizophrenia treatment from Merck & Co and cut annual operating costs by $500 million in fiscal 2016.

127,MMM,"3M sets year's biggest U.S. buyback plan, raises dividend","(Reuters) - 3M Co, whose products range from Post-It notes to films used in flat-panel TVs, said it could buy back up to $22 billion of shares in the five years through 2017, joining a list of companies announcing big capital returns to shareholders. 3M’s repurchase plan brings the total buyback authorizations announced by U.S. companies this year to about $460 billion, the highest since 2007 and the onset of the global financial crisis. The company’s shares rose as much as 3 percent after it also raised its quarterly dividend by a third and said it would spend between $5 billion and $10 billion on acquisitions through 2017. Morgan Stanley analyst Nigel Coe said the dividend increase signaled confidence, while the acquisition plans represented “a major shift in tone from this historically conservative team.” 3M said on Tuesday it expected its 2013-2017 share repurchases to be in the range of $17 billion to $22 billion, up from its previous estimate of $7.5 billion to $15 billion. The top end of the new range represents about 25 percent of 3M’s market value - making its plan the largest possible capital return in percentage terms among U.S. companies that have announced buybacks this year. Other companies announcing big buybacks this year include Microsoft Corp, Boeing Co and Deere & Co. Companies typically buy back shares to increase the value of the stock remaining. However, share prices of many companies, including 3M, are at or near record highs. “At this point in time, there does appear to be excess cash (and) corporations do not want to sit on such a large asset, especially considering the low return that their market instruments are making,” S&P; Dow Jones Indices analyst Howard Silverblatt told Reuters. 3M did not say how it would fund the buyback. It had cash and equivalents of about $2.3 billion as of September 30. JP Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa noted that 3M’s repurchase plan translated to only about $4 billion per year. 3M said in July it expected 2013 share repurchases to be in the range of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion. The company said on Tuesday it would raise its quarterly dividend to 88.5 cents from 63.5 cents, which works out to an additional payout of $585 million if maintained for a year. St. Paul, Minnesota-based 3M forecast 2014 organic sales to rise by 3-6 percent, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. Analysts on average were expecting the company to report 2013 revenue of $31.01 billion. 3M said it expected earnings of between $7.30 and $7.55 per share next year.

China is to “declare war” on pollution, with the government unveiling detailed measures to tackle what has become a hot-button social issue.

Shares of Apple Inc, the most valuable U.S. company by market capitalization, jumped 8.2 percent to $567.77, the  biggest gain since August, a day after the company posted revenue that far outpaced expectations. Apple also approved another $30 billion stock-buyback plan, raised its dividend and authorized a seven-for-one stock split. The S&P; information technology index rose 1.1 percent and was the best-performing sector of the day. The three major U.S. stock indexes had opened sharply higher, with the Nasdaq initially climbing more than 1 percent before turning negative in the first half-hour of trading. Wall Street bounced off session lows with gains again concentrated in the Nasdaq, but stocks finished the day well off earlier highs. Much of the volatility was driven by comments from Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, who said Russia started military drills near the border with Ukraine. Ukrainian forces killed up to five pro-Moscow rebels as they closed in on the separatists’ military stronghold in the east. “The market is biased - from all of the good news we’ve heard on stocks recently - to go higher,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. “However, there are hot spots in the world that keep flaring up like a campfire that won’t go out, and the market needs to deal with that.” Caterpillar Inc rose 1.8 percent to $105.28 after the company reported better-than-expected earnings and raised its full-year profit outlook. Limiting the Dow’s advance were Verizon Communications Inc  and 3M Co, whose shares fell after the companies’ results missed expectations. Verizon dropped 2.4 percent to $46.28, while 3M fell 1 percent to $136.65. The S&P; telecom index lost 1.7 percent. The index has dropped 3.8 percent over the past two days, its worst two-session performance since June. The Dow Jones industrial average remained unchanged to close at 16,501.65. The S&P; 500 gained 3.22 points or 0.17 percent, to 1,878.61. The Nasdaq Composite added 21.372 points or 0.52 percent, to end at 4,148.338. After the close, Microsoft Corp shares rose 2.4 percent to $40.40 after the world’s largest software company posted third-quarter results. Amazon.com Inc advanced 0.5 percent to $338.89 in extended-hours trading after the online retailer reported a 32 percent jump in first-quarter net income and a 23 percent rise in revenue. Facebook Inc reported a 72 percent jump in first-quarter revenue, lifted by its mobile advertising business, after the closing bell on Wednesday. The stock darted between positive and negative territory during the session before closing down 0.8 percent at $60.87. Profits are seen rising 2.9 percent this quarter, down from the 6.5 percent growth rate estimated at the start of the year, but above the low of 0.6 percent seen last week, according to Thomson Reuters data. Zimmer Holdings Inc agreed to buy Biomet Inc  in a deal valued at about $13.35 billion to broaden its portfolio of products that treat bone and joint-related disorders. Zimmer’s stock surged 11.5 percent to $101.97. A number of cloud-computing stocks, which have struggled lately but rose last week, opened higher and then quickly sold off. Workday Inc slid 5.3 percent to $72.59 while Salesforce.com fell 1.6 percent to $54.73.

152,MMM,3M to buy Sumitomo stake for $885 million to control Japan business,"(Reuters) - 3M Co (MMM.N) will pay about $885 million for Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd’s (5802.T) stake in their Japan joint venture, giving the diversified U.S. manufacturer full control of the business, 3M said on Wednesday. The deal is expected to add about 8 cents per share to earnings in the first 12 months after it closes, 3M said. Analysts, on average, expect 3M to earn $7.46 per share in 2014, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company will buy Sumitomo’s 25 percent stake in the Sumitomo 3M Ltd subsidiary for 90 billion Japanese yen. The cash transaction will give 3M 100 percent ownership upon the expected closing of the deal in September. 3M’s share of earnings from Japan will rise to 10 percent from 9 percent previously due to the transaction, analysts at William Blair estimated.  “While Japan may be growth challenged, the business is profitable and strong for 3M,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Steven Winoker wrote in a research note. The joint venture was formed in 1961 between 3M, Sumitomo and NEC Corp (6701.T). 3M acquired NEC’s stake in 2003, increasing 3M’s interest to 75 percent. 3M has said it plans to spend $5 billion to $10 billion on acquisitions through 2017, including possible “multibillion-dollar” transactions that could exceed its previous deal sizes of as much as $1 billion apiece. 3M shares were up 0.2 percent to $145.37 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

The day’s advance put the S&P; 500 at its highest level in two weeks as results from industrial bellwethers reassured investors that corporations can generate strong profits despite concerns about global growth. Still, the S&P; finished about 0.6 percent below its intraday high after news that a healthcare worker who returned to the United States from West Africa had a fever and gastrointestinal symptoms. “The headline risk caused sellers to be more active. That subsided after about 20 minutes and the real impact won’t be known until tomorrow morning,” said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. “It threw a little scare into the market.” Caterpillar Inc’s profit beat forecasts and the machinery maker raised its full-year profit forecast. Shares of the Dow component jumped 5 percent to $99.27. 3M Co added 4.4 percent to $145.05. 3M’s results were driven by U.S. sales and its CEO called the U.S. economy “improved.” The S&P; industrial sector climbed 2.2 percent, the day’s biggest advancing sector. “If we’re looking at headwinds like currency and slowing global growth, seeing multinationals like Caterpillar and 3M post solid beats gives us confidence that economic growth is holding on and probably better than the market is currently expecting,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 216.58 points, or 1.32 percent, to 16,677.9, the S&P; 500 gained 23.71 points, or 1.23 percent, to 1,950.82 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 69.95 points, or 1.6 percent, to 4,452.79. On the downside, AT&T; Inc fell 2.4 percent to $33.66, a day after reporting weaker-than-expected revenue growth.  Yelp Inc slumped 18.6 percent to $57.17 in heavy trading a day after its revenue outlook disappointed. After the close, Amazon.com Inc’s sales projections for the holiday quarter disappointed and results missed targets, sending shares 9 percent lower. Despite those disappointments, this earnings season has largely been positive for companies. With more than a third of the S&P; 500’s results in, 69.5 percent have exceeded profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, above the long-term average of 63 percent.

The advance continued a recent bout of strength for equities. The S&P; 500 has posted a gain of 0.9 percent or more in four of the past five sessions, putting it less than 3 percent from its record close. After a four-week string of declines, the S&P; is up 3.5 percent this week, on track for its biggest weekly advance since January 2013. Shares of both Caterpillar Inc and 3M Co  rose following their results. Caterpillar, which also raised its full-year profit view, was up 5.3 percent at $99.61 while 3M added 5.6 percent to $146.70. The S&P; industrial sector climbed 2.4 percent as the biggest advancing sector on the day. “It’s good to see good numbers in any company, but if we’re looking at headwinds like currency and slowing global growth, seeing multinationals like Caterpillar and 3M post solid beats gives us confidence that economic growth is holding on and probably better than the market is currently expecting,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York. On the downside, AT&T; Inc fell 3 percent to $33.47, a day after reporting weaker-than-expected revenue growth.  The results pressured the telecom sector , which lost 1.5 percent as the only one of the 10 primary S&P; 500 sectors down on the day. Yelp Inc slumped 15 percent to $59.40 in heavy trading a day after giving a revenue outlook that was below expectations. Many analysts cut their price targets on the stock. This season has largely been positive for companies. With 35 percent of the S&P; 500 having reported, 69.5 percent have exceeded profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, above the long-term average of 63 percent. New claims for U.S. unemployment benefits held below 300,000 for a sixth straight week last week, suggesting the labor market was shrugging off jitters over a slowing global economy. At 12:55 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average rose 238.38 points, or 1.45 percent, to 16,699.7, the S&P; 500  gained 25.94 points, or 1.35 percent, to 1,953.05 and the Nasdaq Composite added 72.24 points, or 1.65 percent, to 4,455.08.

163,MMM,"GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks surge on U.S. corporate results, bonds fall","* European shares rebound despite regional earnings drag * Upbeat German and U.S. economic reports force bonds lower * Oil rises above $85 a barrel on Saudi supply cut   (Adds close of European bond, stock markets) By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Global equity markets rose on Thursday, with stocks on Wall Street surging more than 1 percent as U.S. corporate earnings continued to beat expectations, while government debt prices fell on encouraging American and German economic reports. Results from Caterpillar Inc and 3M Co, both Dow components, reassured investors that companies with large overseas revenue streams can deliver solid profits despite concerns about global economic growth. Shares of Caterpillar, which raised its full-year earnings outlook, rose 5.0 percent, while 3M shares jumped 5.9 percent. The surge put the benchmark S&P; 500 index up 3.6 percent for this week, reversing four straight weeks of decline, and on track for its biggest weekly gain since January 2013. “If we’re looking at headwinds like currency and slowing global growth, seeing multinationals like Caterpillar and 3M post solid beats gives us confidence that economic growth is holding on and probably better than the market is currently expecting,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York. With 177 of the S&P; 500 companies having posted third-quarter results, 69.5 percent have beaten expectations, better than the 67 percent beat rate over the past four quarters, and higher than the 20-year average of 63 percent, Thomson Reuters data show. The surge on Wall Street helped turn around European stocks, which initially fell on weak results from some companies, including French tire-maker Michelin, despite support from better-than-expected euro zone business activity data. Michelin closed down 4.9 percent. MSCI’s all-country world index, which gauges equity performance in 45 countries, rose 0.75 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 of leading regional companies rebounded to close up 0.65 percent at 1,317.28. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 261.96 points, or 1.59 percent, at 16,723.28. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up 27.95 points, or 1.45 percent, at 1,955.06. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 76.79 points, or 1.75 percent, at 4,459.64. Bond prices fell, with German government bond yields higher after the unexpected uptick in euro zone business surveys staved off fears the bloc could be headed for a triple-dip recession. U.S. Treasury yields climbed to their highest levels in over a week after weekly jobless claims fell to the lowest since late 2000. The yield on 10-year German Bunds rose almost 4 basis points to 0.902 percent, while Bund futures  fell 38 ticks to settle at 150.26. Ten-year U.S. Treasuries fell 18/32 in price to yield 2.2926 percent. The dollar see-sawed against the euro and pushed higher against the yen. The euro rebounded off two-week lows, rising 0.09 percent to $1.2659. The dollar rose 1.0 percent to 108.21 yen. Brent crude oil rose above $85 a barrel on news Saudi Arabia cut supply to the market in September, even though its overall production grew month on month, and on strong economic data from Europe and China. OPEC’s largest producer pumped 9.7 million barrels per day in September, up from around 9.6 million in August, an industry source said on Thursday. Brent crude for December was up $1.83 at $86.54 a barrel. U.S. front-month crude was up $1.18 at $81.70.

165,MMM,"3M posts strong U.S. sales, margins as profit tops estimates","(Reuters) - Diverse U.S. manufacturer 3M Co (MMM.N) posted a 5.8 percent rise in quarterly profit on Thursday that topped estimates, driven by a jump in U.S. sales and cost controls as well as strong pricing that helped boost margins. Shares of 3M, a Dow Jones industrial average component, rose 6.2 percent. The well-received third-quarter results overshadowed its narrower full-year financial targets, a move the company attributed in part to more negative currency impacts. 3M, a maker of adhesives, abrasives and other products for a variety of industries, derives more than 60 percent of its sales from outside the United States, and some analysts had braced for a difficult quarter amid uncertain economies in Europe and Latin America. Sales, excluding the impact from foreign currency translation, rose 3.9 percent. Such organic sales growth, closely watched by Wall Street, slowed from the second quarter but was ahead of the expectations of some analysts. U.S. sales rose 6 percent, leading geographic regions for 3M, whose best-known brands include Scotch tape and Post-it notes. “The economy has improved, and we are able to capitalize on that,” 3M Chief Executive Officer Inge Thulin told analysts on a conference call. 3M shares were up $8.60 at $147.55 in late-morning trading. With Thursday’s climb, the company’s stock has risen some 4 percent this year, outperforming most other diversified U.S. manufacturers, whose shares have been dragged down by concerns over the shaky global economy. Third-quarter net income rose 5.9 percent to $1.3 billion, or $1.98 per share. Analysts, on average, looked for $1.96 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales were up 2.8 percent to $8.14 billion. Analysts expected $8.24 billion. Its operating profit margin stood at 23.4 percent, up 1.4 percentage points from a year earlier and ahead of the 22.8 percent expected by Sanford Bernstein analyst Steven Winoker. “This was a strong operational quarter,” Winoker said in a research note, pointing to “very strong margin expansion on top of already high margins.” The company projected full-year profit in the range of $7.40 to $7.50 per share, compared to $7.30 to $7.55 previously.   Analysts had been looking for 2014 earnings of $7.46 per share. The company said the effects of movements in foreign currencies will cut sales by 1.5 percent for the year, compared to 3M’s earlier view of a 1 percent reduction.

167,MMM,GLOBAL MARKETS-U.S. stock futures tumble on reports of NY Ebola case,"* Risk sentiment hit by first Ebola case in NY * Caterpillar, 3M earnings underpin sentiment * U.S. and euro zone economic data positive * European shares seen falling 0.5-0.7 pct By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Oct 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures tumbled while safe-haven assets such as the yen and U.S. bonds gained on Friday after a doctor who returned to New York City from West Africa tested positive for Ebola. S&P; 500 mini futures fell as much as 0.7 percent, slipping from two-week highs hit the previous day on budding optimism from corporate earnings and the global economy. European shares looked set to slip, with France’s CAC 40 seen falling by as much as 0.7 percent and Germany’s DAX  and Britain’s FTSE by 0.5 percent. In Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.1 percent, though Japan’s Nikkei share average bucked the trend rising 1.0 percent, led by gains in drug companies. “Just when markets got some relief on the world economy, we had this news. Obviously people who have just made bullish bets (on the economy) will close their positions as no one can tell exactly what is going to happen,” said the head of currency trading at a Western bank’s Tokyo branch. The first diagnosed case of Ebola in the world financial hub of New York sent investors rushing to traditional safe-haven assets. As U.S. bond prices gained, the 10-year U.S. yield fell back to 2.250 percent from Thursday’s two-week high of 2.300 percent . In the currency market, the yen gained 0.3 percent to 107.95 yen to the dollar. Risk asset prices had risen on Thursday after upbeat U.S. corporate earnings, solid U.S. economic data, and an unexpected uptick in euro zone business sentiment helped ease concerns that the global economy was losing momentum. Results from Caterpillar Inc and 3M Co  reassured investors that companies with large overseas revenue streams could deliver solid profits, despite concerns about global economic growth. The markets had ignored positive earnings earlier this month, when the world’s share prices hit multi-month lows, overwhelmed by fears that sluggishness in Europe and Asia could deal a severe blow to the U.S. economy as well. But a steady flow of solid earnings helped to ease many such concerns for now. With 177 of the S&P; 500 companies having posted third-quarter results, 69.5 percent have beaten expectations, better than the 67 percent beat rate over the past four quarters, and higher than the 20-year average of 63 percent, Thomson Reuters data showed. New claims for U.S. unemployment benefits also held below 300,000 for a sixth straight week last week. In the euro zone, a survey showed businesses performed much better than anyone expected this month, even though it also pointed to strong deflationary pressure in the region. The euro drew some support from the surprise strength in the euro zone data, but was still near a two-week low of $1.2614 hit on Thursday. It last stood at $1.2657. Investors are turning cautious ahead of Sunday’s release of the European Central Bank’s stress test results on the euro zone’s 130 biggest banks. In addition, some focus could fall on the parliamentary election in Ukraine on Sunday. Stability could benefit the European economy, which has suffered from the fall in trade with Russia on tit-for-tat sanctions between the West and Moscow. “I suspect one often overlooked reason for the market’s rebound since the middle of this week was signs of easing tensions between Russia and Ukraine,” said Soichiro Monji, chief strategist at Daiwa SB Investments, pointing to progress in gas talks between Russia and Ukraine last week. President Petro Poroshenko’s bloc holds a big lead, but if the populist Oleh Lyashko’s Radical party makes a very strong showing, Poroshenko may have the awkward task of seeking the support of a politician who has been sharply critical of his peace plan and his contacts with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Sunday will also see presidential election in Brazil, where stocks and the currency have suffered on expectations that the current President Dilma Rousseff is likely to beat her rival, Aecio Neves, who is seen as more market-friendly. The Bovespa stock index hit a six-month low while the Brazilian real slumped to a 9-1/2-year low on Thursday.

The company derives more than 60 percent of sales from outside the United States. Greater China area, which represents about 20 percent of international sales, continues to represent the biggest growth opportunity for 3M in the next three years, the company said. It said it expects to end 2014 with sales of $4 billion in Greater China and forecast sales of $5-$5.5 billion in the region by 2017. 3M forecast gross share repurchases of $3 billion-$5 billion in 2015.

174,MMM,3M may remove Venezuelan assets from balance sheet,"(Reuters) - 3M Co, the diversified manufacturer, said it may remove assets in Venezuela from its balance sheets because of problems related to exchanging the South American’s country’s bolivar currency. 3M’s operations in Venezuela are small, representing less than 1 percent of consolidated operating profit in 2014. The company said Venezuela-related receivables are less than $20 million.   “A need to deconsolidate the company’s Venezuelan subsidiary’s operations may result from a lack of exchangeability” of its currency, “coupled with an acute degradation in the ability to make key operational decisions due to government regulations in Venezuela,” 3M said in its annual report filed on Thursday with U.S. regulators. 3M was not immediately available for comment. Venezuela has been a tough place to do business for large U.S. companies because of its 64 percent annual inflation, plunging oil revenue and unstable currency. Automaker Ford Motor Co last month blamed Venezuela’s currency devaluation plans as one reason for removing its operations there from its financial reports.  Clorox Co last year exited Venezuela altogether. And toy maker Mattel Inc may close operations there if economic or political conditions significantly worsen.

177,MMM,UPDATE 3-Asahi Kasei eyes electric car growth with $2.2 bln Polypore battery deal,"* Asahi Kasei seeking to boost car battery parts business * 3M buys Polypore’s separations media operation for $1 billion * Asahi Kasei looking for more acquisition opportunities   (Adds analyst comment, details on 3M) By Taiga Uranaka TOKYO, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Japanese chemical manufacturer Asahi Kasei Corp has agreed to buy Polypore International Inc’s energy storage business for $2.2 billion, betting on growth in demand for hybrid and electric cars. Both companies produce lithium-ion battery separators used in electronic gadgets and automobiles, but Asahi Kasei President Toshio Asano believes that the type produced by U.S.-based Polypore - known as dry process separators - will become the auto sector’s preferred option because of lower costs. “We have been putting our resources in rechargeable batteries for personal computers and smart phones, but the next big market is electric and hybrid cars,” Asano told reporters on Monday. Asahi Kasei will acquire all outstanding shares of Polypore for $60.50 a share, a 14 percent premium to their $52.95 close on Friday and representing an enterprise value of about $3.2 billion. Polypore’s shares rose as high as $59.81 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Before the acquisition, 3M Co will buy the assets of Polypore’s separations media business for about $1 billion and Asahi Kasei will receive the cash proceeds from the sale. {ID:nBw9J4bP2a] “With a high level of overlap with 3M’s existing business, we would expect the deal to generate synergies and to expand 3M’s presence in relatively fast-growing markets with high barriers to entry,” Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Steven Winoker wrote in a client note. Polypore’s separation media business, which makes microporous membranes and filtration modules, will be merged with 3M’s purification business. The U.S. company, known for its Post-It notes, said it expected Polypore’s business to add 4 cents per share to earnings, excluding one-time items, in the first year. Polypore’s energy storage operation achieved sales of $442 million and EBITDA of $116 million in 2013, Asahi Kasei said. Asked about possibility of further acquisitions, Asano said: “We would like to actively pursue (acquisitions) where there is a big strategic fit.” Asahi Kasei said it would draw on its cash reserves and new bridging loans. Primary Executive Officer Hideki Kobori said the company was not considering issuing equity or bonds to finance the acquisition. The transactions have been approved by the boards of directors of Asahi Kasei, 3M and Polypore. Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co was financial adviser to Asahi Kasei, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch advised Polypore. Centerview Partners LLC was 3M’s financial adviser.

178,MMM,Exclusive: Post-it note maker 3M unveils new paper sourcing policy,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - St. Paul-based 3M Co (MMM.N), one of the world’s largest manufacturers and the maker of Post-it notes, will take new steps to ensure that its suppliers of paper, pulp and packaging provide materials that come from sustainably logged timber.  The new paper-sourcing policy, aimed at preventing the destruction of forests, comes after pressure on 3M from environmental activists, who accused the company of outdated practices that jeopardized fragile forests. The company, which also manufacturers Scotch brand tape products, will now require some 5,000 direct suppliers, located in more than 70 countries, to provide data, including the source of their harvested wood fiber. The company says it may sever ties with suppliers that fail to meet its standards. While other companies have also set conservation standards for their suppliers, 3M’s action is expected to have broad ripple effects, because of the size of its supply network, said Todd Paglia, executive director at ForestEthics, a forest and climate advocacy organization. ForestEthics, which led a campaign against 3M, is now applauding the company’s new standards. “No other manufacturer has adopted such a rigorous policy with such reach around the world,” Paglia said. 3M is the latest company to take voluntary steps to reform its supply chain practices amid pressure from environmental groups. In January, Wilmar International Ltd (WLIL.SI), the  world’s largest palm oil processor, opened its supply chains to outside scrutiny in what environmentalists called an unprecedented step to help safeguard tropical forests. Under 3M’s policy, all paper-based products and packaging suppliers will be expected to harvest in ways that don’t threaten peatland ecosystems and intact forest landscapes. The policy also aims to protect dense, high-carbon stock forests and ensure the rights of indigenous peoples. The company said it developed its policy in collaboration with environmental groups. The company is working with a non-profit agency, The Forest Trust, to help make sure suppliers are not running afoul of conservation standards. Greenpeace has also hailed the new policy.  The company is in the process of reviewing its suppliers and says it will issue its first public progress report in May. “We are taking responsibility for making sure our pulp and paper suppliers meet the requirements of the policy, and help them to raise their performance if necessary,” said Jean Sweeney, 3M’s vice president of environmental, health, safety and sustainability operations The company also has created positions in each of its four regions around the world to oversee implementation of the paper-sourcing policy. The costs of implementing the policy are immaterial to earnings, according to 3M, which reported $31.8 billion in sales last year. ForestEthics ran a multi-year campaign against 3M that included a 40-foot Post-it note hung off a bridge near 3M’s headquarters. The fake “to-do list” sign included the words “destroy forests” with a checkmark next to it.  Up to now, 3M has lacked a meaningful paper buying policy, said Rolf Skar, Greenpeace’s forest campaign director. Greenpeace had been working behind the scenes and was considering ramping up its campaign if 3M did not act, Skar said. “They probably heard the footsteps of an escalating campaign, but also see sustainability as a brand asset,” Skar said.  “It’s a good step forward,” Skar said. “The marketplace drives real change.” ",3052015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-3m-paper/exclusive-post-it-note-maker-3m-unveils-new-paper-sourcing-policy-idUSKBN0M119520150305

180,MMM,"Russia's M.video may shut more, open fewer new stores in 2015","MOSCOW, March 26 (Reuters) - Russian consumer electronics retailer M.video may shut more stores in 2015 than last year while opening fewer new outlets, it said on Thursday, as consumer demand shrinks in the weakening economy. The company got a boost in December when the rouble dropped sharply and consumers rushed to buy home appliances and cars to protect savings. The buying spree has proved short-lived though and retailers of durable goods are now facing a slump in demand. M.video plans to open up to 25 stores this year and could close up to 10, chief executive and biggest shareholder Alexander Tynkovan said on a conference call. Last year, it opened 39 while closing four and its capital expenditure stood at 4.3 billion roubles ($75 million). “Our feeling is that this year there could be some reduction of the market,” Tynkovan said, adding that M.video, which ended 2014 with a net cash position of 26 billion roubles ($454 million), still hoped to gain market share from weaker competitors. “Some companies already stepped away from this business at the beginning of this year and we expect that others can also reduce their operations. We are going to use this opportunity to increase our market share - it’s our main, main focus,” he said. Tynkovan said 2015 capex would not exceed last year’s level. He gave no revenue guidance but said the company remained committed to paying 60 percent of net profit in dividends. M.video had earlier on Thursday reported a 39 percent jump in 2014 net profit and a 16 percent rise in sales to 203 billion roubles. “The results are not of much relevance and cannot be extrapolated to 2015. We believe there will be a significant drop in the consumer electronics market this year,” said Maria Kolbina, an analyst at VTB Capital.

181,MMM,"UPDATE 1-What to Watch in the Week Ahead and on Monday, April 20","(Adds events for Verizon, AT&T;, Canadian National Railway and Rogers Communications) Week Ahead A slew of Dow 30 companies report results in the week: Chemicals conglomerate DuPont, industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corp, property and casualty insurer Travelers Companies Inc and wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc on Tuesday; McDonald’s Corp, AT&T; Inc, Boeing Co and Coca-Cola Co on Wednesday; and diversified manufacturer 3M Co, Procter & Gamble and Microsoft Corp on Thursday. While DuPont is expected to report lower first-quarter results, Travelers Companies Inc’s first-quarter results are expected to be in line with estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Investors will keep an eye out for details on Verizon’s upcoming mobile video service and capital expenditure range and will look for updates on AT&T;’s proposed $48.5 billion deal to buy DirectTV, which is under regulatory review. Boeing faces fears of an aircraft downturn after it booked record orders in 2014, while Steve Easterbrook, McDonald’s new CEO, is charged with reviving the company’s falling sales and managing negative PR around the healthiness of its food. Investors will be watching the impact of the strong dollar on 3M’s first-quarter results and Microsoft is expected to report sharply lower profit for its third quarter as sales of personal computers remain soggy. Search engine giant Google Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts’ estimate on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Google, which has been officially charged of cheating consumers and competitors by the European Union, is also being investigated for its Android mobile operating system. Analysts say the latter could prove a bigger threat to Google’s future profitability. Analysts expect foreign exchange to negatively impact revenues in the first quarter even as paid click growth is poised to decelerate again. Facebook Inc is expected to post a first-quarter profit above Wall Street’s expectations on Wednesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The world’s largest social network’s business has been booming thanks to its mobile ads on smartphones and tablets. Many investors also expect that video ads will provide the company’s next leg of growth. Facebook has also been stepping up efforts to expand products like messaging service WhatsApp and photo-sharing service Instagram. Investors will be looking out for the company’s outlook for the remainder of 2015. On Thursday, the e-commerce company Amazon.com Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue largely in line with analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. However, analysts are expecting margins to improve as the company gets a grip on a slew of investments on everything from Hollywood-style television productions to cloud computing and consumer devices. On Tuesday, Yahoo Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts’ estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, as its overall share of U.S. desktop searches declines. Analysts and investors will be looking out for any details on the tax-free sale of its Alibaba shares. General Motors Co reports first-quarter results before the market opens on Thursday. Analysts are expecting 96 cents per share, up sharply from a year before. On Wednesday, chipmaker Qualcomm Inc is likely to report second-quarter revenue and profit broadly in line with analysts’ average estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Qualcomm lowered its outlook for fiscal 2015 in January, saying it did not expect its newest Snapdragon mobile chip to be used in a major customer’s flagship smartphone. Samsung opted for its own mobile processor and modem chip in the Galaxy S6 instead of equivalents from Qualcomm. The chipmaker had also warned that “challenges” with another of its chips had hurt its competitiveness in China. Qualcomm recently came under pressure from hedge fund Jana Partners to spin off its chip business from its patent-licensing business. Credit Suisse reports earnings for the first three months of 2015 on Tuesday. Meanwhile, on Friday the Swiss bank will ask shareholders to sign off in a symbolic vote on executive pay for 2014, when Credit Suisse became the largest bank in decades to plead guilty to a U.S. criminal charge and will pay more than $2.5 billion in penalties for helping Americans evade taxes. Investors will focus on existing home sales on Wednesday, which is expected to have increased 3.0 percent to an annual rate of 5.05 million units. Also, data for new home sales is expected to be released on Thursday. On Friday, the U.S. Commerce Department releases data for durable goods. Starbucks Corp reports its second-quarter results on Thursday. Starbucks is one of the restaurant industry’s top performers, but investors and analysts worry that its streak of red-hot growth is coming to an end. The company has a variety of plans in place to boost sales (adding booze, smoothies, more lunch and dinner options, improving and expanding tea selections and testing delivery) and investors will be looking for proof that those are working. On Tuesday, Yum Brands Inc will report its first-quarter results. Yum’s China business remains in the spotlight as it fights to recover from the latest food scandal in its biggest market. Analysts say the company is suffering from “brand fatigue” in China, where competition is mounting and its image has been hurt by food scares that have raised doubts over its supply chain. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc is slated to announce results for the first quarter on Tuesday. Chipotle is still having problems finding pork suppliers to replace the one it suspended for running afoul of its animal welfare rules. The company says customers have simply switched to other meats and that it isn’t losing sales - but investors will be on alert for any signs of a slowdown. Drugmaker Biogen Inc is expected to report a higher first-quarter profit on Friday, driven by strong sales of its top-selling oral MS drug, Tecfidera, which has seen burgeoning sales since its launch in 2013. Biogen, which leads the United States multiple sclerosis market with five drugs for the condition, recently reported promising data for its Alzheimer’s drug. Investors will also be looking for commentary on Tecfider’s growth expectations, and potential for competition, as well as the longer-acting MS injectable Plegridy. AbbVie Inc, whose planned $21 billion acquisition of Pharmacyclics Inc is meant to lessen the company’s dependence on its blockbuster Humira arthritis drug, is expected to report sharply higher earnings and sales for the first quarter on Thursday, fueled by Humira’s continuing growth and sales of the company’s recently approved Viekira Pak treatment for hepatitis C. Investors will be keen for details on sales prospects for Viekira Pak, given steep price discounts AbbVie has given to compete with Gilead Science Inc’s potent treatments for the liver disease. Eli Lilly and Co is expected to report higher first-quarter earnings on Thursday as the Indianapolis drugmaker begins to recover from patent expirations that slashed demand for its biggest products. The company is well positioned to deliver a promised return to profit growth this year, helped by new treatments for cancer and diabetes and growing sales of its animal health brands. Abbott Laboratories will report its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Recovering sales of Abbott Laboratories’ infant formulas, following costly recalls in Asia, and improving performance of the company’s branded generic medicines, are expected to drive quarterly earnings growth despite the negative impact of the stronger dollar. Ebay Inc is expected to report results for the first quarter largely in line with Wall Street expectations on Wednesday. The company has seen strong growth in payments business as well as its non-auction e-commerce business. Analysts expect that the company will continue to benefit from the rise in demand for mobile devices, as consumers increasingly use their smart phones and tablets to shop online. Investors will look for details on the company’s plans for the spinoff of PayPal scheduled for the second half of 2015. On Thursday, Dow Chemical Co is expected to report a lower first-quarter profit due to a stronger dollar and a slowdown in its agricultural business. The company last month said it would offload a bulk of its low-margin bleach and vinyl-related business to Olin in a $5 billion. Investors will be looking for further comments on the company’s cost-saving plans. Johnson Controls Inc, the auto parts supplier and maker of climate control systems for buildings, is expected to report higher second-quarter profit on Thursday, driven by higher sales in its seating and interiors business as auto sales and production rose in the first quarter. The company’s buildings efficiency business, which provides air conditioning equipment and building management services, is also expected to report higher revenue as U.S. office vacancy rate declined to its lowest level since the third quarter to 2009. Investors will be looking for comments on Johnson Controls’ business focus and outlook following the sale of its workplace solutions business to CBRE Group. Pentagon’s No. 1 arms supplier, Lockheed Martin Corp, reports first-quarter results on Tuesday. Lockheed Martin has been focusing on increasing sales to commercial customers in United States as well as international governments to make up for pressures from tight U.S. defense spending. Lockheed gets 17 percent of its revenue from international markets and 1 percent from U.S. commercial customers. Investors will be looking to see if Lockheed still expects U.S. military spending to meaningfully pick up this year. Weapons maker Raytheon Co has increased exposure to international markets, which account for about 27 percent of its total sales, as U.S. defense spending remains tight. The maker of the Tomahawk missile and the Patriot missile defense system forecast disappointing 2015 revenue in January as domestic orders remained weak. When the company will report its first-quarter results on Thursday, investors will be looking for an update on a $2 billion order for the Patriot missile defense system that Raytheon expected to win in the first quarter. On Tuesday, Omnicom Group Inc, the No. 1 U.S. advertising company, is expected to report first-quarter results largely in-line with analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Omnicom had warned that a strong dollar would hit revenue this year. Omnicom, whose clients include Apple, McDonald’s and Adidas, gets a little less than half of its revenue from outside the United States. On Friday, Interpublic Group of Companies Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts’ average estimate according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company’s previous quarter was helped by higher ad spending by businesses in the United States. On Tuesday, chipmaker Broadcom Corp is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts’ estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Analysts expect the company’s connectivity business to sequentially decline as it comes off a strong Apple-driven fourth quarter. Analysts will be looking for the company to provide outlook for the quarter ending June. On Wednesday, data storage company EMC Corp is expected to report first-quarter profit and revenue below analysts’ estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company had in January forecast a lower-than-expected profit for 2015 and said it would cut jobs. The company, which earns nearly half of its revenue from international markets, is expected to be hurt by a strong dollar. Analysts say enterprise storage demand has been mixed in quarter which may hurt EMC. Virtualization software maker VMware Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts’ estimate on Tuesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, hurt by a stronger dollar. More than 48 percent of VMware’s revenue comes from outside the United States. Analysts at Wells Fargo estimate a negative impact of 3-4 percent from foreign currency on license revenue growth. Programmable chip maker Xilinx Inc will report fourth-quarter results after markets close on Wednesday. The company, which dominates the programmable chip market along with Altera Corp, is expected to report profit and revenue that are largely in line with analyst expectations, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Investors will look for updates on sales to the broadcast, consumer and automotive end market and sales to communications and data center customers. PulteGroup Inc’s first-quarter results are expected to be released on Thursday. Coming on the heels of larger peer D.R. Horton’s second-quarter results on Wednesday, PulteGroup’s results are expected to provide further evidence of a strong spring selling season this year, suggesting that a slowdown in housing starts in the first three months did not point to underlying weakness in the U.S. housing market. Steelmaker Nucor Corp will report first-quarter results on Thursday. Nucor has been struggling with lower selling prices due to high levels of imports. Declining oil prices have also led to excess inventory in Nucor’s pipe and tube business. Analysts will be looking for comments on inventory, steel demand and overcapacity in its steel mills business. On Thursday, Patterson-UTI Energy Inc, the second-largest land driller in North America, is expected to report a lower first-quarter profit as weak oil prices weigh on drilling activity. Patterson, which halved its rig construction program for this year, had warned that 2015 would be “challenging,” having received indications that customers could terminate a number of longer-term contracts early. Investors will be looking for updates on further cost saving measures and commentary on contracts and dayrates for its 16 new high-tech Apex rigs, which analysts believe could help the driller boost cash margins this year. Contract driller Nabors Industries Ltd, which is merging with C&J; Energy, is expected to report on Tuesday a lower profit in the first quarter as drilling activity continues to be hurt by the fall in oil prices. The company has already warned of weak activity and pricing pressure in its international operations. Investors will be looking for updates on any job cuts and the company’s plans to idle rigs in an oversupplied market. On Tuesday, coal miner Arch Coal Inc is expected to report a ninth straight quarterly loss and on Thursday, coal miner Peabody Energy Corp is expected to report a wider first-quarter loss due to continued weakness in coal prices. Kimberly-Clark Corp, the maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers, is expected to report better-than-expected first-quarter sales, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, helped by growing demand in emerging markets such as Brazil, China and South Africa. However, higher input costs and a stronger dollar could have hurt profit. The company said in February it would transfer pension obligations to two insurers to reduce risk and will take a charge in the second quarter. It had also warned of an 8-9 percent drop in 2015 sales hurt by the dollar and weak demand for core products such as Huggies diapers. Investors will be looking for any updates on forecast on Tuesday. Hershey Co, the maker of Hershey’s Kisses and Reese’s peanut butter cups, has been struggling with high cocoa and dairy costs and intense competition from rivals such as Mondelez and Mars. To tackle growing competition, the company has been pouring money in advertisements and promotions, but this is expected to hurt its full-year earnings per share by 2 percentage points. It has also tried to diversify and add a new stream of revenue by acquiring jerky maker Krave Pure Foods Inc in January, marking its first foray into meat snacks. When the company will report its first-quarter profit on Thursday, investors will be looking out for comments on whether the company will make more acquisitions in the meat and bakery snacks category, which are becoming more popular than candy, and the effect of the strong dollar on its outlook. Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc will report its first-quarter results on Thursday. Investors will be looking at how much Boston’s record snowfall hurt results at Dunkin Brands, whose Dunkin’ Donuts shops are concentrated in the U.S. northeast. Experts say the impact could be meaningful. Under Armour Inc, a sports apparel and footwear maker, is expected to report profit and sales for the first quarter in line with analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Analysts expect Under Armour to continue its 19-quarter streak of reporting more than 20 percent growth in revenue, helped by expanded offerings in sport and outdoor clothing, strong demand for its Speedform Apollo running shoes, new launches in basketball footwear and sponsorship deals. The company is also expected to benefit from investments in its fast-growing digital platform and from the acquisitions of fitness tracking apps Endomondo and MyFitnessPal. When the company will report on Tuesday, investors will look for an update to the full-year forecast and color on the performance of new launches in footwear. Hanesbrands Inc, the innerwear and apparel maker is expected to report first-quarter profit and sales above analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Analysts are projecting first-quarter sales growth of more than 15 percent as the company benefits from higher sales of sport and gym clothing at department stores, and the acquisition of DBApparel and Maidenform Brands. When the company reports on Thursday, investors will look for an update to the full-year forecast and more color on the company’s recent acquisition of college logo clothing maker Knights Apparel. Ingersoll-Rand Plc, the maker of Trane air conditioners and Thermo King refrigeration units, is expected to report a higher first-quarter profit on Thursday, driven by growth in global industrial and construction markets. Investors will be looking for the impact of a strong dollar on the company’s industrial business, which has a higher proportion of revenue coming from outside the United States. Investors will also be looking for an update on how much the weakness in oil prices has hurt the company’s newly acquired centrifugal compression business. Xerox Corp, which has been shifting its focus to IT services from making printers and copiers, is expected to report first-quarter revenue that is slightly below analysts’ estimate on Friday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Xerox had cut its profit forecast for 2015 for the second time after reporting its sixth-consecutive drop in revenue last quarter. In December, the company agreed to sell its IT outsourcing arm to Atos. Teck Resources Ltd, Canada’s largest diversified miner, is expected to report on Tuesday a lower profit in the first quarter as prices for both copper and steel-making coal remain depressed amid a fall in demand. The company in March denied media reports that it was in talks to merge with Chilean copper producer Antofagasta. Teck CEO also refuted speculations of a possible merger with HudBay Minerals or an acquisition of Zaldivar, a copper mine owned by Barrick Gold. Teck said in February it might reduce its dividend in July if the industry-wide production cuts fail to boost coal prices. Investors will be interested in any comments of a possible merger or acquisition and demand for steel-making coal. Car seat maker Lear Corp is expected to report higher first-quarter profit on Friday helped by strong demand in North America and a rise in vehicle production. Some analysts expect Lear to benefit from cheaper commodity prices and report higher margins. Investors will look for Lear’s comments on Mercato Capital seeking a split of the auto parts suppliers businesses. Investment bank and asset manager Lazard Ltd reports first-quarter earnings on Thursday. Lazard is expected to benefit from a jump in corporate dealmaking, which should have boosted its M&A; advisory business. Globally, deals worth $811.8 billion were announced in the first quarter, up 21 percent, compared to a year earlier. Among them, Lazard advised on the merger of Heinz-Kraft and the sale of Serbia’s state-operated Telekom Srbija. However, analysts expect lower-than-anticipated deal completions to weigh on the company’s quarterly revenue. Lazard has been focusing more on asset management to be less reliant on financial advisory fees. AutoNation Inc, the largest U.S. car dealer chain, reports first-quarter results on Wednesday. Investors will be watching margins on new car sales, any potential expansion moves and for any concerns about U.S. consumer spending going forward. On Thursday, Qlik Technologies Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue above analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, on higher demand for its data analytics software. The company had forecast full-year adjusted profit below analysts’ average estimate and its revenue forecast was also largely below Wall Street estimates. Touchscreen chipmaker Synaptics Inc is expected to report third-quarter profit below analysts’ estimate on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, on weak demand from smartphone makers. Analysts have said that certain Samsung designs that have come out recently are not using Synaptics touch IC products. Online music streaming service provider Pandora Media Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue above analysts’ average estimate on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company is expected to benefit from stronger listening hours and its gradual move into automobiles, where more than half of all radio listening occurs in the U.S. Investors will look for updates on user and local ad growth. On Wednesday, specialty mattress maker Select Comfort Corp is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts’ average estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, halting a run of four straight quarters where sales beat expectations. Investors will be looking out for the company’s Sleep Number mattress sales as well as for any changes in full-year outlook. The company provided 2015 profit forecast below estimates in February. On Friday, Apigee Corp, which develops software to manage web applications, is expected to raise up to $92 million in its IPO, valuing the company at about $523.8 million at the higher end of its IPO price range. The company’s software platform allows businesses to design and deploy application programming interfaces (API) to link its core IT systems with data used by customers, others. The company primarily offers application interface management and predictive analysis services. On Tuesday, Canadian Finance Minister Joe Oliver will present the annual federal budget for the fiscal year that began on April 1, the last budget before the general election scheduled for October. He has promised a balanced budget and has pledged to introduce balanced budget legislation as well. The Conservative government has already introduced a package of tax cuts and family benefits, and infrastructure spending, that has soaked up much of the anticipated surplus. A decline in oil prices has cut much of the remaining room for maneuver. Prime Minister Stephen Harper has ruled out major stimulus spending, arguing that despite cheap oil the economy was still growing. On Thursday Mexico’s national statistics office will release economic activity data for February, after the gauge expanded in January on a pickup in services and agriculture while industry sank. Also on Thursday, Mexico will release annual inflation data for the first half of April, after the indicator picked up to 3.14 in March, reaching just above the central bank’s 3 percent target. Retail sales data released on Friday will reveal how the gauge fared in February, after it rose at its fastest pace in over a year in January. Monday, April 20 International Business Machines Corp is expected to report lower revenue for the 12th straight quarter, as it exits unprofitable businesses and attempts to move into cloud-focused areas, away from its traditional hardware and consulting services foundation. Net profit for the first quarter is expected to rise slightly. Morgan Stanley is expected to report a rise in first-quarter earnings. The company’s institutional securities business now depends more on equities trading business, rather than fixed income trading. Rival Goldman Sachs’s strong performance in stock trading in the first quarter puts the spotlight on Morgan Stanley. The bank has also been focusing more on its wealth management business. It is trying to squeeze more revenue out of its major businesses by getting wealth clients to use investment banking and trading services. Ruth Porat, Morgan Stanley’s chief financial officer, who helped execute a sweeping cost-cutting strategy across several business lines at the bank, will step down to join Google as its finance chief next month. Halliburton Co is expected to report a lower first-quarter profit, hurt by soft drilling activity. Oil producers have significantly scaled back spending amid weak oil prices. However, cost cuts and continued strength in the Middle East and Asia are expected to help the oilfield services provider minimize the effects of the oil downturn. The company has said it would cut more than 6,000 jobs and investors will seek details about any further cost cuts, especially after Schlumberger cut 11,000 more jobs. Halliburton is looking to complete its $35 billion-acquisition of smaller rival Baker Hughes, which is expected to report its own first-quarter results on Tuesday. Investors will want to know about more potential asset sales after Halliburton said earlier it would sell three businesses to pave the way for regulatory clearance for the deal. Investors will also look to see if the deal will help it better cope with pricing pressure from oil producers. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd, the world’s second-largest cruise operator by revenue, is expected to report first-quarter profit and sales below analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company had forecast revenue below expectations, citing a strong dollar and weak pricing in the Caribbean. Investors will be looking out for any changes in full-year forecast and comments on the Caribbean market, as well as updates on expansion in Europe and Asia. Toymaker Hasbro Inc will report first-quarter results before the bell. The sequels of “Jurassic Park” and “The Avengers” in first half of 2015 and the new “Star Wars” movie in December are expected to boost Hasbro’s sales this year and keep it growing at a faster pace than larger rival Mattel Inc’s. Canadian National Railway reports its financial results for the first quarter. On average, analysts are expecting earnings to rise to 85 Canadian cents a share from 66 Canadian cents a year earlier, as revenue increases to C$3.04 billion. The company may discuss its safety record and the costs associated with its recent string of derailments as cleanup continues near the town of Gogama, in northern Ontario.  Rogers Communications Inc, Canada’s largest wireless phone provider and a major cable and media company, reports results for the first quarter. The company has lost ground in wireless and other subscriber metrics in recent quarters but has been able on average to charge its customers more, a trend investors will be eager to appraise.

183,MMM,Market darling 3M sees stock stumble with lowered outlook,"(Reuters) - For two years, 3M Co has been among the best bets in industrial stocks, with analysts swooning over its financial performance and desire to return cash to shareholders. That momentum stalled on Thursday. The maker of Post-it notes, adhesives and other products for various industries cut its profit forecast by about 2.5 percent for the year, as it posted a slight decline in first-quarter net profit. The stronger dollar, which hurts foreign sales when converted into the greenback, is expected to shave as much as 7 percent off of 3M’s 2015 sales, more than it previously expected. St Paul, Minnesota-based 3M generates more than 60 percent of its sales outside the United States. Excluding currency swings, 3M’s revenue growth of 3.3 percent trailed some analysts’ targets and slowed from the 6.3 percent the company reported for the fourth quarter.  3M shares fell 2.6 percent to $160.43 at mid-afternoon, after initially sliding as much as 3.7 percent. S&P; Capital IQ equity analyst Jim Corridore cut his rating on 3M stock to “sell” from “hold,” citing “a tough revenue environment with international weakness coupled with currency challenges.” Thursday’s selloff dented a big run for 3M shares. Although the stock had been roughly flat in 2015 through Wednesday, it is up some 49 percent over the past two years, outperforming other large diversified industrial manufacturers and a 34 percent rise for the Standard & Poor’s 500 index. 3M trades at 19.6 times forward 12 month earnings estimates, according to Thomson Reuters data, compared with 16.2 times for both Honeywell International Inc and United Technologies Corp. Noting 3M’s stock performance over the past two years, Sanford Bernstein analyst Steven Winoker in a research report earlier this week asked, “Who else can pull a 3M?” “Across industrial companies, 3M is a poster child for catalyzing stock performance by adding leverage to increase cash returns,” Winoker wrote. Other aspects of 3M’s performance on Thursday encouraged Wall Street. For example, it expanded operating profit margins by 0.9 percentage points to 22.8 percent, as it raised prices and lowered raw material costs. It also affirmed its target for growing revenue by 3 percent to 6 percent this year, excluding currency swings. “I would be telling people that this kind of (stock) weakness is likely temporary and buying the dip makes a ton of sense,” Edward Jones analyst Matt Arnold said.

185,MMM,3M cuts full-year profit outlook as strong dollar bites sales,"(Reuters) - U.S. manufacturer 3M Co (MMM.N) posted a 0.7 percent decline in quarterly net income on Thursday and cut its full-year profit forecast as the strong dollar bites into sales more than it previously projected. The maker of Post-it notes as well as adhesives, abrasives and other products for a variety of industries reported a 6.5 percent reduction from the stronger dollar, a sharper first-quarter hit than reported by other industrials such as Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) and United Technologies Corp (UTX.N). Strength in the dollar reduces foreign sales when they are translated back into the greenback. 3M shares, which have outperformed industrial rivals since 2014, fell 3.3 percent to $159.24 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The St. Paul, Minnesota-based company, which receives more than 60 percent of sales from outside the United States, said sales fell 3.2 percent to $7.58 billion, below the $7.84 billion expected by analysts.  Excluding currency effects, 3M said its sales rose 3.3 percent, which trailed some analysts’ projections. JPMorgan analyst Steve Tusa called results “weaker than expected” while saying in a research note that the company was “managing well” through the currency issues and “a tough global environment.” The company now expects currency swings to reduce sales by 6 percent to 7 percent, against a previously expected decline of 4 percent to 5 percent.  It cut its 2015 profit view to a range of $7.80 to $8.10 per share, compared to its prior range of $8 to $8.30. The projection is 2.5 percent lower, when comparing the mid-points of each range. Excluding currency effects, 3M backed its previous expectation that sales will rise between 3 percent and 6 percent this year. “The stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales and earnings in the first quarter, and global economic growth was mixed,” 3M Chief Executive Officer Inge Thulin said in a statement. First-quarter net income slipped to $1.2 billion from $1.21 billion a year ago. Earnings per share rose to $1.85 per share from $1.79 per share a year ago, as the company reduced its shares outstanding. Currency hurt quarterly earnings by 10 cents a share, 3M said.

189,MMM,"3M's new technology chief has a bigger budget, bigger goal","ST. PAUL, Minn. (Reuters) - At a time when many companies are investing a smaller portion of revenues in research and development, 3M Co has given Chief Technology Officer Ashish Khandpur more to spend, and he is aiming at bigger targets. Khandpur, a 20-year 3M veteran and chemical engineer who holds patents related to pressure-sensitive adhesives, is helping oversee a push to expand R&D; spending to about 6 percent of revenue by 2017 from about 5.5 percent in 2012. That equates to about $160 million in additional spending annually.  In an interview with Reuters, Khandpur said the fresh money will be used to develop “disruptive platforms”, which can yield products that are sold into multiple markets and can change the competitive landscape. “Each of these platforms we have funded is a several hundred million dollar opportunity at maturity,” he said at 3M’s St. Paul headquarters campus. It was his first interview since assuming his post in July. So far, 3M, which posted $31.8 billion in revenue last year, says it has 30 such programs in various stages of development, with $250 million in sales expected this year from those already commercialized.  Khandpur pointed to Crystal Silk, a new surface material that is smooth to the touch, yet also designed to be scratch- and stain-resistant. It is used for computer touchpads, a new market for 3M, and also could have applications in appliances and other areas. 3M is bucking the trend with its plans to crank up R&D; spending. Consulting firm Strategy& says annual R&D; spending as a percentage of revenue among the world’s 1,000 largest R&D; spenders fell from 4.2 percent in 2005 to 3.5 percent in 2014. R&D; spending did rise in absolute terms over that time. Already, 3M invests more than double the average 2.3 percent spent last year by 190 industrial companies tracked by Strategy&. Of other large industrial companies, United Technologies reported spending 4.1 percent of revenue on R&D; in 2014, while General Electric’s research budget amounted to 4.8 percent of its industrial revenue. For GE, that budget compares to 5.3 percent in 2013, and 5.1 percent in 2012. “Businesses, just because they are under pressure quarter-to-quarter of delivering their numbers, can get operational at times,” said Khandpur, 47. “We want to make sure that as a company we don’t fall into that trap and we are able to fund big programs.” Analysts are watching 3M’s R&D; spending to see if the company can deliver products with higher pricing and margins. “If R&D; productivity is poor, that’s a huge disappointment,” Edward Jones analyst Matt Arnold said. “Not only does it imply your pace of growth could slow, but it’s also going to be a drag because it’s significant money spent.” Khandpur says 3M is taking steps to improve its chances of delivering significant new products, such as sharpening the individual focus of its 85 labs in 37 countries. The technology chief leads a monthly meeting of nine executives that recommends which major research programs the manufacturer should pursue, and which it should drop. 3M is also expanding efforts to get outside ideas. The company has roughly 50 technical centers globally that are designed to expose customers to 3M’s technology. In March, 3M unveiled plans for a new center in western China. One avenue Khandpur is exploring is creating products with digital capabilities. He is hiring people with experience in electronics, software and mathematics to augment the company’s traditional strengths in materials sciences. Among the projects underway are work on developing sensors that can be embedded in cable splices to monitor power lines, and Khandpur envisions respirators that can track the wearer’s vital signs or detect if the device is being worn incorrectly. “It’s not about creating a software company in Minnesota,” Khandpur said. “Our thinking is our core products are intersecting with the digital world.” ",6012015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-3m-research/3ms-new-technology-chief-has-a-bigger-budget-bigger-goal-idUSKBN0OH3BV20150601
190,MMM,3M strikes biggest-ever deal for KKR's Capital Safety,,6232015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-capital-safety-m-a-3m/3m-strikes-biggest-ever-deal-for-kkrs-capital-safety-idUSKBN0P31N520150623
191,MMM,UPDATE 4-3M strikes biggest-ever deal for KKR's Capital Safety,"(Adds Breakingviews link) By Lewis Krauskopf June 23 (Reuters) - 3M Co on Tuesday struck a deal to boost its presence in worker protection gear by buying Capital Safety from private equity firm KKR & Co for $1.8 billion, the U.S. diversified manufacturer’s largest-ever purchase. The transaction moves 3M Chief Executive Officer Inge Thulin closer to 3M’s five-year goal of $5 billion to $10 billion in acquisitions through 2017. It also comes as other industrial companies, such as Honeywell International Inc and United Technologies Corp, are scouring for deals. “We have been looking for 3M to step up its acquisition activity,” Edward Jones analyst Matt Arnold said. “The company has done a lot in the past few years to really get its house in shape in terms of margins, and now it’s time to deploy its capital to grow.” Capital Safety sells harnesses, lanyards and other gear for workers in construction, mining and other industrial sectors. It stands to expand 3M’s personal safety business, which includes respirators, protective eyewear and safety apparel. 3M, which also makes Post-it notes and Scotch tape along with a variety of adhesives, films and abrasives, pointed to rapidly growing demand for protective gear fueled by increasing worker-safety regulations globally. The personal protective equipment market is more than $25 billion globally, and growing by 3 percent to 4 percent a year, according to 3M. The market for fall-protection gear that involves Capital Safety’s products is $1.6 billion, but rising by 5 percent or more. St. Paul, Minnesota-based 3M put the Capital Safety deal’s value at $2.5 billion, including about $700 million in net debt. Headquartered in nearby Bloomington with about 1,500 employees, Capital Safety recorded $430 million in sales in its latest fiscal year and has increased revenue by 10 percent a year on average over the past four years, according to 3M. That growth rate made the deal more palatable to some analysts, who deemed the purchase price expensive at 14 times annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Morningstar analyst Barbara Noverini said the deal was a good strategic fit, in part because of 3M’s potential to use its technologies to improve Capital Safety’s products, such as by adding reflective webbing to a safety harness. Under KKR, Capital Safety expanded internationally, with new manufacturing and training facilities in China. It quadrupled its business in Brazil and grew its business revenue in the Middle East and Africa by more than 80 percent. “Inge Thulin and I have been talking for a while, we had dinner in New York, we agreed to do it fast, and that was it,” Pete Stavros, the head of KKR’s industrials investment team, told Reuters. “It shows you he has a strategic mindset, he decided to fill out 3M’s line in safety products with a global leader.” KKR stands to make three times its $615 million equity investment in Capital Safety, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information. 3M expects the deal to close in the third quarter and for it to add 12 cents to earnings per share in the first year, when excluding purchase accounting adjustments and one-time costs. Analysts on average expect 2015 earnings of $7.93 per share on $31.1 billion in sales for 3M, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Until now, 3M’s biggest deal was the roughly $1.35 billion purchase of filtration company Cuno 10 years ago, a company spokeswoman said. Morgan Stanley advised 3M, while Goldman Sachs  advised KKR.

199,MMM,3M exploring sale or spinoff of health software unit,"(Reuters) - U.S. diversified manufacturer 3M Co (MMM.N) said on Thursday it was exploring a sale or spinoff of its healthcare data and software business. The decision comes as Chief Executive Officer Inge Thulin reviews 3M’s broad business portfolio, which includes Post-it notes as well as adhesives, abrasives and other products for a variety of industries. At the same time, the company has struck acquisition deals to expand in other areas. The healthcare technology business has become more competitive as companies and the U.S. government raise spending as regulatory requirements increase.  Xerox Corp (XRX.N) said in July that it would exit some government health information systems businesses, including managing state Medicaid systems, and focus on higher-margin healthcare areas.  Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp (CTSH.O) earlier this year purchased U.S. healthcare IT services provider TriZetto Corp for $2.7 billion, pushing its second-quarter healthcare revenue up 39 percent. 3M Health Information Systems, a unit of the company’s healthcare business, had trailing 12-month revenue of about $730 million, according to 3M.  The health information systems business provides healthcare data aggregation, analysis and strategic services. It counts  more than 5,000 hospitals as among its customers along with government clients.     St. Paul, Minnesota-based 3M said it hired Goldman Sachs (GS.N) to advise on strategic alternatives for the health information unit. It said it expected a decision by the end of the first quarter of 2016 and could choose to retain and invest in the business. 3M in June struck a deal to boost its presence in worker protection gear by buying Capital Safety from private equity firm KKR & Co (KKR.N) for $1.8 billion, its largest purchase ever. 3M shares were down 0.3 percent at $140.50 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Scott Safety makes respiratory and protective equipment and other safety products for firefighters, industrial workers, police squads and the U.S. military.

Johnson Controls, which manufactures products ranging from car batteries to heating equipment, had been exploring a sale of the business, Reuters had reported last week. Proceeds from the deal are expected to be about $1.8 billion-$1.9 billion, and would be used to repay a portion of Tyco International Plc’s $4.0 billion of merger-related debt, Johnson Controls said. Johnson Controls agreed to buy Ireland-based peer Tyco International in January last year and the merger completed in September. 3M’s financial advisers were Citi and Goldman Sachs while Centerview Partners provided financial advice to Johnson Controls.

Scott Safety makes respiratory and protective equipment and other safety products for firefighters, industrial workers, police squads and the U.S. military.

Proceeds from the deal are expected to be about $1.8 billion-$1.9 billion, and would be used to repay a portion of Tyco International Plc’s $4.0 billion of merger-related debt, Johnson Controls said. Johnson Controls agreed to buy Ireland-based peer Tyco International in January last year and the merger completed in September. 3M’s financial advisers were Citi and Goldman Sachs while Centerview Partners provided financial advice to Johnson Controls.

260,MMM,UPDATE 1-Apple to create $1 billion U.S. advanced manufacturing fund,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) plans to create a $1 billion fund to invest in U.S. companies that perform advanced manufacturing, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said on Wednesday, the iPhone maker’s latest effort to show how it is creating U.S. jobs. The Cupertino, California company will announce the fund’s first investment later in May, Cook said during an interview on CNBC. Cook also said Apple plans to fund programs that could include teaching people how to write computer code to create apps, and will release more details about the effort this summer. The announcements were the latest in a series of disclosures to highlight how Apple, the world’s largest company by market valuation, contributes to job creation in the United States. Apple came under fire from President Donald Trump during his campaign because it makes most of its products in China.  In February during the company’s annual shareholder meeting, Cook said Apple spent $50 billion in 2016 with its U.S. suppliers, which include firms like 3M Co (MMM.N) and Corning Inc (GLW.N), the first time Apple has disclosed the metric. Cook reiterated that point during the CNBC interview, along with Apple’s claim that it has created 2 million jobs in the United States, 80,000 of which are directly at Apple and the rest coming from suppliers and software developers for the company’s app ecosystem. Apple is highlighting its U.S. presence at the same time lawmakers consider a major tax proposal by Trump that would let Apple, along with other large companies, bring back accumulated profits from overseas at potentially lower tax rates. Ninety-three percent of Apple’s $256.8 billion cash is held overseas. Cook, who met with lawmakers in Washington earlier this year to discuss tax policy and technology issues, said that Apple would have to borrow the cash for its U.S. manufacturing investment fund and said he was hopeful Trump administration would address the repatriation issue. Cook stopped short of saying Apple would bring some of its cash back into the United States if Trump’s tax proposal was enacted. “To invest in the United States, we have to borrow. This doesn’t make sense on a broad basis. So I think the administration, you saw they’re really getting this and want to bring this (cash) back. And I hope that comes to pass,” Cook said in response to a question about tax reform.

The settlement provided the fund some potential recovery depending on Panda Temple’s performance, and the deal was folded into the company’s restructuring support agreement.

302,MMM,"3M, Minnesota settle water pollution claims for $850 million","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Industrial group 3M Co and Minnesota’s attorney general have agreed to settle a lawsuit over polluted groundwater, with the company agreeing to grant $850 million to the state for groundwater projects, the attorney’s office said on Tuesday. Attorney General Lori Swanson had been seeking at least $5 billion in damages from 3M to help clean up the company’s disposal of industrial chemicals in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area over the past 40 years. The Minnesota-based company said in a statement the grant would enable projects that “support water sustainability” and “improve groundwater recharge” in the Twin Cities. It gave no details of what the projects involved. Swanson had filed the lawsuit in 2010, alleging 3M had dumped millions of pounds of excess toxic chemicals in areas east of St. Paul beginning in the 1950s, causing higher rates of cancer, premature births and lower fertility. The company, based in Maplewood, Minnesota, denied the state’s claims, saying the chemicals posed no health risk at their current levels of exposure and that it had not found any adverse health effects among its employees, who are exposed at higher levels than the general population. The settlement came on the day a jury trial was scheduled to start in the case. Swanson said in a statement she appreciated 3M’s willingness to resolve the matter. The chemicals at issue, called perfluorinated compounds, or PFCs, were made in a 3M plant south-east of St. Paul and used in 3M’s Scotchgard brand products. 3M said it would record a 2018 first-quarter charge of approximately $1.10 to $1.15 per share including legal fees as a result of the settlement. Shares in the company were down 0.6 percent at $235 in extended trading at 2200 GMT.   Swanson said the settlement grant only covered damages to natural resources, adding that her office had no jurisdiction to recover damages for personal injuries. According to 3M’s latest financial filing in January, the company still faces at least 24 similar groundwater pollution lawsuits filed in courts across the U.S. Some of those complaints include personal injury and property damage claims. An older generation of PFC compounds, known as PFOA or C-8, commonly used to manufacture non-stick products such as Teflon, has been linked to six illnesses, including testicular cancer, ulcerative colitis and thyroid disease. DuPont and its spin-off Chemours settled some 3,550 personal injury claims arising from C-8 pollution for $671 million last year.
