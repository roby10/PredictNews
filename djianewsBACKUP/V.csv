1,V,EBay buys Zong as mobile payments gain traction,"NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - EBay Inc said on Thursday it agreed to buy cellphone payments provider Zong for about $240 million in cash to help its PayPal unit push further into mobile commerce.  EBay does not expect the deal to affect its financial outlook. It should close in the third quarter of 2011.  Zong is eBay’s seventh acquisition so far in 2011. Other deals this year include the purchase of GSI Commerce, Magento and Where. The company is buying businesses and technology that can help it work with more merchants as commerce moves increasingly online.  The strategy has been welcomed so far by investors. EBay shares rose 1.4 percent at $33.38 on Thursday afternoon, leaving them up more than 17 percent so far this year.  Zong is a leader in mobile payments for virtual and digital goods, offering one of the main ways to load up on social-networking currency Facebook Credits and quickly purchase items while playing social games like Zynga’s FarmVille.  Zong lets shoppers pay through their mobile phone account. When checking out online, a customer enters his or her number in a box. Zong verifies it and sends a text, to which the customer replies. The payment shows up on the wireless bill at the end of the month.  Zong has access to 3.2 billion mobile users through relationships with more than 250 wireless carriers in 45 countries.  For PayPal, the deal will let its 100 million users fund their accounts with their phones — something the company didn’t offer before.  The move comes as PayPal tries to defend its business against inroads by Visa, MasterCard, Google Inc and big U.S. banks, which are developing ways for customers to pay online or with phones as well as cards.  The total value of mobile payments may reach $670 billion by 2015, from $240 billion this year, according to a recent Juniper Research forecast.  “Online and offline payment worlds are blurring with the growth of mobile and smart phones,” said Dana Stalder, general partner of venture capital firm Matrix Partners, which invested in Zong.  “It’s increasingly important for anyone in the payment industry to have mobile phone numbers authenticated and attached to their wallet offerings,” added Stalder, a former PayPal employee who helped start projects including PayPal Mobile.  With Zong, PayPal gets 30 million authenticated phone numbers already attached to payment accounts, he noted.  In a typical online checkout, shoppers see four options: Visa, MasterCard, American Express and PayPal. The fifth option is paying with a mobile phone number, Stalder added.  “PayPal will effectively be the payment operator behind two of the five main payment options in online checkout flows,” he said.  Zong will also give PayPal another way to make sure its nine million merchants get sales completed online quickly and smoothly.  Wireless carriers have low limits on transaction sizes and volume currently. If a Zong mobile purchase hits such caps, it will be easy to shift that transaction to another source of cash in the PayPal system, Stalder explained.  “What the merchant cares about is completed transactions,” he said. “This is a way of offering more funds-in capabilities and higher converting checkout flow for merchants.”  Ultimately, Stalder sees an opportunity for a company to create a “wallet in the cloud” that is funded by all sources of money and can be used to pay for anything online and offline.  In May, Google, MasterCard, Citigroup, Sprint and transaction processing company First Data unveiled a new service that lets shoppers pay for things with mobile phones.  A day after the announcement, PayPal sued Google for allegedly stealing trade secrets related to mobile payment systems.  On Thursday, PayPal Chief Financial Officer Patrick Dupuis said the Zong purchase wasn’t a reaction to rivals’ efforts to build mobile wallet businesses.  “There’s been a lot of chit chat on this. We don’t think mobile wallet. We just think wallet. We’re there. We’ve been in digital for six years,” Dupuis told Reuters. “I think it’s the other guys who are trying to compete with us.”  ",7072011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ebay/ebay-buys-zong-as-mobile-payments-gain-traction-idUSTRE7663E420110707

The man is suspected of being part of the Internet activist group “Anonymous” that attacked websites it considered hostile to WikiLeaks after it posted confidential U.S. diplomatic cables on its website last year. 	   Online payments service PayPal and credit card giants Visa and MasterCard were among Anonymous’ targets.	   Snider said the Swiss authorities intervened at the demand of their Italian counterparts, as all the alleged offenses had been committed in Italy.	   “The man is an Italian citizen but he was born in Ticino and has lived here all his life,” he said.	   Police in Italy said they have identified a group of hackers who have carried out several cyber attacks on Italian institutions and companies since January.	   Italy’s anti-cyber crime police CNAIPIC have identified three people, including a minor. So far they have made 32 raids in Italy, as well as the Lugano raid conducted in coordination with Swiss authorities, Italian police said in a statement.	   “The damage caused to institutions and companies hit by an attack is extensive; they are no longer able to provide services to users while the return to normal functioning of the web site often takes several hours, coming with a considerable cost,” police said.

3,V,Exclusive: WikiLeaks loses Icelandic financial lifeline,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has lost a financial lifeline. Since December, bans by the world’s major credit card networks, it has been difficult for supporters of the controversial whistleblower to send him donations. But this week, WikiLeaks gained a brief respite with the unwitting help of an Icelandic bank.  The window was quickly closed.  On Thursday, WikiLeaks payments provider DataCell said it could start processing donations to Assange’s group again, circumventing a months-long ban by Visa and MasterCard.  An Icelandic bank called Valitor had agreed to accept payments processed by DataCell, but DataCell did not tell Valitor that those payments would include donations to WikiLeaks, the bank told Reuters on Friday.  “Valitor was not informed that DataCell would be conducting these activities when their business agreement was made,” spokeswoman Jonina Ingvadottir told Reuters in an emailed statement on Friday.  She cited Visa and MasterCard’s prohibition on the “service such as DataCell is offering WikiLeaks.”  The world’s two largest credit card processing networks were among several companies to cut off services to WikiLeaks late last year after the whistleblower organization made public a massive trove of secret U.S. diplomatic cables.  One person familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier on Friday that Valitor had blocked the Visa and MasterCard WikiLeaks donations and terminated its contract with DataCell.  Fewer than 100 donations were processed before Valitor blocked the payments, the person said.  Other media outlets this week reported that it was Visa Europe that discontinued the WikiLeaks donations, but DataCell told Reuters that Valitor discontinued all donations to WikiLeaks it had been accepting.  The failed Valitor partnership is the latest blow to Assange, who has struggled to gain funding since the major payments networks stopped processing payments to WikiLeaks.  The Internet vigilante group Anonymous temporarily shut down the public websites of both Visa and MasterCard in December after the companies began their embargo.  Visa and MasterCard send money from bank to bank around the world, on behalf of consumers, companies, governments and other organizations. But those organizations, including WikiLeaks and its processing partner, need bank partners.  DataCell founder Olaf Sigurvinsson confirmed that Valitor had terminated the contract with his company this week. He told Reuters that when he signed the contract with Valitor, “it was absolutely clear that we were going to continue our proposal to collect donations,” including to WikiLeaks.  He said DataCell has filed a complaint over Valitor’s actions to the financial supervisor in Iceland, and that it plans to file one to the European Union.  Visa Europe spokeswoman Amanda Kamin said in an email on Friday that “an acquirer briefly accepted payments on a merchant site linked to WikiLeaks.” She said as soon as this came to Visa’s attention, action was taken. Kamin did not elaborate further.  MasterCard said it has not changed its position on the WikiLeaks donation embargo.

4,V,"WikiLeaks partner loses Visa, MasterCard loophole","   * DataCell found new bank to accept WikiLeaks donations   * Bank shut down donations within hours   * Visa, MasterCard embargo on WikiLeaks continues   By Maria Aspan   NEW YORK, July 8 (Reuters) - A WikiLeaks partner found a new bank to accept Visa (V.N) and MasterCard (MA.N) donations this week, but the respite from the card networks’ months-long embargo was only temporary, because the bank shut down the payments within hours, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.   Visa and MasterCard, the world’s two largest card networks, blocked donations to WikiLeaks in December. But on Thursday, WikiLeaks payments provider DataCell said it could start processing donations to Julian Assange’s group again.

5,V,EU wants to track cash in terrorism probes," * EU wants to track cash of terrorism suspects        * Data privacy cloud U.S. anti-terror efforts in Europe        By Francesco Guarascio        BRUSSELS, July 12 (Reuters) - Credit card companies such as Mastercard and Visa may be forced to share transaction data with European Union authorities under plans to investigate terrorism financing in Europe, due to be presented on Wednesday.        The EU’s executive Commission is set to unveil plans for a mechanism to collect and monitor financial information linked to terrorism suspects that would mirror similar efforts in the United States, EU officials said.        Like their U.S. counterparts, EU investigators would rely largely on data about bank transfers, collected by companies such as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT).        But EU officials say the scope of the programme could be extended to other sources of information about cash used by people suspected of terrorist activities, such as credit-card or money transfer companies.        “Other providers can also include credit companies,” one Commission official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.        Policymakers have pushed for the creation of a European system to track suspect cash and complement efforts in the United States because of concerns over data privacy when data is shared with investigators outside Europe.        Such worries had dogged talks between the EU and the United States over sharing bank transfer data provided by SWIFT last year and had led the European Parliament to veto a deal, before Washington agreed to more privacy safeguards.        As part of a deal giving Washington access to SWIFT data, U.S. policymakers agreed last year to help the EU create its own programme to track suspect cash.        U.S. investigators have tracked cash linked to terrorism suspects since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.   They say the data collected has helped investigations into numerous attacks in Europe, such as the 2004 bombings in Madrid and those in London in 2005.        But the amount of data transferred has been a cause of concern for EU lawmakers who say passing data about EU citizens in bulk violates their rights.        Setting up a European programme would alleviate some concerns, but the process is likely to take years. EU governments, and the parliament, will have decide exactly how data should be collected and used.        In a document to be presented on Wednesday, and seen by Reuters, the European Commission will suggest several options for creating the mechanism, with varying level of involvement by EU governments.

7,V,WikiLeaks files complaint over Visa and Mastercard,"LONDON (Reuters) - WikiLeaks and the Icelandic IT company DataCell filed a formal complaint to the European Commission on Thursday, saying payment companies Visa Europe and MasterCard Inc violated EU antitrust laws by blocking donations.  Visa Europe, which runs the largest card network in the European Union, and MasterCard blocked WikiLeaks from using its network to collect funds from donors in December 2010.  The complaint, filed to the Directorate-General for Competition of the European Commission, says Visa and MasterCard breached antitrust provisions set out by Articles 101 and 102 of the EU Treaty.  DataCell, which has an agreement to collect credit card donations on behalf of WikiLeaks, says the credit card giants engaged in anti-competitive behavior and abused their dominant market position.  WikiLeaks, led by Australian Julian Assange, urged the EU Commission to order both credit card companies to lift their ban with “immediate effect.”  Visa and MasterCard stopped processing donations for WikiLeaks after the United States criticized the organization’s release of sensitive diplomatic cables.  Visa said last December that it was investigating whether the nature of WikiLeaks’ business contravened its operating rules.  Cyber hackers supporting WikiLeaks retaliated by attacking the Visa and Mastercard websites.  WikiLeaks has come under increased international scrutiny after releasing a slew of diplomatic cables that have embarrassed Washington.

10,V,UPDATE 2-US arrests 14 for roles in PayPal cyber attack," * 14 arrested for Wikileaks revenge cyber attack on PayPal   * AT&T contractor also arrested for leaking sensitive docs  (Adds details about arrests in U.S. and Europe)   By Jeremy Pelofsky and Diane Bartz   WASHINGTON, July 19 (Reuters) - U.S. authorities on Tuesday arrested 16 people on charges they participated in major cyber attacks, including the crippling of eBay’s (EBAY.O) PayPal website as retribution for dropping WikiLeaks as a client.   FBI agents arrested 14 people in nine states and Washington, D.C., for the PayPal attack, which occurred last December and was allegedly coordinated by the hacking group Anonymous. It was the biggest response by authorities tied to a recent spate of high-profile cyber attacks.   Financial institutions like PayPal, Visa (V.N) and MasterCard (MA.N) withdrew services from WikiLeaks last year after the website published thousands of sometimes embarrassing secret U.S. diplomatic reports that have caused strains between Washington and numerous allies.   Hackers responded with so-called distributed denial-of-service attacks that flooded the companies’ websites with requests for information and rendered them unavailable to legitimate users, according to the indictment filed in federal court in San Jose, California.   PayPal suffered attacks for several days last December. Company spokesman Anuj Nayar said he could not comment on current legal action.   The 14 individuals were charged with conspiracy, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison if convicted, and intentional damage to a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.   The accused ranged in ages from 20 to 42 and lived in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, the District of Columbia, Florida, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Mexico and Ohio.   One of the difficulties authorities have had tracking down hacking attacks is that they can be launched from anywhere and can come from an individual who can mask his location.   Law enforcement authorities believe Anonymous is mostly made up of hackers believed to be in their teens and early 20s. The group has taken credit for numerous attacks, including against Bank of America, Sony and the Malaysian government.   “The fact that they have been tracked back and that some of them have been arrested is a significant development,” said Mark Rasch, a former chief of the Justice Department’s cyber crimes unit and now director of Cybersecurity and Privacy Consulting for the government technology services firm CSC.   In a likely sign investigations are intensifying, U.S. authorities executed more than 35 search warrants around the country in their investigation of coordinated cyber attacks against major companies and organizations, the Justice Department said.   The Justice Department and FBI have been under pressure to crack down on hackers who have stepped up their attacks on corporate and government websites in the past several months in a bid to thwart their activities.   Stewart Baker, a former top official of the Homeland Security Department, said the FBI probably gave the case extra attention because of the public taunting the bureau received from Anonymous and related groups.   “It does look like some of these guys (hackers) were just fools. The PayPal attack in particular,” said Baker, now at the law firm Steptoe and Johnson LLP. “It looks like these bozos must have just said ‘Cool, an attack on PayPal. You can use my machine.’   “I think it makes it a lot less likely that that people will join the next digital lynch mob,” he said.   Another related arrest came in New Mexico where an employee for a contractor for AT&T’s wireless service faced charges of accessing a computer without authorization by allegedly downloading thousands of documents related to its 4G data network and LTE mobile broadband network.   The data was subsequently downloaded to a file-sharing web site in April and another one of the loosely organized groups of hackers, Lulz Security, subsequently publicized the data breach, the complaint said. AT&T had no comment on the arrest.   The other man arrested by FBI agents was in Florida where he was charged with illegally accessing Tampa Bay Infragard’s website and uploading three malicious files. The group is an FBI-sponsored organization focused on critical infrastructure.   The Justice Department said British police arrested one person and Dutch authorities arrested four for cyber crimes related to recent attacks on major companies and organizations.

The arrests came after claims by the group it broke into Apple Inc (AAPL.O) servers and launched attacks last year that shut down sites of MasterCard Inc (MA.N) and Visa Inc (V.N).   Arrests were made in California, Florida and New Jersey, a second law enforcement source said.   Neither source wanted to be identified as charges had not been unsealed.   The arrests followed raids on six locations in New York, including one in Brooklyn and five others on Long Island. They were searched for computers and computer-related accessories, the FBI said.   The equipment was suspected of being used by members of the grass-roots organization inspired by WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange.   No arrests were made in New York.   FBI officials in California and Florida said searches were underway but declined to confirm any arrests.   A spokesman for the FBI in New Jersey said one arrest was made there but declined to say where or on what charges.   Court papers for the sweep were expected to be unsealed later on Tuesday.   Anonymous, which law enforcement authorities believe is mostly made up of hackers believed to be in their teens and early 20s, also has released scores of private e-mails and other data from an Arizona police website.   The group teamed up with the Lulz Security group of hackers in June. LulzSec has breached websites of Sony Corp, the CIA and a British police unit.   Experts say the FBI raids should have been expected as the group’s actions have become more daring.   “I don’t think anybody should be surprised,” said Josh Shaul, chief technical officer of Application Security, Inc., which helps companies protect their data. “They played with fire and they got burned.”  ",7192011,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fbi-hacking/update-2-fbi-arrests-14-in-probe-of-hacker-group-anonymous-idUSN1E76I11C20110719
12,V,UPDATE 2-Isis hooks up with four payment networks," * Isis in deals with Visa, MasterCard, Discover, Amex   * Still expects to offer service in 2012   * Sees 2012 launch with “handful” of banks   (Adds Isis comment, background)   By Sinead Carew   NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) -  Isis, a venture of three of the top four U.S. mobile providers, plans to launch mobile payments services with major payment networks Visa (V.N), MasterCard (MA.N), Discover (DFS.N) and American Express (AXP.N), the venture said on Tuesday.   The venture of Verizon Wireless, AT&T Inc (T.N), and T-Mobile USA hopes to convince consumers to start using their mobile phones to pay for goods instead of plastic credit cards or cash.   Isis, which plans to kick off its service in the first half of 2012, will compete with Google Inc (GOOG.O) and No. 3 U.S. mobile service Sprint Nextel (S.N), which plan to launch services this summer.   Now that it has signed up the four payment networks, Isis expects to be able to more easily finalize deals with banks that issue credit cards, Ryan Hughes, Isis Chief Marketing Officer, told Reuters.   “It delivers a message to the banking community,” said Hughes, who noted that banks needed to know that their payment network partners would work with Isis before signing up as partners for the service.   Which payment networks are involved in the service launch depends on whether Isis has been able to sign up the network’s bank partners, said Hughes, who expects to have a “handful” of banks ready for its launch next year.   Participating banks need to invest in new technology to support a mobile payments and several have already done so, according to Hughes, who would not name bank partners.   Isis expects to make money from the service by generating revenue from their financial services partners and by offering merchants the option to link loyalty programs or coupon offerings to the Isis service, the executive said.   For example, instead of printing out a coupon found on a merchant’s website, consumers would be able to click on an Isis button to have the coupon delivered to their cellphone. Then the coupon could be applied automatically during a mobile transaction in that merchant’s store.   Hughes said merchants will be able to access an application interface to link their offerings with Isis.   While the company is still working on pricing for mobile payments, Hughes said he expects Isis to “take a small percentage of the cost of delivering” an ad or coupon to the Isis application.   In countries such as the United States, where most people have bank accounts and credit cards, analysts see easy-to-use electronic coupons and loyalty programs as the main way for wireless companies to convince consumers to pay with their cellphones instead of their credit cards.

14,V,FBI raid seeks suspected 'Anonymous' computers," NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - The FBI on Tuesday raided three homes in New York for computers suspected of being used by members of the Internet vigilante hacking group Anonymous, an agency spokesman said.   One residence in Brooklyn and two others on Long Island were searched for computers and computer-related accessories. At least one laptop was removed from one of the homes, the FBI said.   No one was arrested.   “The searches are in connection to an ongoing investigation,” FBI spokesman Peter Donald said.   Anonymous, a grass-roots organization inspired by WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange, claimed to have broken into Apple Inc (AAPL.O) servers earlier this month.   It also launched attacks in December that temporarily shut down sites of MasterCard Inc (MA.N) and Visa Inc (V.N) using simple software tools freely available over the Internet.   Anonymous also has released scores of private e-mails and other data from an Arizona police website.   The group teamed up with the Lulz Security group of hackers in June. LulzSec has breached websites of Sony Corp (6758.T), the CIA and a British police unit.

15,V,"EBay's PayPal going offline, targets big retailers","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - EBay Inc’s PayPal business has become one of the largest online payment systems, but its now heading offline, Chief Executive John Donahoe said in the wake of the e-commerce company’s quarterly results on Wednesday.  “We intend to help retailers grow their businesses offline in the same way we helped merchants grow online,” Donahoe said during a conference call with analysts.  PayPal will be testing “point-of-sale innovation” with a major U.S. retailer by the end of this year, he added.  During 2012, PayPal will roll out in-store payment services with up to 20 national retailers, Donahoe predicted, without identifying the companies.  EBay reported second-quarter results late Wednesday that were dented by acquisition costs, and the e-commerce company forecast third-quarter profit just below analyst forecasts, sending shares 1 percent lower to $32.58.  PayPal reported $1.073 billion in second-quarter net revenue, up 31 percent from a year earlier. That’s the first time PayPal has generated more than $1 billion in quarterly revenue.  PayPal’s growth has been driven by online payments. But Donahoe said on Wednesday that the boom in smartphone usage is blurring the lines between online and offline commerce.  “We’ve had merchants reach out to us quite aggressively, and saying they want us to bring PayPal into the Point of Sale,” he added. “We see it as an incremental opportunity, and a fairly significant incremental opportunity that will play out over the next three to five years.”  Ken Sena, an analyst at Evercore Partners, said investors want eBay to pursue the offline payments opportunity more aggressively.  One way may be to partner with daily deal companies including Groupon and LivingSocial, Sena said. Donahoe said eBay would consider such partnerships.  EBay has stressed that it’s agnostic about what mobile payment standards emerge as the dominant technologies, arguing PayPal will work with all platforms.  Near-Field Communication, or NFC, is one emerging technology that may let shoppers buy with their mobile phones.  Evercore’s Sena said eBay hasn’t described a strategy to help create the main standard. The concern is that once the standard is established, PayPal may not be the main way to pay.  “That’s dead wrong,” Donahoe told Reuters on Wednesday. “Merchants will make the decision.”  The only standard that will be accepted by big merchants will be one that accepts all payment systems, including those run by MasterCard, Visa and PayPal, he explained.  With roughly 100 million “wallets in the cloud” PayPal is too big to be excluded, Donahoe added.  EBay said second-quarter net income was $283.4 million, or 22 cents per share — down from $412 million, or 31 cents a share, a year earlier. The decline in earnings was mainly driven by costs from eBay’s acquisition of GSI Commerce earlier this year.  “They are incorporating a new division and there are always costs associated with a large acquisition like this,” said Bill Smead of Smead Capital Management, which owns eBay shares.  Smead also noted that eBay shares have peaked several times around $34.50 during the past 3-1/2 years.  “It might take a little more good news to get it through there,” he said. “I’m not surprised to see a little selling as it approaches this level.”  Excluding acquisition costs, stock-based compensation expenses and other items, profit was $630.9 million, or 48 cents per share, versus $530 million, or 40 cents per share, a year earlier.  On that basis, both the profit and the revenue beat expectations.  Analysts on average expected EBay to make 46 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Revenue in the latest period was $2.8 billion, up 25 percent from the second quarter of 2010. Second-quarter revenue was expected to be $2.607 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  EBay said it expects third-quarter earnings per share to be 46 cents to 47 cents a share. Analysts were forecasting third-quarter profit of 47 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  EBay will increase marketing spending in the second half of 2011, after keeping such investments flat in recent years, Donahoe told analysts during Wednesday’s conference call.  EBay will run television ads late in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter to try to lure more customers back to the company’s online marketplace and attract new buyers, he noted.  “I’ve said for now a couple of years that we’re holding off increasing marketing and focusing on our current customers until we get our user experience to the place where we feel it’s ready,” Donahoe said. “And we feel like we’ve passed that point now.”  Gross merchandise value, or GMV, excluding vehicle sales — a closely watched measure of activity on eBay’s Marketplace — rose 17 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, to $14.7 billion, eBay reported.

17,V,U.S. arrests 14 for roles in PayPal cyber attack,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. authorities on Tuesday arrested 16 people on charges they participated in major cyber attacks, including an attempt to cripple eBay’s PayPal website as retribution for dropping WikiLeaks as a client.  FBI agents arrested 14 people in nine states and Washington, D.C., for the PayPal attack, which occurred last December and was allegedly coordinated by the hacking group Anonymous. It was the biggest response by authorities tied to a recent spate of high-profile cyber attacks.  Financial institutions like PayPal, Visa and MasterCard withdrew services from WikiLeaks last year after the website published thousands of sometimes embarrassing secret U.S. diplomatic reports that have caused strains between Washington and numerous allies.  Hackers responded with so-called distributed denial-of-service attacks that flooded the companies’ websites with requests for information and rendered them unavailable to legitimate users, according to the indictment filed in federal court in San Jose, California.  PayPal suffered attacks for several days last December. Company spokesman Anuj Nayar said he could not comment on current legal action.  The 14 individuals were charged with conspiracy, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison if convicted, and intentional damage to a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.  The accused ranged in age from 20 to 42 and lived in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, the District of Columbia, Florida, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Mexico and Ohio.  One of the difficulties authorities have had tracking down hacking attacks is that they can be launched from anywhere and can come from an individual who can mask his location.  Law enforcement authorities believe Anonymous is mostly made up of hackers believed to be in their teens and early 20s. The group has taken credit for numerous attacks, including attacks on Bank of America, Sony and the Malaysian government.  “The fact that they have been tracked back and that some of them have been arrested is a significant development,” said Mark Rasch, a former chief of the Justice Department’s cyber crimes unit and now director of Cybersecurity and Privacy Consulting for the government technology services firm CSC.  In a likely sign investigations are intensifying, U.S. authorities executed more than 35 search warrants around the country in their investigation of coordinated cyber attacks against major companies and organizations, the Justice Department said.  The Justice Department and FBI have been under pressure to crack down on hackers who have stepped up their attacks on corporate and government websites in the past several months in a bid to thwart their activities.  Stewart Baker, a former top official of the Homeland Security Department, said the FBI probably gave the case extra attention because of the public taunting the bureau received from Anonymous and related groups.  “It does look like some of these guys (hackers) were just fools. The PayPal attack in particular,” said Baker, now at the law firm Steptoe and Johnson LLP. “It looks like these bozos must have just said ‘Cool, an attack on PayPal. You can use my machine.’  “I think it makes it a lot less likely that that people will join the next digital lynch mob,” he said.  Another related arrest came in New Mexico where an employee for a contractor for AT&T’s wireless service faced charges of accessing a computer without authorization by allegedly downloading thousands of documents related to its 4G data network and LTE mobile broadband network.  The data was subsequently downloaded to a file-sharing web site in April and another one of the loosely organized groups of hackers, Lulz Security, subsequently publicized the data breach, the complaint said. AT&T had no comment on the arrest.  The other man arrested by FBI agents was in Florida, where he was charged with illegally accessing Tampa Bay Infragard’s website and uploading three malicious files. The group is an FBI-sponsored organization focused on critical infrastructure.

19,V,U.S. cyber arrests seen leading to more hackers," * FBI seized computers and other records during arrests   * Likelihood of prison time has not sunk in, official says   By Jeremy Pelofsky   WASHINGTON, July 21 (Reuters) - The FBI’s arrest this week of 16 people who allegedly participated in high-profile cyber attacks is providing a treasure trove of information and will lead to further arrests, a U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters on Thursday.   The crackdown — on members of the group Anonymous — was the biggest reaction so far by U.S. authorities to a string of cyber attacks, and was meant to serve as a deterrent to others who may be considering joining the cause.   The arrests spanned nine states and the District of Columbia. FBI agents also executed more than 35 search warrants, seizing computers and other records. Those arrested could try to strike plea agreements offering to provide information to win more lenient treatment. [ID:nN1E76I23K]   Some private cybersecurity specialists have questioned whether the raids will have much lasting impact.   But the law enforcement official said, “This is the good example of a significant event that successfully removed a number of individuals from being part of the problem and will certainly lead to information that will result in locating other subjects.” The official declined to be further identified while speaking about an ongoing law enforcement investigation.   Members of Anonymous mounted attacks last year against eBay’s (EBAY.O) PayPal as well as Visa (V.N) and Mastercard (MA.N) after the companies severed their relationships with the WikiLeaks organization. The attacks included flooding the sites with data trying to render them inoperable.   The arrests included members of Anonymous at various levels of the loose-knit organization, the official said. The official declined to comment on whether they knew each other.   While attacks by Anonymous and related “hacktivist” groups have drawn wide attention, other cyber crimes aimed at espionage are a higher priority for the FBI. The latter have included intrusions at Google (GOOG.O), Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) and the International Monetary Fund.   “We didn’t pull resources away from those higher priority cases to work this,” the official said.   It remains an open question whether the arrests will have the desired deterrent effect. Anonymous and another hacking group, Lulz Security, issued a statement on Thursday saying they would continue their efforts.   “I think they (the FBI) are trying to send a signal that this isn’t cost-free in the hopes that it will scare off some of the others. If we’re lucky it will work,” said James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.   The law enforcement official said that people allegedly involved in the cyber attacks probably did not realize the risks of prison time and that prosecutors would likely seek stiff sentences. Those arrested, if convicted, could face up to 10 years in prison for trying to damage a protected computer.   “They’re probably not the types of people who have been prepared for any time in jail. This is not a joke,” the official said. “The reality of the fact that this is both a crime and that people will be actually doing time in jail I think really hasn’t sunk in to a lot of people who are getting involved in these activities.”   Lewis said one possible benefit from the cyber attacks is that it will lead network and website administrators to beef up their security.   “These guys exploit poor configuration, and that’s the simplest thing to fix but there’s just so much of it out there it will take a while,” Lewis said.

21,V,Visa rolls out new fee program,"CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - Visa Inc’s quarterly profit rose by 40 percent, and the world’s largest payment processor said it would introduce a new fee structure for U.S. merchants.  Visa Chief Executive Joseph Saunders, in a conference call with analysts, said the payment processor would introduce a network participation fee in the United States for all of its debit, credit and prepaid card services.  As part of the new policy, Visa also will lower the variable rate charged for transactions.  Visa’s shift away from per-transaction fees is a large departure for the San Francisco-based company, which is being done to comply with new fee caps imposed by the Dodd-Frank financial reform law passed last year.  Saunders did not disclose what the participation fee will be, but said it will be based on a merchant’s size, and the merchants’ number of locations.  Due to the overhaul and the new fee caps imposed by Dodd-Frank, Saunders said 2012 will be a “low point” for debit card processing fees.  “We won’t do as well as we have,” he said.  The new program comes as Visa reported better-than-expected fiscal third quarter results, and plans to buy back an additional $1 billion in shares over the next year.  For Visa, the quarterly results highlight consumers’ increasing reliance on debit and credit cards rather than cash or checks to make everyday purchases.  “They’re getting better results as consumers are shifting from paper to plastic,” said Shannon Stemm, a financial services analyst with Edward Jones.  Analysts said the company’s continued profits drove the new share buyback program, following a similar $1 billion share buyback announced in April and completed in the fiscal third quarter.  Visa on Wednesday reported fiscal third-quarter net income of $1 billion, or $1.43 per Class A common share, up from $716 million, or 97 cents per share, a year ago.  Excluding the one-time, noncash gain on its Visa Europe put option, Visa earned $883 million, or $1.26 per share.  Analysts estimated Visa would report net income of $1.23 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Total operating revenue increased 14 percent to $2.3 billion from a year ago.  Total payment volumes increased 17 percent to $941 billion from $802 billion.  Visa’s international business is becoming a larger portion of its quarterly results. Payments outside the U.S. — $422 billion — accounted for 44 percent of Visa’s third quarter volume, up from 41 percent a year ago, when such payments totaled $333 billion.

Visa Chief Executive Joseph Saunders, in a conference call with analysts, said the payment processor would introduce a network participation fee in the United States for all of its debit, credit and prepaid card services.   As part of the new policy, Visa also will lower the variable rate charged for transactions.   Visa’s shift away from per-transaction fees is a large departure for the San Francisco-based company, which is being done to comply with new fee caps imposed by the Dodd-Frank financial reform law passed last year.   Saunders did not disclose what the participation fee will be, but said it will be based on a merchant’s size, and the merchants’ number of locations.   Due to the overhaul and the new fee caps imposed by Dodd-Frank, Saunders said 2012 will be a “low point” for debit card processing fees.   “We won’t do as well as we have,” he said.   The new program comes as Visa reported better-than-expected fiscal third quarter results, and plans to buy back an additional $1 billion in shares over the next year.   For Visa, the quarterly results highlight consumers’ increasing reliance on debit and credit cards rather than cash or checks to make everyday purchases.   “They’re getting better results as consumers are shifting from paper to plastic,” said Shannon Stemm, a financial services analyst with Edward Jones.   Analysts said the company’s continued profits drove the new share buyback program, following a similar $1 billion share buyback announced in April and completed in the fiscal third quarter.   Visa on Wednesday reported fiscal third-quarter net income of $1 billion, or $1.43 per Class A common share, up from $716 million, or 97 cents per share, a year ago.   Excluding the one-time, noncash gain on its Visa Europe put option, Visa earned $883 million, or $1.26 per share.   Analysts estimated Visa would report net income of $1.23 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   Total operating revenue increased 14 percent to $2.3 billion from a year ago.   Total payment volumes increased 17 percent to $941 billion from $802 billion.   Visa’s international business is becoming a larger portion of its quarterly results. Payments outside the U.S. — $422 billion — accounted for 44 percent of Visa’s third quarter volume, up from 41 percent a year ago, when such payments totaled $333 billion.

23,V,UK police say arrested teen hacking leader,"LONDON (Reuters) - British police arrested a teenager believed to be a leader of computer hacking groups that boasted attacks on the networks of the CIA, Sony and Rupert Murdoch’s media empire.  The arrest of the 19-year-old man, who UK police said goes by the hacker nickname “Topiary,” may be the most significant to date in a global effort to end a cyber-crime spree by the hacker activist groups Lulz Security and Anonymous.  Topiary is believed to have controlled the main Twitter account of Lulz Security, which the group used to publish data obtained by hacking into corporate and government networks. The messages were written in an irreverent style, filled with sarcasm, expletives and inside jokes that were sometimes difficult to decipher.  The arrest was part of a “pre-planned, intelligence-led operation,” the police service said.  “The arrest of ‘Topiary’ is important as it sends a strong message to other hackers or would-be hackers,” said Chet Wisniewski, a security researcher with UK anti-virus software maker Sophos.  “While many have found the antics of Lulz Security entertaining, breaking into computers and stealing the personal details of innocent people is a serious crime,” he said.  British police said the suspect was being held at a house in the remote Shetland Islands, off Scotland’s northeast coast, though they planned to take him to a police station in central London.  LulzSec has claimed responsibility for cyber-attacks on the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, multiple Sony Corp websites and the website of Murdoch’s British newspaper group, News International.  The group has attracted widespread global media coverage for its stunts and has nearly 350,000 followers on Twitter, the messaging website.  Last month, British police charged Ryan Cleary, 19, with attacking the website of Britain’s Serious Organized Crime Agency (SOCA) and sites owned by the British Phonographic Industry and the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.  Cleary, arrested as part of a joint investigation by London police and the U.S. FBI into recent attacks on high-profile websites, was given bail.  The FBI raided six locations in New York earlier this month and conducted searches in California as part of an investigation into the hacking group Anonymous.  The groups issued a statement on Wednesday, saying that the FBI had wrongfully arrested some of their supporters for participating in “digital sit-ins.” Those campaigns had temporarily shut down the websites of targeted groups by overwhelming them with Internet traffic.  “Anonymous ‘suspects’ may face a fine of up to $500,000, with the addition of 15 years’ jail time, all for taking part in a historical activist movement,” the statement said.  The statement also urged supporters to boycott eBay Inc’s PayPal electronic payment service. It asked supporters to close their PayPal accounts.  The hacker activists have previously attacked PayPal to show their opposition to the service’s refusal to process payments to WikiLeaks, the website founded by Julian Assange that published copies of secret U.S. government diplomatic cables.  A spokesman for PayPal said the company had observed no changes in normal operations, including the number of accounts that had been closed overnight.  Anonymous also claimed to have broken into Apple Inc servers in July. It also launched attacks in December that temporarily shut down sites of MasterCard Inc and Visa Inc using simple software available on the Internet.

28,V,MasterCard profit jumps 33 percent,"CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - MasterCard Inc said second-quarter profit jumped 33 percent, as inflation in the United States lifted spending volume and more international consumers used debit and credit cards.  Shares rose as much as 10.9 percent.  The credit- and debit-card processor said signing up two big banks — SunTrust Banks Inc and Banco Santander SA U.S. affiliate Sovereign Bank — to offer MasterCard debit cards helped boost revenue in the second quarter, and should help next quarter too. The two banks had previously offered Visa Inc debit cards.  MasterCard executives told analysts on a conference call that the company benefited from overseas customers using debit and credit cards instead of cash to make payments, a long-term trend.  Spending over the MasterCard payments network also increased because of rising prices in the United States for gasoline and other goods, even though the broader economy has stayed sluggish.  U.S. economic weakness is now translating to slowing inflation or even deflation, which could cut into the dollar size of transactions that MasterCard processes in the coming quarters. But analysts said the company’s expanding international business can offset any domestic slowdown.  “They’re getting strength from other areas,” said Shannon Stemm, a financial services analyst with Edward Jones.  Purchase, New York-based MasterCard on Wednesday reported second-quarter net income of $608 million or $4.76 per share, up from $458 million, or $3.49 per share, a year earlier.  Analysts had expected $4.23 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Visa also beat analysts’ expectations when it reported quarterly results last week.  MasterCard executives said they would alter their U.S. debit interchange fee structure in advance of new industry fee caps being imposed on those charges later this year.  The fees are charged to merchants for processing customers’ debit card transactions. The so-called Durbin amendment to the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law placed a cap on those fees which takes effect later this year.  MasterCard’s U.S. market chief Chris McWilton said the company would institute a two-tiered fee structure by October 1, with fees varying according to the size of the merchant. McWilton did not comment on how the new system relates to the Durbin amendment, or how it would affect revenue.  Last week, Visa said it would introduce a flat network participation fee, and lowered the per-transaction rate for processing all U.S. transactions.  MasterCard’s U.S. payment volumes were boosted by a spike in food and energy prices that fanned inflation earlier in the year, undercutting consumer spending and economic growth. But with gasoline prices off their peak of $4.02 a gallon in early May, inflation pressures are subsiding.  Consumer prices fell 0.2 percent in June, the largest drop in a year. Economists expect prices to moderate further in the months ahead amid sluggish demand.  MasterCard’s revenue increased 22 percent to $1.7 billion as its cross-border and overseas business grew.  Overall, MasterCard’s cross-border transactions rose 19.3 percent, and processed transactions increased 17.4 percent.  The company said it also gained from new processing business in the Netherlands and Brazil.  Total operating expenses increased 20 percent to $782 million. MasterCard said the rise was due to higher personnel costs related to acquisitions.  MasterCard shares were up 10.1 percent at $328.75 on Wednesday afternoon, off a new year-high hit earlier of $331.12.

30,V,Visa to speed up migration to mobile wallet,"BANGALORE (Reuters) - Visa Inc said it would accelerate the move to chip technology and speed up the use of mobile payments in the United States, as the world’s largest payment processor tries to corner a share in the nascent smartphone payments market.  High-end smartphones are now shipping with “near-field communication” (NFC) technology that allows shoppers to make payments with little more than a wave of their phone.  NFC technology passes encrypted information between devices at close range without contact. Instead of swiping a card, shoppers can wave their smartphone near a terminal, effectively turning an NFC-enabled phone into a “mobile wallet.”  “As NFC mobile payments and other chip-based emerging technologies are poised to take off in the coming years, we are taking steps today to create a commercial framework that will support growth opportunities,” Jim McCarthy, Visa’s global head of product, said in a statement.  With a new method of payments poised to take off, technology giants like Google and mobile service providers such as Sprint Nextel are also jostling for a share of the pie.

Visa said it would continue to support a range of cardholder verification methods, including signature and PIN methods.

32,V,Foreign brands widen London super-prime retail map," * Space shortage, high rents form barriers to entry on Bond Street   * Demand sees key money soar for West End fringes   * Store locations on Bond Street periphery in focus    By Brenda Goh	   LONDON, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Top-tier global retailers are driving an expansion of London’s swanky West End shopping district ahead of the 2012 Olympic Games, leading to fierce and expensive rivalry for stores on the fringes of Bond, Regent and Oxford Streets.	   “There’s a gradual expansion of what I would call those super-prime locations for luxury retailers,” said Grosvenor’s director of London estate, Giles Clarke, whose folio includes  chunks of retail hotspots Mount Street and Motcomb Street.   	   Locations experiencing a surge in demand from foreign high-end retailers include Bruton Street, where French fashion brand Isabel Marant paid key money of 750,000 pounds ($1.2 million), and Marylebone High Street, where Parisian retailer Sandro set up shop after paying key money of more than 700,000 pounds. 	   Key money is the sum a retailer pays to an existing tenant for the agreement to move out so they can take over the store.	   “Retailers are paying significant premiums to get into the right locations ... (and) one of the consequences of that is that some of the retailers are being squeezed slightly into more traditionally peripheral streets,” Clarke said.	   Many retailers see the July 2012 Olympic Games as a trading boon, driving heavy footfall in London, whose glitzy retail areas have made it one of the world’s fashion capitals  ,  alongside New York, Paris and Milan.  	   Credit card company Visa estimated tourism would add 750 million pounds to consumer spending during the seven-week period encompassing the Olympic and Paralympic Games.	   U.S. homeware brands Williams-Sonoma and Crate & Barrel are among those eyeing shop openings in London, after retailers such as Liz Claiborne Inc.’s Kate Spade, Limited Brands Inc’s Victoria’s Secret, Polo Ralph Lauren Corp.’s Rugby have taken stores in the last 12 months.	   European companies looking for store space include Swedish underwear company Bjoern Borg and UK brand Burberry . 	   “Two years ago you got premiums (on Mount Street and Marylebone High Street) but you might have gotten 100,000 pounds, 200,000 pounds in key money for a lease,” Cushman & Wakefield’s head of London retail  ,    Peter Mace, told Reuters. 	   “What you’re seeing is that levels of key money which used to be reserve for the likes of Bond Street, Sloane Street, are now being paid for what are viewed as upper secondary locations,” Mace said.	 	   Analysts spoken to by Reuters named South Audley Street, Dover Street, Carlos Place, parts of Davies Street and Brompton Road among areas that could see rents and key money pushing higher on the back of growing interest from luxury retailers.  	   Zone A rents for Davies Street and Carlos Place were about 150-200 pounds a square foot, and could rise to more than 300 pounds by end-2013, said Clarke, who manages parts of  both streets. 	   Capital & Counties said rents at its Covent Garden retail hotspot “offered considerable scope for growth over the coming years.” Average Zone A rent there was about 390 pounds sq ft, against a comparable basket of high-quality central London retail locations of 640 pounds sq ft. 	   Mace said Cushman & Wakefield was speaking to at least 50 international retail brands looking to open stores in London, more than half of which were eyeing their first shop openings in the UK capital. 	   Such a search for new retail locations follows record rents and premiums paid on Bond Street and Oxford Street, the latter of which saw U.S. apparel chain Forever 21 pay HMV   about 14 million pounds’ key money for access to a 35,000 sq ft store.	   “It’s the result of very strong demand and little supply,” Savills retail director Anthony Selwyn said, citing robust foreign demand for the space-starved neighbourhood.  	   “Remember that we’re not the only agents ...

33,V,Google and Visa team up on mobile payments,"(Reuters) - Google Inc has enlisted Visa Inc in its effort to push mobile payments, striking an agreement to allow Visa account-holders to pay for store purchases with their smartphones.  Visa comes onboard a “Google Wallet” project already supported by Citigroup, MasterCard, Sprint Nextel Corp and First Data. In May, the group announced a trial of a system that lets shoppers store money on phones and pay at checkout.  Rival Isis, a venture between Verizon Wireless, AT&T Inc and T-Mobile USA, has already signed partnerships with all the major card networks, including MasterCard and Visa.  But while Sprint announced the launch of the Google Wallet service on Monday, Isis has said its rival service will not launch until early next year.  Google’s system competes with plans by other top U.S. banks and mobile phone companies and employs near-field communication (NFC) technology, used widely in Asia.  On Monday, Google and Visa said the Internet search leader had received a worldwide license to Visa’s “paywave” — similar to Mastercard’s PayPass — enabling its installation on Android smartphones. Customers link their credit or debit bank accounts to Android phones with the Google Wallet app installed.  They can then tap their phones — which come with an NFC chip — at specially installed terminals at checkout to effect a purchase.  “This agreement extends Google Wallet to Visa account holders worldwide,” said Stephanie Tilenius, Google’s vice president of Commerce and Payments.  “This is a crucial step toward realizing our shared vision for the future of mobile commerce.”  For U.S. banks, mobile payments are a way to wean their customers off the use of cash and generate more revenue. Merchants pay banks a fee every time a shopper buys something with a credit or debit card and Google said it would not take a cut of those fees from the new pay-by-phone system.

36,V,"Heartland Payment sees growth in market share, margins","(Reuters) - Payment processor Heartland Payment Systems Inc HPY.N sees scope for growing its market share and margins at a time when the sluggish U.S. economy is expected to hurt its larger rivals.  The company, which competes with JPMorgan Chase’s (JPM.N) Chase Paymentech, KKR’s (KKR.N) First Data and Global Payments (GPN.N), caters mainly to small and mid-size merchants, who are doing better even as larger retail chains struggle with a cutback in consumer spending.  “Our business model allows us to make money at pricing levels that we think are challenging to some of our competitors,” said Heartland’s President Robert Baldwin in an interview with Reuters.  “We win some, they win some ... but we think we can take market share from them. Even modest moves in market share are very meaningful to us,” added Baldwin, whose responsibilities cover Heartland’s operations, administrative activities and internal controls.  While the weak U.S. market has forced payment processors to look abroad for growth opportunities and possible acquisitions, Baldwin said Heartland, which has operations in the United States and Canada, has no immediate plans of entering newer markets.  “There’s a ton of opportunity in the United States, and we want to focus on establishing a better share here.”  Heartland’s stock has grown 36 percent over the past one year, outperforming the broader S&P 1500 Data Processing & Outsources Services Sub-Industry Index .15GSPTKDP, which has risen 18 percent in the same period.  Stanford alumnus Baldwin, who served as Heartland’s chief financial officer for over a decade from 2000 to 2011, also said he sees the company’s margins growing over the next few quarters.  “We know we’ll achieve some more savings in the processing and servicing line because of the processing center consolidations that we still have under way, and the remainder is likely to come from our restraint in the G&A line item,” he said.  On a post-earnings call in August, the company said it hoped to complete its transition from 12 centers to 3 centers by mid-2012.  Heartland, which is expected to pass on benefits from lower debit interchange rules to its merchants, should also see better merchant retention in 2011 compared with last year, Baldwin said.  “Merchant retention has been trending better modestly over the last year, basically driven by the fact that we have fewer businesses going out of business,” he added.  On the proposed debit interchange rules, Baldwin said the company would see a lower cost from the reduced interchange, which it would pass on to its merchants, but it was too early to predict the exact outcome and benefits for the company.  Heartland Payment, which was the target of a massive cyber hacking attack in 2008, said issues from the data breach were largely behind them.  The data theft resulted in several lawsuits, including some from major card companies like Visa (V.N), MasterCard (MA.N), American Express (AXP.N) and Discover Financial (DFS.N).  “It’s absolutely way (behind) in our rearview mirror and we feel very good about the future,” Baldwin said.  “There are some things that could reemerge in the future but right now they’re very very quiet.”  ",9212011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-heartlandpayment/heartland-payment-sees-growth-in-market-share-margins-idUSTRE78K65R20110921
37,V,Discover Financial beats profit estimates,"(Reuters) - Discover Financial Services (DFS.N) reported higher quarterly profit, topping analysts’ estimates, on increased credit card spending by customers and lower costs for bad loans.  Net income rose to $649 million in the third quarter that ended August 31, from $261 million a year earlier, the Riverwoods, Illinois-based credit card company said on Thursday.  Earnings per share were $1.18, beating analysts’ average estimate of 96 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Discover stock slipped nine cents to close at $25.25 on a day when many financial stocks were down sharply.  “We achieved record results again this quarter as a result of further improvements in credit performance and record sales volume,” Chairman and Chief Executive David Nelms said in the announcement.  The delinquency rate for credit card loans over 30 days past due fell to a new low for the company of 2.43 percent, down from 2.79 percent in the second quarter and 4.39 percent a year earlier.  With the improvement in delinquencies, the company’s expenses for loan losses fell to $100 million, down 86 percent from $713 million a year earlier.  Discover reduced its reserve for credit losses by $359 million in the latest quarter, compared with $187 million a year earlier.  But the boosts from reserve releases are going to fade, executives cautioned after the announcement.  “We believe we have reached the end of the really large reserve releases like the one we had this quarter and the last few quarters,” Nelms said in an interview.  Nelms said that delinquency rates are unlikely to fall much further from their current record lows and that the company will have to make new provisions for losses as its makes new loans.  As a result, Discover will probably start building its loss reserves again in 2012, Chief Financial Officer Mark Graf said on a conference call with analysts.  The shift could be a bad, but inevitable, sign for future earnings reports from banks in general. Bank profits have been lifted for several quarters by reserve releases, which essentially reversed what proved to be excess expenses recorded for bad loans during the recession.  Nelms told Reuters the timing for the end of releases at other lenders will likely vary because of their different mixes of loans. Discover lends mostly on credit cards.  The trailing off of the accounting lift will put more pressure on financial firms to increase their businesses profitably, which is what Discover did in the third quarter. Sales on its credit cards increased 9 percent from a year earlier to $26.3 billion and were up from $24.8 billion in the second quarter.  The company said card volume rose because increased spending by new and existing customers and higher gas prices.  Interest yield on card accounts slipped 0.4 percentage points from a year earlier to 12.46 percent because of new restrictions from federal CARD Act, an increase in promotional rates and the fact that more customers are paying their balances in full.  Graf said the company’s profits from interest will benefit from a “tailwind” of lower funding costs in 2012 as it replaces deposits taken two or three years ago with new deposits at lower current rates.  Discover said it bought back 8.4 million of its shares, or 1.5 percent, in the third quarter for $198 million.  Through Wednesday, the company’s shares were up more than 36 percent this year.

39,V,"Fund view: Tech, healthcare best bets: Edgewood","(Reuters) - ‘You are better equipped to drive growth in bad times if you offer appealing products and have new ones in the pipeline’ is Edgewood Growth Fund’s mantra and the technology and healthcare sectors provide such havens.  Portfolio manager Alan Breed’s top picks are Apple, Qualcomm Inc and American Tower Corp — all majors in the technology space, although the fund invests in large-cap growth companies regardless of sector or industry.  “We are finding most of the growth in the (technology) sector in a few companies that are taking advantage of the growth in wireless communication. And for that they happen to be our biggest overweight at the moment,” Breed told Reuters in an interview.  Breed also likes healthcare companies Intuitive Surgical Inc, Celgene Corp, Allergan Inc.  “Many hospitals that are under pressure (to cut costs) and want to increase their utilization of their operating rooms, have begun to purchase (Intuitive’s) Da Vinci systems to do prostatectomy and hysterectomy,” he said.  Celgene and Allergan are attractive picks as they are developing new products that would help grow sales, Breed said.  Meanwhile, growing demand for American products in China will drive sales at some consumer companies like Yum Brands and Coach Inc, said Breed, who has been with Edgewood for 27 years.  Breed also likes growth stocks like Expeditors International Of Washington Inc, Visa Inc, National Oilwell Varco Inc and Southwestern Energy Co.  “Once the macro environment gets a little more clear, you should begin to see multiple advances on growth companies, which today are not being given the kind of valuations that they deserve,” he said.  However, the fund does not own any holdings in banks as their “yield curve is quite flat” and the government has reduced the amount of debt they are allowed to take on, Breed said.  “Now that the banks are highly regulated, I think it is going to be very difficult for them to make above-average rates of return,” the fund manager said.  The Edgewood Growth Fund is down slightly year-to-date, outperforming the benchmark Russell 1000 Growth Index that has lost 3.21 percent. The New York-based fund had $1.3 billion in assets at the end of June.  “If you believe in the United States of America and the ingenuity of the American management, then this is an excellent time to put money to work.” (Reporting by Divya Sharma and Vidya L Nathan in Bangalore; Editing by Viraj Nair)",9232011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-edgewoodgrowthfund/fund-view-tech-healthcare-best-bets-edgewood-idUSTRE78M5EM20110923
40,V,"Insight: China's e-payment booms, foreigners get the boot","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Use your fingerprint to buy a bowl of noodles for half off at 10 yuan ($1.60).  It was a proposition attractive enough to send Su Weiting out of the Shanghai noodle shop where she was getting lunch and around the corner to sign up for an account with yet another payment service provider, Live By Touch.  “When I used to buy something that costs over a thousand yuan, I would have to take a wallet bursting of cash,” said Su as she finally settled down with her noodles. “Using a bank card made things much easier. Now I don’t even need that. I can leave home without anything and bring things home.”  As consumption booms, especially through the Internet, China’s electronic payment service industry has taken off. With credit and debit cards, prepaid cards, mobile payments, online payments, and now biometric payments, dozens of companies are vying for a part of the fast growing pie.  It’s a cut-throat industry where deep discounts, presents, and points are luring new clients. Live By Touch, a small player so far operating only in Shanghai, links clients’ fingerprints with their bank accounts — call it the new Midas touch.  Last year, transactions through online payment companies, the PayPals of China, passed 1 trillion yuan ($156 billion) for the first time. And by 2013, it’s expected to triple, according to research firm Analysys International.  Cards, which make up the bulk of e-payments, swiped 10.4 trillion yuan last year in retail sales, making up about 35 percent of retail spending, according to the central bank. That in a country a decade ago was mostly a cashed based society.  The numbers can make overseas investors salivate, but it looks, once again, like they could be left in the cold.  While the e-payment service industry outside of debit and credit cards had largely been unregulated, the central bank last year implemented a rule that requires third party payment service providers to get a license.  And it said companies backed by foreign money needed special approval from the State Council, which has been interpreted by some local media as a move to kick out foreign investors.  “It’s difficult to say what the government’s policy is going to be in terms of enforcement, because they haven’t really had any chances to enforce things yet,” said Dave Carini, managing director of China Maverick Research.  It’s been a sensitive topic and several companies with foreign shareholders have declined to talk.  The rule has also caused a public spat between China’s e-commerce giant Alibaba Group and its shareholders SoftBank Corp and Yahoo! Inc.  Alibaba cited the rule as a reason for transferring China’s biggest online payment company Alipay, which has nearly half of the market, to a company wholly owned by its chairman Jack Ma. Yahoo and Softbank together have a fully diluted stake of about 69 percent of Alibaba Group.  In the end, the companies agreed that Alibaba Group would receive between $2 billion and $6 billion if Alipay is sold or listed, which some analysts said short-changed Yahoo! and Softbank.  “No one would have anticipated that 15 years ago that China would be the world’s largest internet market, one of the world’s largest e-commerce markets and have 750 million, 800 million people with cell phones,” said Gary Rieschel, managing director of Qiming Venture Partners. “So a lot of the rules are reactive as opposed to prescriptive.”  On some level, it shouldn’t be a surprise that the door is now closing on foreign investors in the e-payment industry.  China, like other countries, has long sought to preserve domestic dominance in key sectors, and the financial industry has been one of them. In the credit card segment, the likes of Visa Inc and MasterCard have long been barred from entering the domestic yuan card market despite China’s pledge to the WTO to open the payment service market by the end of 2006.  Earlier this year, the U.S. Trade Representative’s office requested the World Trade Organization establish a dispute settlement panel in its e-payment case against China to pry open China UnionPay’s monopoly on the domestic card market.  “I’m very hopeful China will eventually open up,” said Ling Hai, MasterCard’s Greater China division president. “I can’t comment on the timing but I think that’s definitely the direction it is going.”  Former U.S. Congressman and former WTO judge James Bacchus, said he believes the United States will win the case, and that China will have to implement the rulings or face possible economic sanctions.  “I think (the plaintiff countries) would be likely to act on this threat of economic sanctions if China did not comply because of the stakes in this particular case,” said Bacchus.  “It is certainly not in the interest of the United States or China’s other trading partners to allow China to allow China UnionPay to develop its own monopoly perch here in China and then use that to secure market access overseas.”  The WTO case against China comes as UnionPay steps up its efforts to chip away at Visa and MasterCard’s global market.  The Chinese card mammoth is already in over 110 countries and claims to be the third most used card in terms of transaction amount. And footloose Chinese travelers, most of them carrying a UnionPay card, are speeding things up.  UnionPay, majority owned by China’s Big Four lenders, had more than 1.4 billion debit cards in circulation last year and was valued at around $11.3 billion in July.  “Last year their transaction volume overseas increased about 47 percent, so they’re making a lot of headway internationally,” said Ben Cavender, associate principal of retail consulting firm China Market Research Group.  “If you look at Harrods in the UK, they installed UnionPay pay points. First quarter of this year they’ve already seen sales to Chinese consumers go up 40 percent.”  The UnionPay logo is also finding its way into the wallets of some unsuspecting non-Chinese. One Irish national living in Hong Kong found her bank card, which allowed her to access cash back in ATMs in Ireland before, stopped working last summer. She flipped the newly issued card and found the Plus logo replaced with the tricolor logo of UnionPay which can’t yet be used in Ireland.

The announcement on Wednesday by the venture capital heavyweight signals a heightened interest in the space that Sequoia partner Alfred Lin said is “highly fragmented” and lacks a dominant player.  “We want to be an investor in the most interesting companies of tomorrow and we felt like this would be a company for the ages,” said Lin, who will take a seat on Achievers’ board of directors.  Sequoia has had a long history in backing technology companies such as Apple (AAPL.O) and Google (GOOG.O).  The round also included previous investors in Boston-based GrandBanks Capital and Toronto, Canada-based firms JLA Ventures and the Ontario Venture Capital Fund.  Achievers has now raised $38 million since CEO Razor Suleman founded the company in 2002 in Toronto. Formerly named I Love Rewards, the company, which has 150 employees, has since expanded to Boston and San Francisco and Suleman said the latest funding will be put toward hiring in all three markets and extensive marketing of the product.  Suleman said the employee rewards and recognition industry has shifted away from the traditional model of giving workers gifts in the form of watches at the end of an extended period of service.  Now he said it’s about employers tapping into the more “intrinsic” motivations and ambitions of employees through regular performance and engagement metrics and rewarding them accordingly.  One way it does this is through its “social recognition” platform that tracks and rewards employees with points that can be redeemed for gifts from companies like Apple (AAPL.O), Visa (V.N) and Expedia (EXPE.O).  Achievers’ customers range from firms with 500 employees up to Fortune 500 companies such as Deloitte DLTE.UL, 3M (MMM.N) and Microsoft (MSFT.O).

That in a country a decade ago was mostly a cashed based society.	   The numbers can make overseas investors salivate, but it looks, once again, like they could be left in the cold. 	   While the e-payment service industry outside of debit and credit cards had largely been unregulated, the central bank last year implemented a rule that requires third party payment service providers to get a license. 	   And it said companies backed by foreign money needed special approval from the State Council, which has been interpreted by some local media as a move to kick out foreign investors. 	   “It’s difficult to say what the government’s policy is going to be in terms of enforcement, because they haven’t really had any chances to enforce things yet,” said Dave Carini, managing director of China Maverick Research.	   It’s been a sensitive topic and several companies with foreign shareholders have declined to talk. 	   The rule has also caused a public spat between China’s e-commerce giant Alibaba Group and its shareholders SoftBank Corp and Yahoo! Inc . 	   Alibaba cited the rule as a reason for transferring China’s biggest online payment company Alipay, which has nearly half of the market, to a company wholly owned by its chairman Jack Ma. Yahoo and Softbank together have a fully diluted stake of about 69 percent of Alibaba Group. 	   In the end, the companies agreed that Alibaba Group would receive between $2 billion and $6 billion if Alipay is sold or listed, which some analysts said short-changed Yahoo! and Softbank.	   “No one would have anticipated that 15 years ago that China would be the world’s largest internet market, one of the world’s largest e-commerce markets and have 750 million, 800 million people with cell phones,” said Gary Rieschel, managing director of Qiming Venture Partners. “So a lot of the rules are reactive as opposed to prescriptive.”	   On some level, it shouldn’t be a surprise that the door is now closing on foreign investors in the e-payment industry. 	   China, like other countries, has long sought to preseve domestic dominance in key sectors, and the financial industry has been one of them. In the credit card segment, the likes of Visa Inc and MasterCard have long been barred from entering the domestic yuan card market despite China’s pledge to the WTO to open the payment service market by the end of 2006. 	   Earlier this year, the U.S. Trade Representative’s office requested the World Trade Organization establish a dispute settlement panel in its e-payment case against China to pry open China UnionPay’s monopoly on the domestic card market.	   “I’m very hopeful China will eventually open up,” said Ling Hai, MasterCard’s Greater China division president. “I can’t comment on the timing but I think that’s definitely the direction it is going.”	   Former U.S. Congressman and former WTO judge James Bacchus, said he believes the United States will win the case, and that China will have to implement the rulings or face possible economic sanctions. 	   “I think (the plaintiff countries) would be likely to act on this threat of economic sanctions if China did not comply because of the stakes in this particular case,” said Bacchus. 	   “It is certainly not in the interest of the United States or China’s other trading partners to allow China to allow China UnionPay to develop its own monopoly perch here in China and then use that to secure market access overseas.”	   The WTO case against China comes as UnionPay steps up its efforts to chip away at Visa and MasterCard’s global market. 	   The Chinese card mammoth is already in over 110 countries and claims to be the third most used card in terms of transaction amount. And footloose Chinese travelers, most of them carrying a UnionPay card, are speeding things up.	   UnionPay, majority owned by China’s Big Four lenders, had more than 1.4 billion debit cards in circulation last year and was valued at around $11.3 billion in July. 	   “Last year their transaction volume overseas increased about 47 percent, so they’re making a lot of headway internationally,” said Ben Cavender, associate principal of retail consulting firm China Market Research Group.	   “If you look at Harrods in the UK, they installed UnionPay pay points. First quarter of this year they’ve already seen sales to Chinese consumers go up 40 percent.”	   The UnionPay logo is also finding its way into the wallets of some unsuspecting non-Chinese. One Irish national living in Hong Kong found her bank card, which allowed her to access cash back in ATMs in Ireland before, stopped working last summer. She flipped the newly issued card and found the Plus logo replaced with the tricolor logo of UnionPay which can’t yet be used in Ireland.

44,V,Analysis: U.S. consumers get swiped in debit fee crackdown,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A government crackdown on debit card “swipe fees” is unlikely to benefit consumers’ wallets, as banks seek makeup fees and retailers take the savings down to their own bottom line.  For months, retailers, card network companies and big banks brawled in Washington over the fees and even launched nationwide advertising campaigns. Consumers were often portrayed by retailers as the ones victimized by the billions of dollars in debit card processing fees that banks charge merchants.  On the eve of the mandated lower fees, it appears the skeptics who feared the measure would backfire on consumers were correct.  Bank of America said on Thursday it plans to charge customers who use their debit cards to make purchases a $5 monthly fee.  Representative Barney Frank, co-author of last year’s Dodd-Frank financial oversight law, said he opposed including the crackdown in the legislation.  He said in an interview with Reuters on Friday that shoppers are unlikely to benefit.  “I regard this as mostly a dispute between two groups of businesses, banks and retailers, and the consumer gets squeezed,” Frank said. “The banks will charge you more, and I don’t think the retailers are going to charge you less, which is why I didn’t want to put it in the first place.”  Some retailers are not shy about plans to pocket the savings.  Dave Ratner, founder of Dave’s Soda & Pet City chain in Massachusetts, said he will save thousands of dollars annually on swipe fees. Nearly 2 percent of his revenue currently goes to banks for debit and credit card swipe fees.  “This is just a huge relief and is getting back what is mine anyway,” said Ratner, who noted that merchants have been powerless to negotiate processing fees with banks until now.  “My customers would laugh at me if I said, ‘We are going to give you a dime off if you use a debit card.’”  Senator Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, led the charge to include the swipe fee limits in Dodd-Frank. He has maintained that the legislation will decrease prices for consumers and help small merchants struggling to meet processing fees that amount to about 400 percent of the processing cost.  Dodd-Frank called on the Federal Reserve to craft the limits, which set the stage for a massive lobbying campaign. Banks and card network companies tried to get the cap set as high as possible, while retailers pressed for a low cap.  The Fed capped “interchange fees” at an average of 24 cents per debit card purchase. The current average fee is 44 cents on a typical debit card purchase of $38.  That translates into a $6.6 billion annual hit to financial firms, according to an August study by Javelin Strategy and Research.  Javelin also noted that seven of the top 10 banks had announced plans to eliminate free checking and the so-called Durbin amendment has banks rethinking their customer services.  The writing was on the wall for consumers. A November 2009 report from the Government Accountability Office found that limiting swipe fees would be good for retailers but not necessarily for consumers.  The independent congressional watchdog found that it would be difficult to tell whether retailers were passing along any savings to consumers, and that consumers may face higher card use costs as banks made up for lost income.  “If you are a consumer, and you are caught in the middle of this, you are going to end up having to pay more as a result of this sloppy legislation for a debit card,” said Trish Wexler, a spokeswoman for the Electronic Payments Coalition, which represents card networks Visa, MasterCard, and several large banks.  Retail trade groups are steadfast that the windfall for them will not necessarily be a loss for customers.  Mallory Duncan, senior vice president of the National Retail Federation, said merchants will likely pass on savings because their industry is so competitive.  “The average net profit margin in the retail industry is approximately 2 percent,” said Duncan. “This reduction (in swipe fees) is another tool they can use to compete for customers.”  Dave Koenig, a director at the National Restaurant Association, agrees. “We do think that ultimately the consumer will get a reduction in prices just because of the competitive nature of the industry.”  A recent survey from Direct Response Forum, an annual meeting of payment professionals, provided a different assessment.  Its survey of 169 retail executives found that 41 percent of merchants said they won’t pass on the savings, and 56 percent weren’t sure.  Durbin is standing by the fee limits. He issued a statement on Thursday blasting Bank of America and touting the benefits of the rules once they go into effect on October 1.  “Small business and merchants will benefit from fee relief and consumers will benefit from lower prices,” Durbin said. “And banks that try to make up their excess profits off the backs of their customers will finally learn how a competitive market works.”  ",9302011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-financial-regulation-debit/analysis-u-s-consumers-get-swiped-in-debit-fee-crackdown-idUSTRE78T50O20110930
45,V,Payment processor Visa Argentina for sale -sources," * Visa Argentina could fetch more than $500 million   * Owned by group of Visa-issuing banks   * Apollo, Advent, GA among likely bidders   * Morgan Stanley is advising the seller   By Paritosh Bansal and Brenton Cordeiro   Sept 30 (Reuters) - Visa Argentina, a payment processor owned by a group of banks including Banco Santander Rio SA (RIO.BA), is for sale and could fetch more than $500 million, sources familiar with the situation said.   Morgan Stanley (MS.N) is advising on the auction, which is still in the early stages, the sources said.   Private equity firms, including General Atlantic, Advent International and Apollo Global Management (APO.N), may be among the likely bidders, the sources said.   Visa Argentina, which traces its roots back to the 1970s and is owned by several Visa-issuing banks, is one of the largest payment processors in the country and competes with KKR’s (KKR.N) First Data.   Besides Banco Santander Rio, some 40 other banks are in the Visa Argentina network, including Citibank (C.N) and HSBC Bank Argentina (HSBA.L), according to the company’s website.   Visa Argentina and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.  Advent and General Atlantic declined to comment, while Apollo did not return a call seeking comment.   The payment processor industry in Argentina is still nascent compared with countries like the United States, but it is expected to grow.   “Argentina is a market where the processors get pretty high margins because it is still an emerging market area,” said Robert W Baird analyst David Koning.   Credit and debit card issuance has been growing by double digits in Argentina, with banks getting more aggressive in marketing plastic to Argentines.   Last year, Argentina’s Grupo Supervielle bought GE Money’s (GE.N) Argentine credit card portfolio for an undisclosed amount.   Visa Argentina has about $85 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), the sources said.   It could fetch 6 to 7 times EBITDA or more, the sources said. The price would depend on the firm’s growth prospects, and with private equity in the fray, the cost of debt financing to do a deal.   Payment processing businesses are attractive to private equity firms in part because high cash-flow allows buyout shops to use debt to buy them.   But financing has become less available and more expensive for private equity deals lately as the European debt crisis and a weak U.S. economy roil markets and make lenders more cautious.

Paulo newspaper reported.   FIFA has asked Brazil to suspend several laws while it hosts the World Cup, including one that requires theatrical and sports events to provide half-price tickets to people over 65, the paper reported on Saturday.   The laws, FIFA says, threaten to increase the governing body’s costs, reduce its ability to protect its brands and sponsors’ trademarks and to saddle FIFA with other legal liabilities, Estado said, citing Orlando Silva, Brazil’s sports minister.   Rousseff plans to meet FIFA President Joseph Blatter in Brussels on Monday and is ready to compromise on a series of FIFA complaints, Silva told the newspaper.   They include some prohibitions on alcohol sales and rules that grant low-cost tickets to students and youth, the newspaper said. She won’t suspend the Elderly Persons’ Statute or consumer protection laws, it reported.   Rousseff’s office would not confirm or deny a meeting. Brazil’s sports ministry and FIFA’s media department did not return phone calls Saturday.   FIFA’s complaints come after criticism of delays in the construction or repair of stadiums and the expansion of public transport facilities for the World Cup. Allegations have also been rising about cost overruns and corruption related to the World Cup and the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics.[ID:nS1E78C1CF] [ID:nLDE72S2GA]   FIFA 2014 World Cup sponsors include Adidas (ADSGn.DE), Coca-Cola (KO.N), Sony (6758.T), Anheuser-Busch InBev’s Budweiser unit (ABI.BR) and McDonald’s (MCD.N) and Visa (V.N).   The World Cup Bill being debated in Congress, for example, fails to provide sufficient penalties to companies and individuals who sell pirate goods or infringe trademarks, it said, citing Silva.   The penalties are three months to two years in jail or a fine, which FIFA considers “innocuous,” Estado reported.

The suit, which seeks national class action status, was filed on Wednesday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on behalf of the National ATM Council and several independent ATM operators. The suit, charging restraint of trade, alleges that Visa and MasterCard network rules prohibit ATM operators from offering lower prices for transactions over PIN-debit networks that are not affiliated with Visa or MasterCard. The suit alleges that the price fixing artificially raises the price consumers pay for ATM services, limits ATM operator revenue, and violates antitrust laws. It claims that rules by the card issuers prevent an operator from offering consumers a discount for ATM transactions not completed over Visa or MasterCard networks. “Visa and MasterCard are the ringleaders, organizers, and enforcers of a conspiracy among U.S. banks to fix the price of ATM access fees in order to keep the competition at bay,” Jonathan Rubin, of the Rubin PLLC law firm which represents the plaintiffs, said in a statement.

50,V,Top banks accused of colluding on ATM fees,"(Reuters) - A New Jersey man sued Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo on Wednesday on behalf of ATM users, accusing the banks of colluding to fix the fees they charge customers to withdraw money. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., is the third such suit seeking class action status on the issue of automated teller machine fees in the past week. The latest suit alleges the banks worked with Visa and MasterCard to set artificially high rates on ATM fees. The earlier lawsuits were filed against Visa and MasterCard, Wednesday’s lawsuit is directed at both the card network firms and the banks. Customers who use ATMs not operated by their bank are often charged both by the operating bank and by their own bank, as a “foreign ATM transaction” fee. Successful ATM operators need access to the Visa and MasterCard networks, since the vast majority of debit cards are exclusive to them. Some cards can access alternate, cheaper networks. The lawsuits accuse Visa and MasterCard of forcing ATM operators to charge the same access fee to customers regardless of which network they use, in order to get access to the Visa and MasterCard networks. One of the other lawsuits was filed by a group representing the operators of ATMs. Wednesday’s lawsuit accused the banks, that collect the access fees, of colluding with Visa and MasterCard in setting the transaction price. A spokesman for JPMorgan declined comment. Representatives for Bank of America and Wells Fargo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

51,V,"WikiLeaks says ""blockade"" threatens its existence","LONDON (Reuters) - WikiLeaks will have to stop publishing secret cables and devote itself to fund-raising if it is unable to end a financial “blockade” by U.S. firms such as Visa and MasterCard by the end of the year, founder Julian Assange said on Monday. After releasing tens of thousands of confidential U.S. government cables, WikiLeaks needs $3.5 million over the next year to continue operating, Assange said. Visa and MasterCard stopped processing donations for WikiLeaks in December 2010 after the United States criticized the organization’s release of thousands of sensitive U.S. diplomatic cables from its embassies all over the world. In the 24 hours before credit card donations were blocked, the organization said it had received $135,000. Now, it is receiving on average about 7,000 euros ($9,700)a month. Assange said there were no lawful grounds for the blockade by Bank of America Corp, Visa Inc, MasterCard Inc, eBay Inc unit PayPal and Western Union Co, which he said had cost Wikileaks 95 percent of its revenue. “If WikiLeaks does not find a way to remove this blockade, given our current levels of expenditure, we will simply not be able to continue by the turn of the year,” Assange told a news conference. In July, WikiLeaks filed a complaint to the Directorate-General for Competition of the European Commission, saying Visa and MasterCard had breached antitrust provisions set out by the EU Treaty. Assange, who is fighting extradition from Britain to Sweden, where he faces allegations of sexual misconduct, said he hoped the European Commission would make a decision to hold a full investigation by mid-November. In interviews last year, Assange said WikiLeaks had extensive internal documents from a bank, believed to be Bank of America, an announcement that knocked 3 percent off the value of the bank’s shares. However, on Monday he said this data was now out of WikiLeaks’ hands and in the possession of an unnamed suspended WikiLeaks employee. “At this stage, we do not believe, unfortunately, that we will regain that material, which is a great loss,” he said. Daniel Domscheit-Berg, who last year was fired by Assange as WikiLeaks’ co-spokesman, told Reuters in August that he had destroyed about 3,000 submissions that WikiLeaks had received relating to Bank of America.

Daniel Domscheit-Berg, who last year was fired by Assange as WikiLeaks’ co-spokesman, told Reuters in August that he had destroyed about 3,000 submissions that WikiLeaks had received relating to Bank of America.",10242011,http://www.reuters.com/article/britain-wikileaks/update-2-wikileaks-says-blockade-threatens-its-existence-idUSL5E7LO2LW20111024
53,V,"Visa, Mastercard execs say debit card use to grow","* Debit now 40 percent of consumer purchases -Visa exec * New rules will not curb rising debit use By Joe Rauch LAS VEGAS, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Debit and ATM executives for MasterCard Inc and Visa Inc said on Wednesday they expect debit card use to grow, despite new U.S. government rules that cap fees banks can charge merchants. Executives for the world’s two largest payment processors said at an industry conference on Wednesday that consumers will increasingly use debit cards for everyday purchases, despite fears their use could be curbed due to price caps introduced by the Dodd-Frank financial reform law’s Durbin amendment. “Consumers are flocking to debit cards because they are intrinsically superior to checks,” said Leland Englebardt, Mastercard’s group head for global network products, overseeing the company’s ATM business. Englebardt was part of a panel at the ATM, Debit and Prepaid Forum, an annual industry conference. The Durbin amendment caps so-called interchange fees, or what banks and payment processors can charge merchants at 21 cents per transaction, roughly half what the previous industry average. The cut could lead to banks and payment processors from allowing debit card transactions for smaller, everyday purchases, some analysts projected. Several large U.S. banks, including Bank of America Corp , proposed — and then scrapped — plans to impose monthly debit card fees to offset the lost revenue. The new price cap went into effect on Oct. 1. Now roughly a month into the new rule, executives on the panel said they all saw a slight uptick in debit card processing during October. Kimberly Lawrence, Visa’s head of consumer products strategy and execution, said the San Francisco-based payment processing company projects debit transactions make up about 40 percent of consumer purchases, and will continue to grow. “Regulation doesn’t change any of those factors,” she said.

56,V,Asian internet shoppers turning cautious - Visa survey,"SINGAPORE, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Asian internet shoppers are turning cautious, according to a survey by credit card company Visa, with half of respondents saying they plan to keep their year-end shopping budgets at the same level as in 2010. “Shoppers are more cautious this year with their spending. Even if they said they were spending more, they were doing so mainly to keep up with the rising cost of products,” Paul Jung, Visa’s head of eCommerce for Asia-Pacific, Central Europe, Middle East and Africa, said in a statement. “The exception was China where respondents said it was because they wanted to buy more expensive items,” he added. According to the Visa survey of 4,033 people in Australia, China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, 31 percent of shoppers said they planned to spend more online, while 18 percent said they would cut down on expenses. The Visa survey appears to show shoppers in Asia are more cautious than their peers in the United States, who flocked to stores and online shopping sites last weekend as the holiday season kicked off. But it is not certain that retailers will be able to keep that momentum going for the rest of the season. While most Asian economies rebounded strongly from the 2008/09 financial crisis, unlike those in the West, the region has felt a chill in recent months from Europe’s deepening debt crisis, slumping financial markets and sluggish U.S. demand.",11302011,http://www.reuters.com/article/asia-shoppers/asian-internet-shoppers-turning-cautious-visa-survey-idUSL4E7MU0JV20111130

61,V,US House insider trading bill takes dig at Pelosi,"* House Republicans add curb on lawmaker access to IPOs * “Pelosi Provision” highlights Visa shares bought in 2008 * Cantor text seeks disclosures from 30,000 other govt officials By David Lawder WASHINGTON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives will take an election-year dig at top Democrat Nancy Pelosi in changes added to a fast-moving ethics bill, adding new curbs to prevent government officials from gaining special access to initial public stock offerings. A senior House Republican aide said on Tuesday the so-called “Pelosi Provision” would strengthen the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act passed by the U.S. Senate last week. The bill, scheduled for a House vote on Thursday, aims to prevent lawmakers from using inside knowledge gained through their positions to profit in the stock market by subjecting them to new trading disclosure requirements. The provision, one of a number of changes drafted by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, aims to shine a spotlight on Pelosi’s husband’s purchase of shares in the 2008 initial public offering by Visa Inc as Congress was considering new credit card regulations. The CBS news show “60 Minutes” highlighted the transaction as one of several controversial trades by lawmakers in a piece last November that drew national attention to the profits generated by Congress’ inside knowledge — and sparked new support for a bill that had languished in the House for years. Within two days of the Visa offering, the 5,000 shares purchased by Paul Pelosi had risen $20 each. House Republicans widely described the addition as the “Pelosi Provision” on Capitol Hill, with specific references to the Visa transaction in the 60 Minutes piece. “The Pelosi provision prohibits members of Congress, executive branch officials and their staffs from receiving special access to initial public offerings because of their position,” the senior House Republican aide said. Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill declined comment until the House changes to the insider trading bill are released. “We look forward to reviewing to the text of the bill Leader Cantor is writing in secret,” he added. But Pelosi aides said that her husband, Paul, did not gain any special access to the IPO. He purchased them through his existing broker at Wells Fargo, one of the 41 banks that were underwriters in the $17.9 billion IPO, the largest in U.S. history. The House Republican changes could add some partisan rancor to what has been an unusual display of support from both parties for the “clean government” measure in a deeply divided Congress. The Senate passed its version last week by a vote of 96-3. Democrats also on Tuesday protested that Cantor’s changes were being made behind closed doors without their input. “How ironic. Insiders now appear to be writing a bill meant to ban insider trading,” said Congressman Tim Walz, a Minnesota Democrat who had reintroduced a version of the STOCK Act last year. At a news conference, Walz called on Republicans to “bring this dang thing out in the open.” Like the Senate bill, the House changes are expected to  extend requirements that stock trades be disclosed electronically within 30 days to officials in the Executive Branch agencies and independent regulatory bodies. But rather than forcing more than 300,000 lower-level employees as called for under one Senate amendment, the House version would limit this to about 30,000 higher-level officials. Language of the Republican changes to the bill was expected to be released later on Tuesday.",2082012,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-congress-insidertrading/us-house-insider-trading-bill-takes-dig-at-pelosi-idUSL2E8D7LKN20120208

63,V,"Security breach hits U.S. card processors, banks","(Reuters) - Four giant card-payment processors and large U.S. banks that issue debit and credit cards were hit by a data-security breach after third-party services provider Global Payments Inc discovered its systems were compromised by unauthorized access. It was not immediately clear how many cardholders became victims of the breach, which affected MasterCard Inc, Visa Inc, American Express Co and Discover Financial Services, as well as banks and other franchises that issue cards bearing their logos. U.S. law enforcement authorities including the Secret Service are investigating and MasterCard said it has hired an independent data-security organization to review the incident. The shares of Atlanta-based Global Payments, which acts as a credit-checking middleman between merchants and card processors, were halted on Friday afternoon after dropping more than 9 percent on the news. MasterCard shares fell 1.8 percent to close at $420.54, Visa shares dropped 0.8 percent to $118, American Express shares fell 0.1 percent to $57.86, while Discover rose 1.2 percent to $33.34. Analysts said any financial losses from the data breach would be shouldered by merchants, card issuers and Global Payments rather than Visa or Mastercard, which operate payment networks. Global Payments said it determined that an unauthorized entity had accessed its systems and possible customer card data in early March. Krebs on Security, a blog that first reported the incident on Friday, said accounts had been compromised for over a month, between January 21, 2012 and February 25, 2012. Global Payments is holding an investor conference call Monday morning to discuss the issue. This Global Payments breach is just the latest in a long string of incidents that have put the personal information of millions of credit and debit cardholders at risk. Individual banks and processors said they had not yet determined the full extent of the breach, but Krebs on Security described it as a “massive” breach that may affect more than 10 million cardholders. Some industry experts suggested the figure might be much less, perhaps on the order of tens of thousands. Bernstein Research analyst Rod Bourgeois noted that Global Payments is a relatively small player in the transactions services industry, servicing 800,000 merchants with a 3.5 percent market share. By contrast, the largest competitor, First Data, services millions of merchants, with 22.6 percent of the market. JPMorgan Chase & Co, as well as American Express and Discover, which issue their own cards, said they are monitoring customers’ accounts and would issue new cards to anyone whose information may have been compromised. Citigroup Inc said it has been notified by processors of the breach. Bank of America Corp declined to comment on the matter and Wells Fargo & Co said it was too early to comment on the impact. Banks and processors emphasized customers would not be held liable for any fraudulent charges that may occur. Mike Simonsen, the Chief Executive of real-estate research company Altos Research, said he may have been a victim. Simonsen said he was contacted by his bank, Bank of America Corp, last week about his Visa card. Although there were no unauthorized transactions, the representative told him a vendor or law enforcement agency had flagged his account as compromised and so he would receive a new one. “It was very unusual,” he said. Global Payments, which has about 3,700 employees, was spun off from information-services firm National Data Corp in 2001. For the fiscal year ended May 31, Global Payment reported revenue of $1.9 billion, an increase of 13 percent from the year-earlier period. According to a company presentation in January, the company was projected to report fiscal 2012 revenue in the range of $2.15 billion. The company is scheduled to report fiscal third-quarter results on Wednesday and there had been the expectation Global Payments would report improving results. On Wednesday, Sterne Agee raised its price target for Global Payments to $65 a share from $58. Global Payments is one of dozens of companies that operate along the payment-processing chain, between the time a person swipes a card to pay and the time the payment is delivered. The account number, expiration date and possibly the cardholder’s name is sent from the point of payment to a processor, which then connects to Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Discover. Information is then sent to the card issuer — often a bank — which ultimately authorizes the transaction. The actual transfer of money occurs later. Processing companies, which perform millions of authorizations each day, are supposed to encrypt card information. But a breach could occur if someone gains access to the system and identifies a gap in the encryption. The information that was likely collected illegally from Global Payments is called Track 1 and Track 2 data. A person improperly using the information can transfer the account number and expiration date to a magnetic strip on a card and then try to use the card on a website. Thousands of U.S. banks that issue credit and debit cards receive daily alerts regarding breaches through a system referred to as CAMS, said Thomas McCrohan, an analyst with Janney Capital Markets. The illegal use of the data could be stymied if an online merchant asks for the three or four digits printed on a card known as the “CVV code.” “The systems can all be made tighter, but if they’re too tight no transactions would ever be approved,” said Edward Lawrence, a director at Auriemma Consulting Group, a payment systems consultant. “You still have to allow commerce to occur.” Rep. Mary Bono, a California Republican who chairs the House Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade, condemned the Global Payments breach and urged Congress to adopt stronger data-security legislation this year. “You shouldn’t have to cross your fingers and whisper a prayer when you type in a credit card number on your computer and hit ‘enter,’” she said in a statement. The Visa-Mastercard-Discover breach is the first major instance this year of consumer information put at risk by technological flaws or hacking, but there are plenty of examples of massive data breaches in recent years affecting banks, retailers, technology companies and payment processors. Last June, Citigroup said computer hackers breached the bank’s network and accessed data of about 200,000 cardholders in North America. Sony Corp also reported several recent attacks, including one last year in which hackers accessed the personal information on 77 million PlayStation Network accounts. Google Inc suffered a major attack on its Gmail accounts in 2011 that it said appeared to originate in China. Attacks against Gmail users involved direct attempts to compromise accounts by tricking users into revealing information - so-called “phishing” - or by gathering their passwords from other websites, rather than compromising Google systems, according to the company. Separately, TJX Companies Inc and Heartland Payment Systems Inc have had their systems compromised. On Friday, retailers were already beginning to look for fraudulent purchases from the compromised card accounts stemming from the Global Payments breach. They will bear the financial brunt of those crimes under rules worked out with the card associations and issuers, analysts said. “Our merchant community is sitting here girding itself and looking at their own fraud-prevention strategies and bracing for the influx of bad transactions,” said Tom Donlea, managing director for the Americas at the nonprofit Merchant Risk Council. “After Heartland and after the Sony breach, there was an increase in fraud activity.” (This version of the story corrects paragraph 29 to delete statement Google systems were compromised and adds that Gmail users were targets of a “phishing” scam) ",3302012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mastercard-breach/security-breach-hits-u-s-card-processors-banks-idUSBRE82T0VD20120330

Processor Global Payments Inc said on Friday it had found “unauthorized access” into its system early in March and notified law enforcement and financial institutions. Payment network operators MasterCard Inc, Visa Inc , American Express Co and Discover Financial Services confirmed they were affected, along with banks and other franchises that issue cards bearing their logos. A spokesman for the Secret Service said the agency is leading investigations into the case but declined to give any details.

Global Payments, which has about 3,700 employees, was spun off from information-services firm National Data Corp in 2001. For the fiscal year ended May 31, Global Payment reported revenue of $1.9 billion, up 13 percent from the year-earlier period. According to a company presentation in January, it es timated fisca l 2012 revenue at ab out $2.15 billion. Global Payments is scheduled to report fiscal third-quarter results on Wednesday and a n improvement is expected. On Wednesday, Sterner Agee raised its st ock p rice target for Global Payments to $65 from $58. Global Payments is one of dozens of companies that operate along the payment-processing chain, between the time a person swipes a card to pay and the time the payment is delivered. The account number, expiration date and possibly the cardholder’s name is sent from the point of payment to a processor, which then connects to Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Discover. Information is then sent to the card issuer - often a bank - which ultimately authorizes the transaction. The actual transfer of money occurs later. Processing companies, which perform millions of authorizations each day, are supposed to encrypt card information. But a breach could occur if someone gains access to the system and identifies a gap in the encryption. The information that was likely collected illegally from Global Payments is called Track 1 and Track 2 data. A person improperly using the information can transfer the account number and expiration date to a magnetic strip on a card and then try to use the card on a website. Thousands of U.S. banks that issue credit and debit cards receive daily alerts regarding breaches, said Thomas McCrohan, an analyst with Jane Capital Markets. The illegal use of the data could be stymied if an online merchant asks for the three or four digits printed on a card known as the “CV code.” “The systems can all be made tighter, but if they’re too tight no transactions would ever be approved,” said Edward Lawrence, a director at Auriemma Consulting Group, a payment systems consultant. “You still have to allow commerce to occur.” Rep. Mary Bono, a California Republican who chairs the House Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade, condemned the Global Payments breach and urged Congress to adopt stronger data-security legislation this year. “You shouldn’t have to cross your fingers and whisper a prayer when you type in a credit card number on your computer and hit ‘enter,’” she said in a statement. The breach is the first major instance this year of consumer information put at risk by technological flaws or hacking, but there are plenty of examples of massive data breaches in recent years affecting banks, retailers, technology companies and payment processors. Last June, Citigroup said computer hackers breached the bank’s network and accessed data of about 200,000 cardholders in North America. Sony Corp  also reported several recent attacks, including one last year in which hackers accessed the personal information on 77 million PlayStation Network accounts. Google Inc suffered a major attack on its Gmail accounts in 2011 that it said appeared to originate in China. Attacks against Gmail users involved direct attempts to compromise accounts by tricking users into revealing information - so-called “phishing” - or by gathering their passwords from other websites, rather than compromising Google systems, according to the company. Separately, TJX Co Inc and Heartland Payment Systems Inc have had their systems compromised. On Friday, retailers were already beginning to look for fraudulent purchases from the compromised card accounts stemming from the Global Payments breach. They will bear the financial brunt of those crimes under rules worked out with the card associations and issuers, analysts said. “Our merchant community is sitting here girding itself and looking at their own fraud-prevention strategies and bracing for the influx of bad transactions,” said Tom Donlea, managing director for the Americas at the nonprofit Merchant Risk Council. “After Heartland and after the Sony breach, there was an increase in fraud activity.”",3312012,http://www.reuters.com/article/mastercard-breach/update-4-security-breach-hits-u-s-card-processors-banks-idUSL2E8EV00620120331
66,V,Firm dropped by Visa says under 1.5 million card numbers stolen,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N) has dropped payment processor Global Payments Inc (GPN.N) from its list of approved service providers after a major cyber intrusion that could expose Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover card holders to fraud. Global Payments said it believes less than 1.5 million credit card numbers were stolen in the cyber security breach. It said so-called Track 2 card data was stolen but card holders’ names, addresses and social security numbers were not obtained. It also believes the affected part of its processing system is confined to North America. Visa, the world’s largest credit and debit-card processing network, said it removed the company from its registry of compliant service providers due to “unauthorized access into a portion of (Global Payments’) processing system”. It told Global Payments to revalidate its compliance processes with the payment card industry’s data security standard. Global Payments, which is based in Atlanta and has estimated its revenues will top $2 billion this financial year, will hold a conference call with investors on Monday morning. A person improperly using Track 2 information can transfer the account number and expiration date of a card to a magnetic stripe on a fraudulent card and then try to use it to make online purchases. The attempt could be blocked, however, if an online merchant asks for the CVV code, or the three or four digits usually located on the back of card. Global Payments is one of dozens of companies that operate along the payment-processing chain. They are targeted by hackers due to the vast amount of sensitive financial information they handle. The breach was first reported by a blog on computer security and cybercrime, Krebs on Security, which said it could affect more than 10 million card holders. Global Payments spokeswoman Amy Corn said although the company had been taken off Visa’s list of compliant service providers it continued to process transactions. “We expect to be reinstated once we have been issued a new report of compliance,” she said.

69,V,Visa Inc beats estimates with higher profit,"(Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N), the world’s largest credit and debit-card network, beat analysts’ estimates with a 23 percent increase in adjusted earnings as people spent more with cards. The company also raised the high-end of its estimated range for full-year earnings per share, despite uncertainty over questions from United States government anti-trust investigators on how it is adjusting to new federal limits on fees charged merchants for debit card transactions. Quarterly profit, excluding an accounting benefit from a revaluation of deferred tax liabilities, rose 23 percent from a year earlier to $1.08 billion, or $1.60 a share, the company said. Analysts, on average, had estimated that Visa would earn $1.51 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company also disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it received a “civil investigative demand” on March 13 from the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice for documents and information about its response to a new law and rules limiting debit card fees. CEO Joseph Saunders said later in a conference call with analysts that, while he does not know the goal of the investigators, “obviously they must have a concern” that Visa is taking actions that would undermine the new rules. “We are confident our actions are appropriate,” Saunders said. The company has met with the department twice and provided materials to investigators, he added. Visa will inevitably lose some of its dominant market share of the so-called “swipe fee” revenue as a result of the new regulations, Saunders said. The new rules grew out of a law that was enacted following lobbying by retailers, many of whom have long been at odds with major credit and debit card companies over the fees they charge for handling transactions. The company has received requests for information from the department on four other occasions since 2007 and those inquiries took nine to 24 months to complete. With the new case, he said, “we have, obviously, very seriously considered various things that may or may not happen, and we have taken it into consideration in crafting our guidance” for full-year financial results. The company forecast that earnings per share for the full fiscal year would increase by a percentage in the “high teens to low twenties.” It said three months earlier that it expected the growth would be in the high teens. The financial report on Wednesday covered the three months ended March 31, which was the second quarter of the company’s fiscal year. Without the adjustment for the tax liability, net income for the quarter was $1.29 billion, or $1.91 a share, compared with $811 million, or $1.23 a share, a year earlier, the company said on Wednesday after the close of New York Stock Exchange trading.

73,V,"Americans to spend less, travel more over July 4th","NEW YORK, July 2 (Reuters) - Americans plan to spend less, travel more and have plenty of cookouts over the Independence Day holiday this week, according to surveys. Spending for the July 4 holiday is expected to be down 12 percent, according to a Visa poll released on Sunday, dropping to an average of $191 per person. Two-thirds of all Americans plan on a simple cookout, according to a National Retail Federation survey released in June. But both surveys showed a significant minority of people will not celebrate at all — Visa survey said 21 percent and the retail group said 10.6 percent. The retail federation projected that 67.6 percent of Americans plan a cookout or barbecue, while 48.5 percent will watch fireworks. Some 12.6 percent planned to travel or take a vacation over the holiday. Cynthia Brough, a spokeswoman for the American Automobile Association, said the organization is projecting 42.3 million Americans will drive 50 miles or more during the Independence Day holiday, up 4.9 percent from last year. Lower gas prices, at $3.33 a gallon nationwide compared with $3.55 a year ago, are a factor in the longer drives. Despite economic concerns, “What the survey indicates is that Americans have an appetite for travel...,” Brough said. Median spending on trips, according to the AAA, is expected to be $749 per person, down 7 percent from last year’s total of  around $800 per person. “While more people are traveling, they’re economizing,” Brough said. The drop in spending is not limited to travel costs. Some 43 percent of Americans were not planning to buy any patriotic merchandise, including flags, apparel and decorations, compared with 23 percent who were, according to the retail survey. Midwesterners will spend the most to celebrate the holiday, laying out an average of $211, while those in the Northeast will spending $40 less, the Visa survey found. According to Jason Alderman, senior director of global financial education at Visa, the holiday is bigger in Midwestern cities and towns, while Northeastern cities have more  concentrated gatherings and firework displays. The distance Americans will travel this year will rise by 150 miles to an average of 723 miles per traveler, and 18 percent of all trips will be in excess of 1,500 miles, an increase over last year’s 10 percent. Factors contributing to the increase include air travel and the holiday falling on a Wednesday, which allows many Americans to extend their long weekends into trips as long as nine days, including two weekends. Eighty-four percent of those traveling will do so by car; 8 percent will fly; and 8 percent will travel by train or cruise ship.

75,V,"Visa, MasterCard edging closer to fee pact: report","(Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) could reach a settlement this month in a lawsuit in which retailers accuse the payment networks of charging excessive credit card fees, Bloomberg News reported, citing people briefed on the matter. The seven-year old case in Brooklyn federal court accuses Visa and Mastercard of conspiring to raise stores’ fees for processing their payment cards. Visa, Mastercard and the banks that issue their payment cards are accused of working together to steer merchants toward certain forms of payment. U.S. District Judge John Gleeson has supervised at least three settlement conferences between the parties since December, the court docket showed. A trial is tentatively scheduled to begin in September. Spokespersons for Visa and MasterCard declined to comment on Friday. A lawyer for the plaintiffs, Craig Wildfang, declined to comment. Other lawyers for the defendants either declined to comment or did not immediately return requests for comment Friday. In a June 25 analyst report, Morgan Stanley analysts led by Glenn Fodor said senior leaders from Visa and MasterCard participated in two days of settlement talks last month, a sign that Judge Gleeson is pressing for a settlement. “Our view has always been that there is a very low likelihood of this case going to trial, and these actions by the court support that view,” the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. Merchants who brought the lawsuit — including D’Agostino Supermarkets Inc and Payless Shoe Source — said rules that prevent them from offering discounts for paying in cash or pushing customers toward a less costly form of payment are costing stores an estimated $50 billion each year. The case raises similar claims to another consolidated set of cases in Brooklyn federal court, filed by retailers in 1996. Visa and Mastercard paid $3.05 billion to settle that case, which only covered conduct up to January 1, 2004. According to plaintiffs in the latest case, the card companies’ behavior has continued virtually unchanged since then. Merchants bringing the latest case estimate that monetary damages could run into the tens of billions of dollars — a figure that Visa and MasterCard deny. In its report, Morgan Stanley agreed with the consensus estimate that the settlement could cost about $10 billion. MasterCard would likely pay its portion over several years while Visa would be “insulated from direct economic exposure” because of a plan already in place to cover the costs of the settlement. Banks that issue credit cards could also be affected by the settlement. Interchange fees could be lowered and banks could pay penalties partly covered by the shares they received in Visa’s public stock offering, according to the report. “Any greater reduction in interchange fees or penalties is likely a negative for bank stocks, though the degree of impact will ultimately be a function of the overall terms of the settlement,” the report said.

77,V,"Visa, MasterCard, banks in $7.25 billion retail settlement","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa Inc, MasterCard Inc and banks that issue their credit cards have agreed to a $7.25 billion settlement with U.S. retailers in a lawsuit over the fixing of credit and debit card fees in what could be the largest antitrust settlement in U.S. history. The settlement, if approved by a judge, would resolve dozens of lawsuits filed by retailers in 2005. The card companies and banks would also allow stores to start charging customers extra for using certain credit cards in an effort to steer them toward cheaper forms of payment. The settlement papers were filed Friday in Brooklyn federal court. The proposal involves a payment to a class of stores of $6 billion from Visa, MasterCard and more than a dozen of the country’s largest banks who issue the companies’ cards. The card companies have also agreed to reduce swipe fees by the equivalent of 10 basis points for eight months for a total consideration to stores valued at about $1.2 billion, according to lawyers for the plaintiffs. An additional $525 million will be paid to stores suing individually, according to the documents. “This is an historic settlement,” said Bonny Sweeney, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. “In addition to refunding billions of dollars to retailers that paid artificially inflated interchange fees, the reforms will create real price competition, leading to reduced card-acceptance fees for retailers.” Noah Hanft, general counsel for MasterCard, said the company believed its interests were “best served by an amicable resolution” of the case. Visa CEO Joseph Saunders said the settlement was in the best interest of all parties and did not expect the settlement to impact its current guidance. But not everyone was pleased with the proposal. One class plaintiff, the National Association of Convenience Stores, slammed the deal in a statement from its president, Tom Robinson, who is also president of Robinson Oil Corp. “Not only does the proposed settlement fail to introduce competition and transparency, it actually provides Visa and MasterCard with the tools to continue to shield swipe fees from market forces,” Robinson said. The proposed considerations are a far cry from the $50 billion in swipe-fees paid each year by U.S. retailers, he said. The American Bankers Association, a trade group whose members include the bank defendants, said retailers, not consumers, stood to gain the most from the proposed settlement. “Big-box retailers will likely seize this opportunity to ask Congress for even more handouts,” said ABA president Frank Keating in a statement, referring to the Durbin amendment passed by Congress in 2010 limiting debit-card swipe fees - a move that banks say resulted in an $8 billion windfall for retailers. “The legal process worked and should send a signal to Congress that it is wrong to pick winners and losers in a complex dispute between two industries,” the Electronic Payment Coalition, which represents payment networks, said in a statement. Stores said Visa and MasterCard colluded directly and indirectly through the issuing banks to keep merchants from finding ways to mitigate credit-card costs. Plaintiffs in the case include supermarket chain Kroger Co, pharmacy chain Rite-Aid Corp and shoe retailer Payless ShoeSource, as well as trade associations such as the National Association of Convenience Stores, National Grocers Association and the American Booksellers Association. A number of banks that issue Visa and MasterCard cards, including JP Morgan Chase & Co, were also named as defendants in the lawsuit, along with Visa and MasterCard’s payment networks. A spokeswoman for Bank of America NA said it believed the terms of the settlement were fair. JP Morgan declined to comment. Citigroup Inc acknowledged its role in the deal and declined further comment. Swipe fees are set by the card companies and deducted from the transaction by the banks that issue the cards, essentially passing on the cost to merchants, the lawsuits said. An estimated 7 million retailers will be affected by the settlement, according to lawyers for the plaintiffs. Visa and MasterCard have been plagued by legal problems over their payment-card policies for the last decade. In 2003, the companies paid a combined $3 billion to settle a lawsuit by stores over their “honor all cards” policies, which tied acceptance of credit to debit cards. The U.S. Department of Justice brought and settled a civil antitrust suit against Visa and MasterCard in 2010. As part of the consent decree, the companies agreed to drop certain policies that kept stores from steering their customers to cheaper forms of payment. But the decree left intact policies that prohibit stores from charging customers more when they use certain payment cards, according to a July 2011 court filing from plaintiffs. The defendants denied that any collusion took place. In December, Visa announced it set aside an additional $1.57 billion to cover the cost of a potential settlement in the case, bringing its litigation reserve balance to $4.28 billion, according to a regulatory filing. MasterCard in the fourth quarter of 2011 recorded a $770 million pretax charge, as an estimate of its potential liability in the case, a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed. MasterCard said in a statement that it expected to incur an additional $20 million pre-tax charge in its 2012 second quarter financial statements to cover its portion of the settlement. Visa and MasterCard together accounted for more than 80 percent of U.S. credit and debit card purchases by volume in 2011, according to data from the Nilson Report, a California trade publication. The case is In re: Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, no. 05-1720.

The card companies have also agreed to reduce swipe fees by the equivalent of 10 basis points for eight months for a total consideration to stores valued at about $1.2 billion, according to lawyers for the plaintiffs. An additional $525 million will be paid to stores suing individually, according to the documents. “This is an historic settlement,” said Bonny Sweeney, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. “In addition to refunding billions of dollars to retailers that paid artificially inflated interchange fees, the reforms will create real price competition, leading to reduced card-acceptance fees for retailers.” Noah Hanft, general counsel for MasterCard, said the company believed its interests were “best served by an amicable resolution” of the case. Visa CEO Joseph Saunders said the settlement was in the best interest of all parties and did not expect the settlement to impact its current guidance. But not everyone was pleased with the proposal. One class plaintiff, the National Association of Convenience Stores, slammed the deal in a statement from its president, Tom Robinson, who is also president of Robinson Oil Corp. “Not only does the proposed settlement fail to introduce competition and transparency, it actually provides Visa and MasterCard with the tools to continue to shield swipe fees from market forces,” Robinson said. The proposed considerations are a far cry from the $50 billion in swipe-fees paid each year by U.S. retailers, he said. The American Bankers Association, a trade group whose members include the bank defendants, said retailers, not consumers, stood to gain the most from the proposed settlement. “Big-box retailers will likely seize this opportunity to ask Congress for even more handouts,” said ABA president Frank Keating in a statement, referring to the Durbin amendment passed by Congress in 2010 limiting debit-card swipe fees - a move that banks say resulted in an $8 billion windfall for retailers. “The legal process worked and should send a signal to Congress that it is wrong to pick winners and losers in a complex dispute between two industries,” the Electronic Payment Coalition, which represents payment networks, said in a statement. Stores said Visa and MasterCard colluded directly and indirectly through the issuing banks to keep merchants from finding ways to mitigate credit-card costs. Plaintiffs in the case include supermarket chain Kroger Co , pharmacy chain Rite-Aid Corp and shoe retailer Payless ShoeSource, as well as trade associations such as the National Association of Convenience Stores, National Grocers Association and the American Booksellers Association. A number of banks that issue Visa and MasterCard cards, including JP Morgan Chase & Co, were also named as defendants in the lawsuit, along with Visa and MasterCard’s payment networks. A spokeswoman for Bank of America NA said it believed the terms of the settlement were fair. JP Morgan declined to comment. Citigroup Inc acknowledged its role in the deal and declined further comment. Swipe fees are set by the card companies and deducted from the transaction by the banks that issue the cards, essentially passing on the cost to merchants, the lawsuits said. An estimated 7 million retailers will be affected by the settlement, according to lawyers for the plaintiffs. Visa and MasterCard have been plagued by legal problems over their payment-card policies for the last decade. In 2003, the companies paid a combined $3 billion to settle a lawsuit by stores over their “honor all cards” policies, which tied acceptance of credit to debit cards. The U.S. Department of Justice brought and settled a civil antitrust suit against Visa and MasterCard in 2010. As part of the consent decree, the companies agreed to drop certain policies that kept stores from steering their customers to cheaper forms of payment. But the decree left intact policies that prohibit stores from charging customers more when they use certain payment cards, according to a July 2011 court filing from plaintiffs. The defendants denied that any collusion took place. In December, Visa announced it set aside an additional $1.57 billion to cover the cost of a potential settlement in the case, bringing its litigation reserve balance to $4.28 billion, according to a regulatory filing. MasterCard in the fourth quarter of 2011 recorded a $770 million pretax charge, as an estimate of its potential liability in the case, a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed. MasterCard said in a statement that it expected to incur an additional $20 million pre-tax charge in its 2012 second quarter financial statements to cover its portion of the settlement. Visa and MasterCard together accounted for more than 80 percent of U.S. credit and debit card purchases by volume in 2011, according to data from the Nilson Report, a California trade publication.

The settlement, if approved by a judge, would resolve dozens of lawsuits filed by retailers in 2005. The card companies and banks would also allow stores to start charging customers extra for using certain credit cards in an effort to steer them toward cheaper forms of payment. The settlement papers were filed on Friday in Brooklyn federal court. Swipe fees - charges to cover processing credit and debit payments - are set by the card companies and deducted from the transaction by the banks that issue the cards, essentially passing on the cost to merchants, the lawsuits said. The proposed settlement involves a payment to a class of stores of $6 billion from Visa, MasterCard and more than a dozen of the country’s largest banks who issue the companies’ cards. The card companies have also agreed to reduce swipe fees by the equivalent of 10 basis points for eight months for a total consideration to stores valued at about $1.2 billion, according to lawyers for the plaintiffs. The deal calls for merchants to be allowed to negotiate collectively over the swipe fees, also known as interchange fees. Merchants would also be required to disclose information about card fees to customers, and credit card surcharges would be subject to a cap, according to the settlement papers. Surcharge rules would not affect the 10 states that currently prohibit that practice, which include California, New York and Texas. An additional $525 million will be paid to stores suing individually, according to the documents. “This is an historic settlement,” said Bonny Sweeney, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. The settlement “will help shift the competitive balance from one formerly dominated by the banks which controlled the card networks to the side of merchants and consumers,” said Craig Wildfang, who also represented the plaintiffs. Noah Hanft, general counsel for MasterCard, said the company believed its interests were “best served by an amicable resolution” of the case. Visa Chief Executive Officer Joseph Saunders said the settlement was in the best interest of all parties and did not expect the settlement to impact its current guidance.

The National Retail Federation, a trade group representing retailers, said that “the test will be whether the injunctive relief is meaningful. Unless it is, the card market will stay broken and neither merchants nor their customers will achieve a long-term benefit.” A number of banks that issue Visa and MasterCard cards, including JP Morgan Chase & Co, were also named as defendants in the lawsuit, along with Visa and MasterCard’s payment networks.

Albert Foer, president of think-tank the American Antitrust Institute, said that the settlement should create more transparency for consumers at the cash register. Because merchants had been forbidden from charging customers extra for costlier payment forms, they often built that cost into the retail price, he said. While it may not lead to lower prices, “it gives the consumers some choice and it should ultimately mean a better deal for everybody,” Foer said. “In the longer run, it should help keep retail prices under better control.” It may also be the last time retailers are allowed to take Visa and Mastercard to court over interchange fees. The proposal provides for extensive litigation releases that would keep stores that join the settlement from suing over a wide range of issues relating to fees and anti-steering restraints.

Shares of Citigroup gained after the third largest U.S. bank reported profit that came in above analysts’ estimates. Visa Inc shares hit an all-time high and MasterCard Inc advanced after the credit card companies and banks reached a $7.25 billion settlement with U.S. retailers in a lawsuit late on Friday. But the drop in retail sales, the third consecutive monthly decrease, contrasted with economists’ expectations for a small increase and was the latest sign the recovery is flagging. “Three months in a row of lower retail sales is pretty concerning.

Citigroup shares rose 1 percent after profit fell but came in above estimates, while Visa shares hit an all-time high and Mastercard also rose after a lawsuit settlement agreement last week. The S&P; 500 is up roughly 7 percent from a low hit early in June despite consistently worsening economic data. Historic low yields in bonds and expectations that the Federal Reserve could intervene to support the slowing economy have been cited as some of the reasons for investors to stick with equities.

Given that, I’m surprised the market is holding so well,” said Paul Zemsky, head of asset allocation at ING Investment Management in New York. “It could be expectations that earnings could come out better than feared.

85,V,TEXT-Fitch says merchant settlement's impact on card industry muted,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) July 17 - The long-term financial impact on the credit card industry from the $6 billion settlement of the antitrust suit against Visa, MasterCard, and major card-issuing banks will likely be modest, according to Fitch Ratings.   While the agreement reached on July 13 offers merchants an opportunity to  temporarily reduce interchange fees paid to banks, we do not believe that the  fundamental economics of credit card transactions have been changed materially  as a result of the settlement.  In addition to the agreed eight-month cut in swipe fees by 10 bps for merchants  accepting Visa and MasterCard, the settlement also supports a merchants’ ability to impose credit card surcharges on customers to recover part of their  card-related costs.    We believe the October 2010 settlement between Visa, MasterCard, and the U.S.  Department of Justice (DOJ) already provided merchants with some flexibility in  offering incentives for customers to move away from higher cost payment methods  toward debit cards or cash. The incremental impact of the new settlement on  merchants’ willingness to apply card surcharges will likely be limited,  particularly in highly competitive consumer markets where customers would be  expected to respond negatively to surcharges on card transactions.  The introduction of surcharges would also not be permitted in several states  (including California, Massachusetts, New York, and Texas, among others) due to  state-specific laws/regulations that prohibit charging a fee to consumers using  a credit card.   The settlement does not impose a long-term cap on interchange rates, which Fitch believes removes a significant overhang from the card networks. This would have  represented the most negative outcome for card processors and banks over the  long term, given the potential decline in fees.    In terms of the settlement costs, named defendants were adding to litigation  reserves in recent periods, as the case progressed. Given the potential for some merchants to opt out of the settlement, we believe defendants will manage  litigation reserves accordingly.   American Express (AmEx) and Discover Financial were not parties to the merchant  suit, but AmEx continues to fight the October 2010 DOJ suit in court, which  would allow for surcharging between various card products.

Wal-Mart said the $7.25 billion settlement would not change a “broken” system of what credit card companies charge retailers for processing credit and debit card payments, known as “swipe fees.” “The proposed settlement would not structurally change the broken market or prohibit credit card networks from continually increasing hidden swipe fees, which already cost consumers tens of billions of dollars each year,” the company said in a statement. The class-action settlement between retailers and the two biggest credit card companies, which is subject to court approval, is intended to resolve stores’ claims that Visa and MasterCard conspired with major banks to fix swipe fees. The settlement involves a payment to a class of stores of $6 billion from Visa, MasterCard and more than a dozen of the country’s largest banks who issue the companies’ cards. The card companies also agreed to reduce swipe fees for eight months, for a total consideration to stores valued at about $1.2 billion. In addition, the deal would allow stores to start charging so-called checkout fees to customers who pay with MasterCard or Visa credit and debit cards. Wal-Mart said the settlement would constrain innovation in payments and force retailers to broadly waive their rights to take action against the credit card networks for “detrimental conduct or acts.” Among those that have come out against the settlement, reached earlier this month, are the National Association of Convenience Stores and Wal-Mart rival Target Corp (TGT.N).

90,V,Visa adjusted profit beats as card payments grow,"(Reuters) - Visa Inc’s (V.N) adjusted profit topped Wall Street estimates, and it raised its full-year earnings forecast for the second time this year, as more people move to card-based payments globally. Visa, the world’s largest credit- and debit-card network, also indicated it was not seeing signs of a slowdown, even as global economic growth falters on fears of a worsening European debt crisis. “Although there appear to be darkening economic clouds, our global revenue drivers remain healthy with no clear signals of a downturn at this point in time,” Chief Financial Officer Byron Pollitt said on a post-earnings conference call. Card rival American Express indicated slowing spending growth when it reported results last week. Visa now expects adjusted per-share earnings growth for fiscal 2012 in the low twenties. It had previously forecast earnings growth in the range of high teens to low twenties. Payment volumes grew 6 percent in the quarter. The San Francisco-based company posted an adjusted profit of $1.56 per share for the third quarter. Total operating revenue rose 11 percent to $2.57 billion. Analysts on average expected the company to earn $1.45 per share, excluding items, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Despite the adjusted earnings beat, the company posted a net loss of $1.8 billion, or $2.74 per Class A share, as it set aside $4.1 billion to cover ‘swipe-fee’ litigation costs. Visa, along with rival Mastercard Inc (MA.N) and banks that issue their credit cards, agreed to a $7.25 billion settlement with U.S. retailers in a lawsuit over the fixing of debit and credit card fees. Visa’s share of the settlement is $4.4 billion. Last week, it added $150 million to its legal reserves. “We are pleased that we were able to come to a resolution in the merchant litigation which was acceptable to most parties while ensuring the long-term health of the U.S. payments industry,” CEO Joseph Saunders said in a statement. The anti-trust settlement will also allow stores to start charging customers extra for using certain credit cards in an effort to steer them toward cheaper forms of payment. Visa said it does not see surcharging as something that will significantly affect it. The company also authorized a new $1 billion class A share repurchase program. The program is slated to run through July 2013. Shares of the company were up 1 percent at $124.10 in trading after the bell. They closed at $122.20 on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

Visa, along with rival Mastercard Inc and banks that issue their credit cards, agreed to a $7.25 billion settlement with U.S. retailers in a lawsuit over the fixing of debit and credit card fees. Visa’s share of the settlement is $4.4 billion. Last week, it added $150 million to its legal reserves. “We are pleased that we were able to come to a resolution in the merchant litigation which was acceptable to most parties while ensuring the long-term health of the U.S. payments industry,” CEO Joseph Saunders said in a statement. The anti-trust settlement will also allow stores to start charging customers extra for using certain credit cards in an effort to steer them toward cheaper forms of payment. Visa said it does not see surcharging as something that will significantly affect it. The company also authorized a new $1 billion class A share repurchase program. The program is slated to run through July 2013. Shares of the company were up 1 percent at $124.10 in trading after the bell.

Visa’s credit and debit cards make up about 41 percent of all payment cards issued in Europe, making it the largest card network in the region.

96,V,Retailers press forward on $7.2 billion card fee settlement,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyers for U.S. retailers said on Thursday they expect to submit a proposed $7.2 billion antitrust settlement with Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc for court approval within the next several months, despite opposition to the pact from some large merchants. The plaintiffs do not expect to make any changes to the proposed settlement when it is submitted for preliminary approval by an October 19 deadline, said co-lead counsel Craig Wildfang following a hearing in Brooklyn federal court. “We’re going as fast as we can - not as fast as we’d like, but we’re making progress,” he told U.S. Magistrate Judge James Orenstein during the hearing, referring to supporting documents for the settlement. The settlement would be the largest antitrust settlement in U.S. history. It would resolve a seven-year-old lawsuit accusing the two credit card companies of conspiring with major banks to artificially inflate interchange fees, the amount paid to process electronic transactions involving credit and debit cards. The settlement requires approval by U.S. District Judge John Gleeson, who oversaw retailers’ previous $3 billion swipe-fee settlement with Visa and Mastercard in 2003. As part of the new pact, the credit card companies have offered to pay $6 billion and temporarily reduce interchange fees, also known as swipe fees, to save stores approximately $1.2 billion over an eight-month period, according to court papers. Despite support from Visa and Mastercard, which would pay the bulk of the $6 billion, the settlement has received a frosty reception from several trade associations and some big retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Target Corp. The National Association of Convenience Stores publicly rejected the settlement, and trade groups representing grocers and pharmacies, among others, have since voiced objections. The settlement would allow stores to charge customers extra if they pay with credit cards, although that ability would be limited by state law and stores’ agreements with other card companies, such as American Express Co, according to court papers. The settlement would also give merchants the right to negotiate collectively over swipe fees, and includes broad releases shielding Visa and Mastercard from future litigation over similar swipe-fee issues, court papers showed. The objectors have said the settlement does not offer meaningful reforms to swipe-fee structures. Some merchants have said they either will not or cannot impose credit card surcharges on customer payments, and others have objected to the releases barring future swipe fee suits. If enough stores opt out of the proposal — representing at least 25 percent of annual U.S. retail volume collectively —Visa and Mastercard have the option to withdraw from the deal, according to court papers. Several of the main objectors are being represented by lawyer Jeffrey Shinder. His law firm, Constantine Cannon, served as lead counsel on the 2003 settlement with Visa and Mastercard, although Constantine Cannon is not among the three firms designated as lead counsel for the current litigation. Objections will likely be taken up with the court after the settlement is formally submitted for approval, according to Shinder. “There are fundamental problems with this deal that the court absolutely needs to address before it gives its preliminary approval,” he said after the hearing. Wal-Mart and Target did not immediately have additional comment beyond their earlier concerns about the settlement, according to spokespeople for both companies.

101,V,Visa hires JPMorgan's Charles Scharf as CEO,"(Reuters) - Visa Inc said Charles Scharf, a former head of JPMorgan Chase & Co’s retail financial services division, will succeed Joseph Saunders as chief executive, effective November 1. Visa’s board had been looking for a successor to Saunders, 66, who has headed the company since 2007 and was expected to retire soon. Scharf, 47, previously served on Visa’s board from 2007 to January 2011. Known as Charlie, Scharf was moved from JPMorgan’s retail banking business to its private equity arm in 2011, after the lender shuffled several retail banking executives in a push to raise profit. Scharf worked closely with Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan, when the two men were at Citigroup Inc in the 1990s. Scharf followed Dimon to Chicago-based Bank One, which was bought by JPMorgan in 2004. Scharf is currently managing director at One Equity Partners, which manages $10 billion of investments and commitments for JPMorgan Chase. “We believe Scharf’s large-scale management experience is a good fit ... and our initial checks have been positive regarding his leadership style,” Jefferies analyst Jason Kupferberg wrote in a note to clients. Scharf’s experience with JPMorgan will also help Visa. The bank is Visa’s largest card issuer and accounts for about 10 percent of its profit, Kupferberg noted. Scharf joins at a time that Visa, competitor MasterCard Inc, and card-issuing banks are trying to chart their courses through a storm of new digital technologies and companies that have come to the payments industry from outside of banking, such as eBay Inc’s PayPal and Square Inc. Analysts do not expect Scharf to spark major changes at the payment network. “I think Visa is doing well. I think all he is going to be charged with is moving it forward in the same direction,” Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria said. The San Francisco-based company has already raised its full-year earnings forecast twice this year, as more people move to card-based payments globally. Visa is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on October 31. Current CEO Saunders spearheaded Visa’s 2008 initial public offering and will continue as executive chairman until March 31, after which Visa will appoint a new non-executive independent chairman. Visa said Scharf would receive $950,000 per year in base salary and a bonus of up to 500 percent. Scharf will also get a “make-whole” award of restricted stock and options worth $19 million, the company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The award is based in part of compensation Scharf is leaving behind at JPMorgan. Saunders received $11.8 million in total pay in 2011, according to regulatory filings. Shares of the credit and debit-card network were up less than 1 percent at $137.48 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday afternoon.

109,V,Hundreds of U.S. retailers balk at $7.2 billion card-fee pact,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nearly 1,200 retailers said on Thursday they will urge a federal judge to reject a proposed $7.2 billion settlement between merchants and Visa Inc (V.N) and Mastercard Inc (MA.N) over credit card fees, calling it an “unacceptable” proposal that would strip away stores’ legal rights. The proposed settlement was submitted in October for preliminary approval by the court. If it receives first preliminary and then final approval, it would be the largest federal antitrust settlement in U.S. history, offering nearly 8 million merchants $7.2 billion in cash and temporary reductions in the interchange, or swipe fees, that stores pay to process credit and debit transactions. Since it was first announced in July, the settlement has drawn a vocal chorus of opponents, including 10 of the 19 retailers and trade groups appointed to lead the litigation on merchants’ behalf. Those opponents - which include the National Association of Convenience Stores and the National Restaurant Association - delivered a brief Thursday that asks U.S. District Judge John Gleeson to reject the proposal. Nearly 1,200 other merchants said in court filings that they were unhappy with the deal and would submit multiple briefs expressing their dissatisfaction. They range from some of the best-known U.S. retailers, such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Ikea, to small businesses and major trade groups like the National Retail Federation. “The declarations from about 1,200 merchants, small and large, from every corner of the country, and every type of merchant speak volumes about the fact that something is very seriously wrong with this deal,” said Jeff Shinder, a lawyer representing the named plaintiffs opposing the deal. Opponents said the settlement offers no meaningful reform to swipe-fee rates. They have also blasted litigation releases that would shield Visa and Mastercard from new lawsuits over swipe fees. “Fundamentally, these merchants and their representatives object to the settlement because it will neither introduce transparency nor give merchants the ability to inject competition in a market that has not functioned competitively for decades,” objecting plaintiffs wrote in a court filing. “And the release, given its scope, will make the competitive problems in the marketplace worse for merchants, not better.” Visa, Mastercard and lawyers for stores that support the settlement have said they are confident the court will approve the deal. Trish Wexler, a spokeswoman for the Electronic Payments Coalition, a trade group representing Visa and Mastercard, has called the objections a transparent political ploy by some merchants to force congressional action limiting swipe fees for credit card payments. In a brief order last week, Gleeson said that “at first blush” the proposal meets the legal threshold for preliminary approval, but he noted that the standard will be more stringent for final approval.

110,V,"Visa, MasterCard profits rise with card use","(Reuters) - Increased consumer spending and card use worldwide drove quarterly profits higher for Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N), according to new financial reports from the two payments companies. Visa, which operates the biggest network for credit and debit cards, said that payments, adjusted for changes in currency exchange rates, grew 6 percent in the three months through September from a year earlier and maintained the pace from the prior three months. MasterCard, which has the second-biggest network, said its purchase volume grew 12 percent in the latest three months from a year earlier. Both companies said growth in their businesses outside of the United States led the increases in payment volumes. Visa’s gains were led by growth in its Asia and Pacific operations and MasterCard, too, showed big gains in its Asia, Pacific, Middle East and Africa segments. Both companies are trying to capture new business from increasing consumer preferences for cards and digital payments instead of cash. At the same time, they are also experimenting with mobile payments systems partly out of fear of losing business to upstart technology companies. Visa said profit, in what was its fiscal fourth quarter, rose to $1.7 billion from $880 million a year earlier. But that increase included an unusual boost of $627 million from reversing previously recorded reserves against having to pay additional taxes. Excluding the one-time gain, Visa earned $1.0 billion, or $1.54 per share, in the quarter. Analysts on average had expected the company to earn $1.50 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Visa also announced on Wednesday that its directors have authorized a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program, bringing to $2.3 billion the amount executives may spend to buy back stock for the company. Buybacks have been an important source of growth in earnings per share for the company. Visa said it expects annual net revenue growth in the low double digits and adjusted earnings per share growth in the high teens in percentage terms for its new fiscal year. “Visa delivered strong financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year, a result of our focus on growing our core business, accelerating expansion of our business outside the U.S.,” outgoing Chief Executive Joseph Saunders said. The company said last week that Charles Scharf, a former head of JPMorgan Chase & Co’s (JPM.N) retail financial services division, will succeed Saunders, effective November 1. Like Visa, MasterCard benefited from strong growth overseas. MasterCard’s third-quarter net income rose 8 percent to $772 million, or $6.17 per share, from $717 million, or $5.63 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of $5.92 per share, excluding one-time items, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. MasterCard revenue rose 5 percent to $1.92 billion, but fell short of the $1.94 billion analysts had expected. MasterCard continues to expect second-half revenue growth to be lower than the levels it saw in the second quarter due to the timing of deals and global economic uncertainty, Chief Financial Officer Martina Hund-Mejean said on a conference call with analysts. MasterCard has been boosting its presence outside the United States, cashing in on higher-growth markets in Asia and the Nordic countries. “We think we can double our market share in the Nordic and Baltic regions for the next three years, further extending our presence in these markets that are actually doing relatively well,” Chief Executive Ajay Banga said on the conference call. In India, MasterCard signed deals with travel company Thomas Cook (THOM.NS) to provide foreign exchange prepaid cards, and with ICICI Bank (ICBK.NS) and Western Union Co (WU.N), for a reloadable prepaid card. Customers of the two companies are chiefly banks that issue cards to consumers and make deals with merchants to accept cards for payments. Shares of MasterCard, which is based in Purchase, New York, and has a market value of $56 billion, were up 1.8 percent at $460.93 at the close of New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. Shares of Visa, which is based in Foster City, California, and has a market value of $112 billion, rose as much as 1.6 percent to $141 in trading following the company’s report after normal market hours. Year-to-date, Visa shares were up 37 percent and MasterCard shares 24 percent late on Wednesday.

112,V,UPDATE 3-US retail credit card fee settlement gets preliminary OK,"By Jessica Dye Nov 9 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday granted preliminary approval to a proposed $7.2 billion settlement between merchants and Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc over credit card fees, despite objections from hundreds of retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. If the deal receives final approval from U.S. District Court Judge John Gleeson of Brooklyn, New York, it would be the largest federal antitrust settlement in U.S. history, offering nearly 8 million merchants $7.2 billion in cash and temporary reductions in the interchange, or swipe fees, they pay to process credit and debit transactions. Visa and Mastercard agreed to amend their no-surcharge policies within 60 days of preliminary approval of the deal, allowing merchants to charge customers extra for paying by credit or debit, although that will be restricted by state law. The stores that take Visa and Mastercard will be provisionally certified for settlement purposes and notified of their legal rights. Full terms of the deal will not take effect unless Gleeson gives final approval, which Visa and Mastercard say they believe will occur. The judge will hold a hearing to give objectors a chance to weigh in before then, although no date has yet been set. The $1.2 billion in temporary swipe-fee relief will take effect shortly after class members have been given an opportunity to opt out of receiving the monetary damages, even if the deal never receives final approval, according to settlement papers. During a packed hearing on Friday, lawyers for dozens of objectors — including Target Corp and Home Depot Inc  — told the judge that the settlement offered meaningless relief for merchants saddled with an estimated $30 billion in annual swipe fees. They also argued that releases shielding Visa and Mastercard from new litigation over the same claims would violate their legal rights and give the two companies protection from for any future anti-competitive behavior. No opt-out mechanism is provided for the no-surcharge rules or litigation releases. Lawyers for several dozen stores that support the pact — which include major grocery chains Kroger Co and Safeway Inc — told Gleeson that these concerns were based on “misinformation.” “It’s a lot of smoke and there’s very little fire,” said Richard Arnold, who represents some of the objectors. Gleeson called the initial objections “overstated” but noted that the legal standard for final approval would be much higher. Gleeson has yet to schedule a hearing on final approval. “I don’t mean to suggest there aren’t a number of issues that are going to require significant scrutiny,” he said. Gleeson said he was considering whether to appoint an independent expert to help him understand the economic impact of the changes to Visa and Mastercard’s no-surcharge rules. Visa general counsel Josh Floum said the company looked forward to bringing “closure” to the case, after seven years of litigation, including two years of settlement talks. “While we recognize some merchants may have different opinions, the settlement represents a solution reached after years of litigation and months of negotiation,” said Mastercard general counsel Noah Hanft. Objecting merchants said they were prepared to keep fighting. “This is the beginning of a long process, and we’re not remotely deterred by what happened today,” said Jeff Shinder, a lawyer for 10 of the 19 original plaintiffs who have rejected the settlement. Mallory Duncan, general counsel for the National Retail Federation, one of the largest U.S. trade associations for retailers, said it was considering its legal options. “This proposal benefits no one but lawyers and credit card companies, and should not be forced on the retail industry or retailers’ customers,” he said.",11092012,http://www.reuters.com/article/creditcard-settlement/update-3-us-retail-credit-card-fee-settlement-gets-preliminary-ok-idUSL1E8M99FQ20121109

116,V,FTC asks Visa for information on debit card service,"(Reuters) - The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has asked Visa Inc to provide information on a debit card service that may have violated regulations related to the Dodd-Frank Act, the company said. The FTC’s Bureau of Competition requested the company to provide information regarding violations of the Durbin amendment, Visa said in its annual 10-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday, The Durbin amendment, a part of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, lowered swipe fees that are charged by merchants every time a consumer makes a purchase using a debit card. The voluntary access letter was issued by the FTC on September 21 and the request focuses on information “related to the purposes, implementation, and impact of the optional PIN Debit Gateway Service”, Visa said in the filing. However, the revenue generated by the service is not material to the company’s financial statements, Visa said. The company disclosed in a May regulatory filing that the U.S. Department of Justice had asked for documents and information about its response to a new law and rules limiting debit card fees. Visa introduced a new fee structure in April called Fixed Acquirer Network Fee to push more transactions to its network that is likely to hurt other card processors.

118,V,Cold weather heats up sales at John Lewis,"LONDON, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Recent cold weather in Britain has boosted sales of warm clothes at John Lewis department stores over the past week, helping the chain to its third-busiest sales week on record. John Lewis said on Sunday store sales for the previous week hit 124.2 million pounds ($200 million) and the company saw its busiest week ever for online sales, which hit 37.9 million pounds. The partnership said in an emailed statement the recent cold weather in Britain had boosted sales of outerwear and knitwear as well products that enable people to use technology devices without getting cold. John Lewis said hearmuffs, which allow users to listen to music while protecting their ears from the elements, have been particularly popular. “As well as buying gifts and getting their homes ready for the festive period, customers are ensuring they keep warm with cold-weather clothing and heaters selling fast,” said Maggie Porteous, head of selling operations at John Lewis. John Lewis, which has an annual turnover of nearly 8.7 billion pounds, also said on Sunday sales were boosted last week by customers preparing for the party season with sales of high heels, beauty products and jewellery up 8.2 percent. The partnership said last month it expected an “online shopping frenzy” on Dec. 3 which would break all records. Analysis of Visa Europe data shows the busiest online shopping day historically falls on the Monday closest to the start of December. Visa said it expected shoppers to spend about 320 million pounds with Visa cards alone on Monday. “On Mega Monday, people across the United Kingdom will go online and use their Visa cards to make 6.8 million transactions, the most in a single day in U.K. history,” said Steve Perry, a commercial director at Visa Europe.",12022012,http://www.reuters.com/article/johnlewis-sales/cold-weather-heats-up-sales-at-john-lewis-idUSL5E8N255E20121202

121,V,U.S. regional banks see loan growth in 2013,"(Reuters) - U.S. regional banks PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB.O) and BB&T; Corp (BBT.N) expect their commercial and industrial loan portfolios to grow in 2013, even as competition heats up in the sector. Commercial and industrial lending is one of the few bright spots for banks as they deal with lackluster demand for credit. Lenders are trying to outbid each other by lowering rates and sometimes extending loan terms to win business. PNC’s total commercial lending rose $3.7 billion after a weak third quarter, despite the bank saying it would pass on making some loans because the returns would be too low. PNC Chief Executive Jim Rohr said at an investor conference last month that banks were competing on price and tenure, making some loans an unattractive proposition for the bank. Rohr said Ohio — a state where PNC competes with Fifth Third — had some irrational prices. Cincinnati-based Fifth Third’s commercial and industrial loan growth also picked up pace after two quarters of muted credit growth. It expects average loans to increase in the mid-to-high single-digit range in 2013. However, loan growth may be harder to achieve in the next two quarters as businesses remain concerned about the debt ceiling and spending cuts. Midwestern lender Huntington Bancorp (HBAN.O) expects most of the growth in its C&I; portfolio after the U.S. Congress resolves the debt ceiling issue. Large U.S. banks have submitted their capital plans to the Federal Reserve for the 2013 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). The results of the review will determine whether the banks can raise their dividends and buy back stock. PNC CEO Rohr said it was unlikely that the bank would be allowed to buy back shares because 2013 would be a capital building year for the lender. Fifth Third’s capital plan included potential dividend increases and buybacks, Chief Executive Kevin Kabat said on a post earnings call on Thursday. BB&T; CFO Daryl Bible said a dividend increase was part of the bank’s 2013 capital objectives, along with the ability to acquire other lenders. Buying back stock came in fourth on the southeastern U.S. bank’s list of capital priorities. Pittsburgh-based PNC said net income rose to $719 million, or $1.24 per share, in the quarter ended December 31, from $493 million, or 85 cents per share, a year earlier. PNC, one of the top 10 lenders in the United States, earned $254 million in mortgage banking fees, as Americans continued to refinance home loans to take advantage of low interest rates. It set aside the same amount to cover loan repurchase requests from government-backed mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Fifth Third posted a higher quarterly profit on gains from its share sale in payment processor Vantiv Inc VNTV.N. It reported net income of $390 million, or 43 cents per share, for the quarter, above analysts’ estimates of 41 cents per share. BB&T; also got a boost from mortgage banking revenue, helping it beat analysts’ estimates. PNC shares were up 3 percent at $61.76, while those of BB&T; were 2 percent higher at $30.96 on the New York Stock Exchange. Huntington Bancshares shares were up about 3 percent at $6.90, and Fifth Third shares, which rose to a four-year high earlier in the day, were up 3 percent at $16.07 on the Nasdaq.

Cincinnati-based Fifth Third’s commercial and industrial loan growth also picked up pace after two quarters of muted credit growth. It expects average loans to increase in the mid-to-high single-digit range in 2013. However, loan growth may be harder to achieve in the next two quarters as businesses remain concerned about the debt ceiling and spending cuts. Midwestern lender Huntington Bancorp expects most of the growth in its C&I; portfolio after the U.S. Congress resolves the debt ceiling issue. Large U.S. banks have submitted their capital plans to the Federal Reserve for the 2013 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). The results of the review will determine whether the banks can raise their dividends and buy back stock. PNC CEO Rohr said it was unlikely that the bank would be allowed to buy back shares because 2013 would be a capital building year for the lender. Fifth Third’s capital plan included potential dividend increases and buybacks, Chief Executive Kevin Kabat said on a post earnings call on Thursday. BB&T; CFO Daryl Bible said a dividend increase was part of the bank’s 2013 capital objectives, along with the ability to acquire other lenders. Buying back stock came in fourth on the southeastern U.S. bank’s list of capital priorities. Pittsburgh-based PNC said net income rose to $719 million, or $1.24 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $493 million, or 85 cents per share, a year earlier. PNC, one of the top 10 lenders in the United States, earned $254 million in mortgage banking fees, as Americans continued to refinance home loans to take advantage of low interest rates. It set aside the same amount to cover loan repurchase requests from government-backed mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Fifth Third posted a higher quarterly profit on gains from its share sale in payment processor Vantiv Inc. It reported net income of $390 million, or 43 cents per share, for the quarter, above analysts’ estimates of 41 cents per share. BB&T; also got a boost from mortgage banking revenue, helping it beat analysts’ estimates. PNC shares were up 3 percent at $61.76, while those of BB&T; were 2 percent higher at $30.96 on the New York Stock Exchange. Huntington Bancshares shares were up about 3 percent at $6.90, and Fifth Third shares, which rose to a four-year high earlier in the day, were up 3 percent at $16.07 on the Nasdaq.",1172013,http://www.reuters.com/article/pncfinancial-results/update-2-u-s-regional-banks-see-loan-growth-in-2013-idUSL4N0AM76U20130117
123,V,Visa profit beats as card payments accelerate,"(Reuters) - Visa Inc’s (V.N) quarterly profit beat analysts’ estimates for the ninth consecutive quarter as credit, debit and transactions grew at the world’s largest payments network. Visa, along with its closest rival MasterCard Inc (MA.N), have been working to spread card and online payments in parts of the world dominated by cash transactions. Visa’s purchase volumes grew 9 percent to $1.1 trillion in the first quarter, the fastest rate of growth in nine months. Billable transactions on the company’s Cybersource online payments network jumped 28 percent, the quickest pace in at least five quarters. Visa has also been expanding in emerging markets. The company will provide payment services under a biometric identification program being implemented by the Indian government. The Foster City, California-based company, which is boosting its electronic payment operations and rolling out its digital wallet service, V.me, said it would continue to invest in new services. “The work on mobile here continues, both organically and with the acquisition of Fundamo. It’s a critical access point to our network and continued investment in that is absolutely critical for us,” Chief Executive Charlie Scharf said on a post-earnings conference call. Visa acquired South Africa-based Fundamo, a mobile payments company with a presence in emerging markets, for about $100 million in 2011. Scharf, a former head of JPMorgan Chase & Co’s (JPM.N) retail financial services division, took over as chief executive of Visa in November. Visa’s profit rose 30 percent in the first quarter, boosted by payment volumes and a tax benefit. The company’s profit rose to $1.3 billion, or $1.93 per Class A share, from $1.0 billion, or $1.49 per Class A share, a year earlier. Visa reported an adjusted profit of $1.82 per share, topping analysts’ average estimate of $1.79 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total operating revenue rose 12 percent to $2.80 billion. MasterCard reported better-than-expected results last week on strong growth in emerging markets. It also doubled its quarterly cash dividend on Tuesday and said it would buy back up to $2 billion of its Class A shares. Visa said it expected percentage growth in full-year 2013 net revenue to be in the low double-digits and adjusted Class A earnings per share growth in the high-teens. The company forecasts an annual operating margin of about 60 percent. Shares of the company, which has a market valuation of more than $125 billion, closed at $160.82 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

126,V,Judge dismisses ATM fee collusion lawsuits,"(Reuters) - A federal judge has dismissed antitrust lawsuits accusing Visa Inc, MasterCard Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co of conspiring to fix automated teller machine fees. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington, D.C., said that, while the three lawsuits “bristle with indignation,” the plaintiffs failed to show they were injured, or that there was a conspiracy to charge excessive or artificially high fees. “Notwithstanding plaintiffs’ adamant insistence that consumers are being overcharged, the court simply could not find facts to support that contention,” Jackson wrote. The plaintiffs included several individual consumers, 13 owners and operators of independent non-bank ATMs that compete with bank ATMs, as well as the National ATM Council, a trade group for those owners and operators. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Bank of America spokeswoman Shirley Norton and MasterCard spokesman James Issokson said their companies are pleased with the decision. Visa spokesman Will Valentine, JPMorgan spokesman Thomas Kelly and Wells Fargo spokesman Ancel Martinez declined to comment. Visa and MasterCard are the world’s largest payment networks. JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo are the largest, second-largest and fourth-largest U.S. banks by assets. In September, financial research firm Bankrate.com said the cost of using out-of-network ATMs rose 4 percent in the prior year to a record $2.50. It also said people who use such ATMs paid their own banks an average $1.57 fee, up 11 percent. The lawsuits filed in October 2011 accused Visa and MasterCard of setting rules that barred ATM operators from offering lower prices on independent PIN debit card networks that were not affiliated with either company. These networks comprise 200,000 ATMs nationwide, many of which are found in such places as convenience stores and gas stations, court papers show. The plaintiffs said the alleged illegal agreements required operators of ATMs that accepted Visa- or MasterCard-branded cards to charge consumers no more for using those cards than they charged consumers who transact on other ATM networks. Visa and MasterCard said this helped consumers by setting a ceiling on ATM access fees. The plaintiffs countered it established a floor beneath which fees for transactions processed on other networks could not be discounted. In finding no conspiracy among Visa, MasterCard and the banks to restrain trade, Jackson said that “at most, plaintiffs allege that ATM operators - both banks and independent operators - make independent business decisions whether to participate in the Visa and MasterCard networks.” The cases, all in the U.S. District Court, District of Columbia, are National ATM Council Inc et al v. Visa Inc et al, No. 11-01803; Mackmin et al v. Visa Inc et al, No. 11-01831; and Stoumbos v. Visa Inc et al, No. 11-01882.

129,V,"Visa CEO calls digital wallet fee on PayPal ""appropriate""","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Visa Inc Chief Executive Charlie Scharf suggested on Wednesday that the payment network may impose a fee on digital wallet operators like PayPal, following rival MasterCard Inc. MasterCard said earlier this year that it plans a new fee for digital wallet operators starting in June. PayPal is not an official payment network in its own right. Instead, when people use PayPal to pay for something, the purchases are funded from their bank account or their credit and debit cards. Because of this, PayPal already pays huge amounts of fees to Visa, MasterCard and American Express whenever a PayPal purchase is funded with a credit card bearing those logos. Shares of eBay Inc, owner of PayPal, the largest digital wallet operator, have been hit hard on concerns other payment networks may roll out similar fees, cutting into PayPal’s profitability. “I think it is totally appropriate to do that,” Scharf said during the Barclays Emerging Payments Forum on Wednesday, when asked if Visa was planning a digital wallet fee. Digital wallets are electronic versions of real wallets that store card and bank information and can be used to buy things online quickly and anonymously. These digital wallets are increasingly moving into the physical world, through consumers’ use of smartphones while shopping in retail stores. PayPal is moving from its online roots into the physical retailer world, where the vast majority of payments still take place. It is a big opportunity for the business, and that has driven eBay shares higher in the past year. However, as a payment option in lots of physical stores, PayPal will be a bigger threat to networks like MasterCard, Visa and American Express, analysts say. “Some of the people we compete with started out as one thing and they morph into another thing, and doing things online is very different than doing things at point of sale,” Scharf said on Wednesday. “We are always thinking about those relationships and they have changed,” he added. “And if they changed enough that we think it warrants us to change something with us, we will do that.” A Visa spokesman declined to comment on Wednesday. The MasterCard fee will be charged on “staged” digital wallets, such as PayPal, Google’s Wallet, Square, iZettle in Europe and Intuit Inc’s GoPayment, according to analysts. Staged digital wallets typically share less information with card issuers and the networks, creating customer service problems and making it more difficult to deal with card rewards programs, analysts say. “Allowing data to be passed through to our issuers and then not allowing data to be passed through to our issuers makes us re-think about our pricing and our rules,” Scharf said on Wednesday. Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said it is “inevitable” that Visa will follow MasterCard’s move and introduce a digital wallet fee of its own. “This is a fully functioning duopoly. When one does something, the other one follows suit,” Luria explained. “It was MasterCard’s turn to exercise its market power. If they are allowed to do it then Visa will follow.” ",3202013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-visa-paypal/visa-ceo-calls-digital-wallet-fee-on-paypal-appropriate-idUSBRE92J1CU20130320

The comment came amid concern Visa might follow MasterCard Inc’s recent move to impose a new fee on operators of digital wallets, such as PayPal, owned by eBay Inc. During a Barclays investor conference on Wednesday Visa Chief Executive Charlie Scharf said that the payment network’s relationship with digital wallet operators is changing as they move more into physical stores.

134,V,Retail trade group to opt out of $7.2 billion credit card-fee pact,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A major retail trade association said Wednesday it will reject a proposed $7.2 billion settlement with credit-card giants Visa Inc (V.N) and Mastercard Inc (MA.N) over card fees, calling it a “bad deal” for nearly 8 million U.S. merchants. The Retail Industry Leaders Association, or RILA, said it intends to “make a statement” by opting out of the potentially historic settlement just as lead lawyers for the plaintiffs and credit-card companies are preparing to file papers seeking final approval from a federal judge in Brooklyn , N.Y. RILA represents some of the largest U.S. retailers, including Walmart Stores Inc. (WMT.N), Target Corp. (TGT.N) and Home Depot Inc, all of which have previously expressed dissatisfaction with the proposed settlement. The move could prompt a new round of criticism of the deal from large U.S. retailers and possibly more opt outs. The credit card companies believe they have a judge’s backing in the settlement, but a high number of opt-outs could imperil the hard-fought pact. The proposed settlement, announced last year, would resolve an eight-year old lawsuit on behalf of U.S. merchants accusing Visa and Mastercard of artificially raising interchange, or swipe, fees, which are paid to process credit-card transactions. The settlement includes a $6.05 billion payment and $1.2 billion in temporary swipe-fee reductions, as well as changes to Visa and Mastercard rules to allow merchants to charge customers extra for using certain cards. U.S. District Judge John Gleeson has already given preliminary approval to the proposal, potentially the largest private antitrust settlement in U.S. history. Nearly 8 million stores, restaurants and other merchants that accept credit cards have been given until May 28 to opt out or object to the deal. If merchants opt out, they will not be eligible to receive a portion of the monetary damages. However, they will also not be bound by parts of the settlement that would prohibit them from suing Visa and Mastercard over similar interchange issues in the future, and could potentially bring their own lawsuits. RILA general counsel Deborah White said that the group is opting out of the settlement on its own behalf, and that each of its members will have to decide individually whether to object, opt out or stay in the litigation. “We do have the support from a large majority of our membership for opting out and objecting, and we want to make sure we’re shedding light on what the true ramifications are for the proposed settlement,” White said in an interview. The group believes that the litigation releases in the settlement will force merchants to forego future legal claims against Visa and Mastercard in exchange for “paltry” monetary relief over years of harm from swipe fees, which have cost merchants billions of dollars, White said. RILA is among the first major trade groups to come out swinging against the deal, which drew a flurry of opposition at the preliminary approval stage last year. The National Grocers Association said in February that it would opt out, and urged its members to do the same. Visa, Mastercard and a lawyer for lead plaintiffs supporting the settlement did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday evening.

The Retail Industry Leaders Association, or RILA, said it intends to “make a statement” by opting out of the potentially historic settlement just as lead lawyers for the plaintiffs and credit-card companies are preparing to file papers seeking final approval from a federal judge in Brooklyn, N.Y. RILA represents some of the largest U.S. retailers, including Walmart Stores Inc, Target Corp and Home Depot Inc, all of which have previously expressed dissatisfaction with the proposed settlement. The move could prompt a new round of criticism of the deal from large U.S. retailers and possibly more opt-outs. The credit card companies believe they have a judge’s backing in the settlement, but a high number of opt-outs could imperil the hard-fought pact. The proposed settlement, announced last year, would resolve an eight-year old lawsuit on behalf of U.S. merchants accusing Visa and Mastercard of artificially raising interchange, or swipe, fees, which are paid to process credit-card transactions. The settlement includes a $6.05 billion payment and $1.2 billion in temporary swipe-fee reductions, as well as changes to Visa and Mastercard rules to allow merchants to charge customers extra for using certain cards. U.S. District Judge John Gleeson has already given preliminary approval to the proposal, potentially the largest private antitrust settlement in U.S. history. Nearly 8 million stores, restaurants and other merchants that accept credit cards have been given until May 28 to opt out or object to the deal. If merchants opt out, they will not be eligible to receive a portion of the monetary damages. But they note that they will be bound by parts of the settlement that would prohibit them from suing Visa and Mastercard over similar interchange issues in the future, if the settlement is approved. RILA general counsel Deborah White said that the group is opting out of the settlement on its own behalf, and that each of its members will have to decide individually whether to object, opt out, or stay in the litigation. “We do have the support from a large majority of our membership for opting out and objecting, and we want to make sure we’re shedding light on what the true ramifications are for the proposed settlement,” White said in an interview. The group believes that the litigation releases in the settlement will force merchants to forego future legal claims against Visa and Mastercard in exchange for “paltry” monetary relief over years of harm from swipe fees, which have cost merchants billions of dollars, White said. RILA is among the first major trade groups to come out swinging against the deal, which drew a flurry of opposition at the preliminary approval stage last year.  The National Grocers Association said in February that it would opt out, and urged its members to do the same. Visa, Mastercard and a lawyer for lead plaintiffs supporting the settlement did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday evening. Trish Wexler, a spokeswoman for the Electronic Payments Coalition, which represents the payment card industry, said she remained “highly confident that this (settlement) will be approved, and that the interchange fee battle will finally come to an end.” A hearing on final approval is set for September.

142,V,Consumer credit posts smallest gain in eight months,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Consumer credit recorded its smallest increase in eight months in March, a possible hint that Americans are still trying to pare their debts. Consumer installment credit rose by $7.97 billion to $2.81 trillion, the Federal Reserve said on Tuesday. It was the smallest increase since July and well below economists’ expectations for a $16 billion rise. For the first quarter, the total flow of credit rose at an annual rate of $157.1 billion, slowing from a $177.7 billion increase in the last three months of 2012. Revolving credit, which mostly measures credit-card use, fell $1.71 billion after rising $453 million in February. Credit from depository institutions fell in March, while advances by financial institutions were unchanged. “One sobering statistic that argues against a rebound in household credit growth in the near future is that student loans have been the driver of any growth in credit to households,” said Julia Coronado, chief North America economist at BNP Paribas. U.S. households built up a massive debt load as the housing bubble expanded. Efforts to pay down those debts have been a restraint on spending and the economy’s recovery. The drop in credit card usage casts doubt on views that household deleveraging is almost over, as recently suggested by other data that had fueled hopes consumers might soon borrow and spend more freely. Nonrevolving credit in March, which includes auto loans and student loans made by the government, rose $9.68 billion in March. That followed an $18.18 billion increase in February. Over the past year, nonrevolving credit from the federal government increased $108 billion, mostly reflecting increased tuition fees. Some economists, however, were little fazed by the drop in revolving credit and said it still appeared household deleveraging had run its course. “While the weaker March reading is disappointing, the relatively steady improvement in consumer credit growth over the past year should remain supportive for future consumer spending,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities in New York. “While there have been concerns that student loans are exclusively been behind the improvement in the credit picture, consumer credit growth ex-student loans remains relatively robust.” ",5072013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-credit/consumer-credit-posts-smallest-gain-in-eight-months-idUSBRE9460UX20130507

Sommers, 44, who previously served as chief executive of the bank’s wealth management business, joined JP Morgan through the Bear Sterns merger in 2008. Sommers was responsible for the company’s Chase Private Client business, which has offices in nearly 1,400 Chase bank branches. JP Morgan is using its private client business to make money from its branches at a time when more and more banking transactions are taking place online. The company’s consumer bank has a network of about 5,600 branches across the United States and generated about $14 billion in revenue. Sommers replaces Ryan McInerney, who has been named by Visa Inc as its president. At Visa, McInerney will report to Chief Executive Charlie Scharf. Scharf also joined the credit card company from JPMorgan, where he headed retail banking operations. Scharf had hired McInerney several years ago to work for him at JPMorgan Chase, McInerney told Reuters. McInerney, 37, will replace John Partridge, who retired on March 31. He will receive an annual salary of $750,000, Visa said in a regulatory filing. JP Morgan is one of the largest issuers of Visa cards. It issued about 69.6 million Visa cards in 2012, according to a Feb. 2013 Nilson report. Cards issued by Chase, including credit, debit and prepaid, account for about 16 percent of spending on Visa cards, according to the report. The companies this year entered a new 10-year renewable partnership agreement under which JP Morgan will launch a payment platform powered by Visa.

The lawsuit seeks to give the card companies legal ammunition against some retailers who are trying to opt out a proposed settlement under which they would receive a share of $7.2 billion in cash and fee discounts from the card companies. The complaint filed Friday in Brooklyn federal court by the credit card giants and a number of banks that issue their cards asks U.S. District Judge John Gleeson to declare that interchange, or swipe, fees are lawful and pro-competitive. On Thursday, Target Corp and other retailers, including JC Penney and Kohl’s, broke away from the pact. The retailers filed a lawsuit in Manhattan federal court against the credit card companies alleging past antitrust violations and seeking damages. The proposed settlement would end eight years of litigation by merchants who accused Visa and Mastercard of inflating swipe fees. Friday’s complaint was brought against retailers and trade groups who were named plaintiffs in the swipe fee litigation, but later opted out. If Gleeson rules that the swipe fees do not violate antitrust law, it could prevent them from pursuing separate damage actions. It could also affect the ability of other retailers who opt out to seek damages over swipe fees. “A declaration in plaintiffs’ favor against the defendants is necessary to prevent the continuation of endless, wasteful litigation between defendants and plaintiffs,” the complaint on Friday said. The motion from the card companies is the latest volley in a fierce legal fight over the settlement, which Gleeson preliminarily approved in November. If granted final approval, it would be the largest private antitrust settlement in U.S. history. On Tuesday, Wal-Mart and 18 other major retailers said they would opt out of receiving damages from the proposed settlement and consider separate legal action. They say the pact offers inadequate compensation for the billions of dollars they pay each year in interchange fees and forces them to sign broad litigation releases that could shield Visa and Mastercard from future lawsuits over antitrust violations.

154,V,WikiLeaks claims victory as credit card donations flow again,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - International credit card donations to WikiLeaks are flowing again after an Icelandic court ruling forced MasterCard’s and Visa’s local agent to process payments, the anti-secrecy organization said on Wednesday. One of WikiLeaks’ most important sources of funding - donations made from Visa and MasterCard users around the globe - was cut off in 2010 when the firms stopped processing donations to WikiLeaks’ only direct credit card payment line, located in Iceland. Their move came after criticism by the United States of the anti-secrecy organization’s release of thousands of sensitive U.S. diplomatic cables, which embarrassed Washington. The online payment service PayPal, also among the firms that suspended WikiLeaks accounts used to collect donations, said at the time it had acted at the behest of the U.S. government, which deemed WikiLeaks’ activities illegal in the United States. “This is in my mind a big victory in the ongoing battle against the financial companies that have attacked us,” WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said by telephone from New York. He declined to say how many new donations had arrived. The companies handling payments also confirmed that credit card lines had been opened. Hrafnsson added that WikiLeaks’ PayPal account remained frozen. DataCell, the Icelandic data hosting provider that deals with WikiLeaks’ payments, announced only this week that donation lines were open after uncertainty, following the Icelandic Supreme Court’s decision in April, that credit card firms had complied. “We have had donations from around the world,” DataCell’s chief executive Andreas Fink told Reuters. Fink said DataCell had been processing about 70,000 euros a day in donations for WikiLeaks just before the blockade. Iceland has been a key location for WikiLeaks due to its record of protecting Internet freedom. WikiLeaks said its donations had plummeted 95 percent after it was cut off by the world’s two largest credit and debit processors, even though it found some workarounds through third parties. DataCell won a Supreme Court ruling against Visa’s and MasterCard’s local partner, Valitor, in April. “We can continue to process donations for WikiLeaks for as long as we like,” said Fink. “There has never been anything illegal. We have done normal business with a normal entity.” WikiLeaks said it had confirmation that MasterCard had decided to reverse its decision to block direct donations to WikiLeaks in Iceland. Visa Europe told Reuters earlier on Wednesday that Valitor would also comply with the court order. The donations are used to pay for WikiLeaks’ servers, salaries and other operational costs. Hrafnsson said on Wednesday that he did not foresee any WikiLeaks funds reaching former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, holed up in a Moscow international airport, whom WikiLeaks is helping to try to obtain asylum. A former director at DataCell said recently he would send a private plane for Snowden, wanted by Washington for espionage after divulging classified details of U.S. phone and Internet surveillance, if Iceland granted him asylum. Legal costs for WikiLeaks’ founder Julian Assange come from a separate fund, Hrafnsson said. Assange, who fled to Ecuador’s embassy in London last year to avoid extradition to Sweden to face rape and sexual assault allegations, has said the financial blockade cost WikiLeaks in excess of $20 million.

158,V,European Commission proposal calls for cap on card transaction fees: FT,"(Reuters) - The European Commission is considering a plan to cut lucrative debit and credit card transaction fees set by companies including Visa and MasterCard, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday. The plan stops short of a full-fledged ban on debit card fees, as had been contemplated in earlier versions, but would still come as a setback to the payments industry, the paper reported after seeing the latest revision of the plan. The European Commission has considered ways to reduce such fees after determining in 2007 that the fees for cards issued in Europe violated competition rules and ultimately raised costs for consumers and merchants. The latest plan proposes a 0.2 percent cap on all consumer debit as well as credit card transactions, the paper said, with the blanket cap set to be introduced after a two-year transition period during which the ceiling would apply only to cross-border fees. A European Commission spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment outside regular business hours. Both MasterCard and Visa Europe, the European licensee of Visa Inc, have already capped their interbank debit and credit card fees at 0.2 percent and 0.3 percent of the value of a transaction, respectively, as part of antitrust deals with the competition regulator. According to Commission estimates, the proposed cap will cut total debit card fees across the European Union to about 2.5 billion euros ($3.28 billion) from about 4.8 billion euros, the FT said on its website. Credit card fees will fall to 3.5 billion euros from 5.7 billion euros once the cap is in place, the financial daily said.

159,V,UPDATE 2-Canadian panel dismisses case against credit card companies,"* Credit card firms can continue to set rules for merchants * Tribunal says regulation is the best way to address issue * Banks to benefit from ruling, analyst says By Cameron French TORONTO, July 23 (Reuters) - Canada’s Competition Tribunal has dismissed a complaint about the rules imposed on merchants by the Canadian arms of MasterCard Inc and Visa Inc , a victory not only for the card companies but for the banks that issue the cards. The decision, released on Tuesday, means credit card providers may continue to prohibit merchants from imposing a surcharge on customers that use credit cards, especially premium cards. The Competition Bureau, an independent enforcement agency, had argued that the credit-card company rules put customers at a disadvantage and suppress competition among card providers, and in 2010 it asked the tribunal to strike them down. Typically, merchants must pay a fee ranging from 1.5 to 3 percent on card purchases, with higher fees charged for premium rewards cards. That compares with a processing fee of about 12 Canadian cents for an Interac debit transaction, the bureau said. Retail groups have estimated these “hidden fees” amount to C$5 billion ($4.86 billion)-C$6 billion a year. The bureau said the fees penalize cash customers because retailers are forced to raise prices for all customers to cover them, instead of raising prices only for card users. In a summary of its decision, the tribunal agreed that the rules have an adverse effect on competition, but said that under its legal interpretation the relevant section of Canada’s Competition Act does not apply. It said the proper way to address the issue would be to change the regulations that cover the transactions. “The tribunal made no award of costs and noted that the (Competition Bureau) commissioner advanced a case which should have been brought, even if the commissioner was not entirely successful,” it said in the summary. In a statement released after the decision, Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said he would call a meeting of representatives of the credit card industry, retailers and consumers to discuss next steps. “I will be carefully reviewing the Competition Tribunal’s decision and also monitoring any potential appeal,” Flaherty said. Competition Bureau Commissioner John Pecman said he was disappointed by the decision and would review it closely to determine the bureau’s next steps. The Retail Council of Canada, which represents 45,000 stores, said that while it was also disappointed by the ruling, it agreed with the tribunal that regulatory changes were the best answer. “Despite today’s ruling, the fact remains - Canadians are paying more than they should be at the register because of these high fees,” spokesman David Wilkes said in a statement. Canada’s credit card market is dominated by Visa and MasterCard, which together control about 90 percent. The cards are issued mainly by banks, which reap hefty fees and interest charges from them, particularly from premium cards,  use of which might have fallen if the tribunal’s decision had gone the other way. “It’s great news for the banks,” said Peter Routledge, an analyst at National Bank of Canada. Shares of the country’s big banks were mixed on Tuesday, with the strongest performer, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce , one of the largest card issuers. The bank ended the session up 0.7 percent at C$78.05 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Routledge said the decision could clear the way for CIBC to make a final decision on whether it wants to maintain its Aeroplan rewards partnership with loyalty program company Aimia . CIBC and Aimia have partnered for two decades on CIBC’s profitable Aerogold flight rewards card. Their agreement expires at the end of the year, and last month rival Toronto-Dominion Bank said it had a deal with Aimia to replace CIBC as the card’s issuer. CIBC has until Aug. 9 to match the terms of the TD deal if it wants to maintain the partnership. A spokeswoman for the bank would not comment on whether the tribunal decision would affect its next move.

161,V,Europe to clamp down on charges for paying with plastic,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Banks will have to limit the fees they charge on card payments under proposals from the European Commission on Wednesday that would also scrap surcharges on shoppers paying with plastic. The draft law would squeeze an important source of income for banks but should bring lower prices for consumers. It will also end the practice of bumping up the cost of airline tickets, for example, when consumers use their credit card to pay. “The interchange fees paid by retailers end up on consumers’ bills,” said Joaquin Almunia, the European Union commissioner in charge of antitrust enforcement, who announced the measures. “Retailers will make big savings by paying lower fees to their banks, and consumers will benefit through lower retail prices,” he said. The Commission estimates that the new curbs could save retailers 6 billion euros ($7.93 billion). The rules are a setback in particular for Visa Europe, the European licensee of Visa Inc. that is owned and operated by roughly 3,000 European banks including all major lenders. MasterCard will also be affected. Visa, Mastercard and bank lobby groups disputed that the new law would benefit consumers. “Experience indeed shows that merchants do not pass fee reductions on to consumers,” said Sebastien de Brouwer at the European Banking Federation. The UK Cards Association, which represents card issuers in Britain, said they might be forced to introduce new fees to cover their operating costs. Visa Inc and MasterCard are defending similar fees in the United States where retailers claim they have inflated such costs. Some cards in Europe, such as branded commercial cards issued, for example, by a retailer will not be covered by the rules. American Express, which operates on a different basis, will also be largely unaffected. At the moment, banks charge a fee when processing payments using cards that can amount to 1.5 percent of the purchase price. Under the draft rules, which the Commission hopes will widen retailers’ acceptance of cards, that charge would be capped at 0.2 percent for debit cards and 0.3 percent on credit cards. Once the European Parliament and EU countries give their blessing for the rules to come into force, companies such as airlines would be unable to impose surcharges, saving consumers 730 million euros ($964.94 million) annually. If lawmakers in Brussels hammer out final details of the rules before European Parliament elections next year, an ambitious goal, the law could be in place in 2015. The new law would mark the end of a two decades-long battle between the EU’s executive, which enforces antitrust rules in the 28-country bloc, and card firms Visa Europe and MasterCard. Visa Europe has already offered to cap inter-bank credit card fees at the level of 0.3 percent, the same benchmark as competitor MasterCard. And while consumer lobby group Beuc welcomed the end of what they called “shameless” surcharges, some retail lobbyists said the draft rules limiting interbank fees did not go far enough. Ruth Milligan of EuroCommerce, a retail lobby group that has campaigned for cuts in the charges, said the fee should reflect the “tiny” actual costs involved. “It should be a fixed fee,” said Milligan. “There is no reason for it to be a percentage fee. Because the electronic system is already in place, it’s a tiny cost, something like 1 cent per transaction.” “There has been a political compromise in the Commission with a lot of pressure from the banking sector and the card schemes,” she said, adding that the levels of the cap had been chosen without input from merchants or consumers. The cap, which is in line with measures demanded by the Commission’s antitrust officials, will apply initially for cross-border transactions - for example, when an Irish card-holder uses the card in France. After almost two years, this limit would be extended to the so-called interchange fees on domestic payments using all cards.

164,V,UPDATE 4-U.S. indicts hackers in biggest cyber fraud case in history,"* Prosecutors say men were associates of Albert Gonzales * Say at least 160 mln credit card numbers stolen * Nasdaq said to be victim of two-year breach * Hackers could delete, change, steal Nasdaq data -prosecutors By David Jones and Jim Finkle NEWARK, N.J./BOSTON, July 25 (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors said on Thursday they have charged five men responsible for a hacking and credit card fraud spree that cost companies more $300 million and two of the suspects are in custody, in the biggest cyber crime case filed in U.S. history. They also disclosed a new security breach against Nasdaq, though they provided few details about the attack. Other companies targeted by the hackers include a Visa Inc  licensee, J.C. Penney Co, JetBlue Airways Corp  and French retailer Carrefour SA, according to an indictment unveiled in New Jersey. Authorities have been pursing the hackers for years. Many of the breaches were previously reported, though it appeared the one involving Nasdaq OMX Group Inc was being disclosed for the first time. Prosecutors said they conservatively estimate that the group of five men from Russia and Ukraine helped steal at least 160 million payment card numbers, resulting in losses in excess of $300 million. Authorities in New Jersey charged that each of the defendants had specialized tasks: Russians Vladimir Drinkman, 32, and Alexandr Kalinin, 26, hacked into networks, while Roman Kotov, 32, mined them for data. They allegedly hid their activities using anonymous web-hosting services provided by Mikhail Rytikov, 26, of Ukraine. Russian Dmitriy Smilianets, 29, is accused of selling the stolen data and distributing the profits. Prosecutors said he charged $10 for U.S. cards, $15 for ones from Canada and $50 for European cards, which are more expensive because they have computer chips that make them more secure. The five hid their efforts by disabling anti-virus software of their victims and storing data on multiple hacking platforms, prosecutors said. They sold payment card numbers to resellers, who then sold them on online forums or to “cashers” who encode the numbers onto blank plastic cards. “This type of crime is the cutting edge,” said New Jersey U.S. Attorney Paul J. Fishman. “Those who have the expertise and the inclination to break into our computer networks threaten our economic wellbeing, our privacy and our national security.” The indictment cited Albert Gonzalez as a co-conspirator. He is already serving 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to helping mastermind one of the biggest hacking fraud schemes in U.S. history, helping steal millions of credit and debit cards. Prosecutors say the defendants worked with Gonzalez before his arrest in Miami, then continued on a crime spree after his capture. Drinkman and Smilianets were arrested in June 2012, while traveling in the Netherlands, at the request of U.S. authorities. Smilianets was extradited last September and is expected to appear in New Jersey Federal court next week. Drinkman is awaiting an extradition hearing in the Netherlands. Prosecutors declined comment on the whereabouts of the other three defendants. Tom Kellermann, a vice president with security software maker Trend Micro, said he thinks the prospects are dim that they will be caught because authorities in some countries turn a blind eye to cyber criminals. “There is an enormous shadow economy that exists in Eastern Europe. In some countries, sophisticated hackers are seen as national assets,” he said. Kalinin and Drinkman were previously charged in New Jersey as “Hacker 1” and “Hacker 2” in a 2009 indictment charging Gonzalez in connection with five breaches. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan announced two other indictments against Kalinin, one charging he hacked servers used by Nasdaq from November 2008 through October 2010. It said he installed malicious software that enabled him and others to execute commands to delete, change or steal data. The infected servers did not include the trading platform that allows Nasdaq customers to buy and sell securities, prosecutors said. Officials with Nasdaq said they could not immediately comment. A source with knowledge of the breach said on Thursday the indictment was not related to a 2010 attack that Nasdaq had previously disclosed, which was targeted against Directors Desk, a service used by corporate boards to share documents and communicate with executives, among other things. The source, who asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter, said that hackers appear to have used their access to the firm’s network to create their own landing page on a Nasdaq website, where users were directed when they wanted to change their passwords. The second indictment filed against Kalinin in Manhattan, which was unsealed on Thursday, charged that he worked with a sixth hacker, Russian Nikolay Nasenkov, 31, to steal bank account information from thousands of customers at Citibank  and PNC Bank from 2005 to 2008, resulting in the theft of millions of dollars. Mark Rasch, a former federal cyber crimes prosecutor, told Reuters that the arrests show that law enforcement is making progress in identifying those responsible for major cyber crimes. “They involve dozens or even hundreds of people huddled over computer terminals all over the world in a common purpose of stealing of disseminating credit card numbers,” said Rasch, who was not involved in bringing the case. Among the breaches cited in the New Jersey indictment, prosecutors charged that the group was responsible for the theft of more than 130 million credit card numbers from U.S. payment processor Heartland Payment Systems Inc beginning in December 2007, resulting in approximately $200 million of losses. That was the same case for which Gonzalez was convicted and which was the largest case of its kind before the latest indictments. Heartland released a statement praising authorities for their work: “We hope that this indictment further delivers the message that prolific hacking organizations worldwide will be pursued and charged for crimes such as this one.” The indictment charged that they took approximately 30 million payment card numbers from British payment processor Commidea Ltd in 2008 and 800,000 card numbers from Visa Inc’s  licensee Visa Jordan in 2011. An attack on Global Payment Systems that begin in about January 2011 resulted in the theft of more than 950,000 cards and losses of about $93 million, according to the indictment. It charged the ring with stealing approximately 2 million credit card numbers from French retailer Carrefour SA, beginning as early as October 2007 and said the theft of card numbers from Dexia Bank Belgium resulted in $1.7 million in losses. Other victims included Dow Jones, Wet Seal Inc and 7-Eleven Inc, according to prosecutors. Dow Jones said in a statement that there was “no evidence” that information of Dow Jones or Wall Street Journal customers information was compromised as a result of the breaches.

166,V,U.S. judge rejects Fed cap on debit card swipe fees,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge has sided with retailers seeking a lower cap on fees charged by banks for debit card transactions in a key ruling that dragged down the shares of card companies Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc. Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled on Wednesday that the Federal Reserve had ignored the intent Congress when it capped the fees banks can charge retailers when their customers use debit cards. The 2010 Dodd-Frank law called for limits on those fees. Retailers have since argued that the Fed’s cap of 21 cents per transaction was higher than Congress intended. “Today’s decision ... is a victory for consumers and small business around the country and will lead to lower interchange rates for billions of debit card transactions each year,” said Senator Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat who introduced the swipe fee provision to Dodd-Frank. The ruling caused the shares of the two largest payment network operators to plunge. Visa and MasterCard set the fee level that banks charge retailers for using their networks. Visa’s shares fell as much as 11 percent and ended 7.5 percent lower, while MasterCard, which reported stronger-than-expected earnings earlier in the day, dropped as much as 6 percent before recovering to end 1.5 percent higher. Both companies declined to comment on the ruling. The shares of other major credit card companies, American Express Co and Discover Financial Services, also dropped by 1.9 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively. The 21-cent cap likely will remain in place until the Fed rewrites its rules or appeals the decision. Fed spokeswoman Barbara Hagenbaugh said the regulator was reviewing the judge’s ruling. In his opinion, Leon wrote that the Fed disregarded the statutory intent of Congress by “inappropriately inflating all debit card transaction fees by billions of dollars.” The so-called Durbin amendment was introduced near the end of the Dodd-Frank negotiations and was intended to reduce burdens on retailers, and hopefully trickle down to consumers in the form of lower prices. It was praised by retailers, but aggravated banks, which said they might have to charge consumers extra for debit cards to make up for the lost revenue. When the Fed announced its cap, which was higher than the regulator initially proposed, retail groups protested that it let banks charge higher fees than the law intended. The amendment called on the Fed to consider certain costs to banks of providing debit cards when it set the fee cap. When the rule was issued in June 2011, the National Retail Federation and other groups said the Fed inappropriately looked at bank costs beyond those the Durbin amendment wanted considered. Roberta Torian, a partner at law firm Reed Smith, which represents some banks, said the Fed considered costs for things such as network connectivity that were not explicitly listed in Dodd-Frank. “They exercised their discretion in looking at any costs that were not prohibited by Congress,” Torian added. Claiming the Fed had bowed to pressure from financial industry lobbyists, the merchant groups sued the regulator in November 2011. Various retail lobby groups on Wednesday applauded the judge’s decision to throw out the Fed’s rule. “From the very beginning, retailers and restaurants knew the Federal Reserve Board of Governors had grossly misapplied the swipe fee law,” Mallory Duncan, general counsel at the National Retail Federation, said in a statement after the ruling. “They failed to heed Congress’ call to set fee standards that were ‘reasonable’ and ‘proportional’ to the actual cost of a transaction.” The head of a banking group warned of “even more chaos ahead for consumers and small banks.” “Congress ought to save families from this uncertainty by repealing this government mandated price-fixing,” said Richard Hunt, president of the Consumer Bankers Association, a trade group that represents retail banks.

168,V,"US STOCKS-S&P; 500 gains for 6th straight session, Apple falls","* Syria accepts Russia’s diplomatic proposal to end crisis * Apple shares fall after unveiling new products * Goldman Sachs, Visa, Nike to be added to Dow industrials * McDonald’s reports August sales, shares rise * Indexes up: Dow 0.9 pct, S&P; 0.7 pct, Nasdaq 0.6 pct By Ryan Vlastelica NEW YORK, Sept 10 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday, with the S&P; 500 index advancing  for its longest stretch since early July, as an alternative proposal emerged that could avert a possible Western military strike on Syria. Encouraging economic data from China reinforced the view the world’s second-largest economy was stabilizing and gave investors further reason to buy. All 10 S&P; industry sectors ended higher, though energy  was pressured by a drop in crude oil prices. Tech shares  also came off their highs as Apple Inc fell sharply, weighing on the S&P; and Nasdaq. Analysts said new developments about Syria reduced risk for  financial markets as Syria accepted a Russian proposal to give up chemical weapons and win a reprieve from U.S. military strikes. “Several things continue to calm investors and make equities look attractive,” said Paul Zemsky, head of asset allocation at ING Investment Management in New York. “The new proposal creates a potential scenario where the U.S. doesn’t have to go in militarily. We were worried not just about Syria, but also the impact that this would spread to other nations in the Middle East.” After the S&P; 500 posted its worst monthly performance since May 2012 in August, the broad index has rallied 3.1 percent over the past six straight sessions of gains. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 127.94 points, or 0.85 percent, at 15,191.06. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up 12.28 points, or 0.73 percent, at 1,683.99. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 22.84 points, or 0.62 percent, at 3,729.02. Geopolitical uncertainty has driven market movement in recent weeks, with investors especially watching global oil prices for any sign that military action could constrain supply. With that threat seemingly less likely, oil prices fell 2 percent on Tuesday. Shares of Apple fell 2.3 percent to $494.65 after the company’s latest product unveilings, which included two new versions of its iPhone line. About 6.5 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and NYSE MKT, above the daily average so far this year of about 6.24 billion shares. About 64 percent of companies traded on the New York Stock Exchange closed higher on Tuesday while 64 percent of Nasdaq-listed shares ended up. Economic data in China showed stronger-than-expected industrial output while retail sales grew at the fastest pace this year. “Investors were worried about how far China would have to fall until it found some kind of economic equilibrium, and it looks like it found the level,” said Zemsky, who helps oversee $180 billion. “That calms fears that the major sources of growth are still out there and not sputtering along.” S&P; Dow Jones Indices announced the biggest shake-up for the Dow Jones Industrial Average in almost a decade, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Visa Inc and Nike Inc  replacing Bank of America Corp, Hewlett-Packard Co  and Alcoa Inc, respectively. The changes will take effect on Sept. 23. Goldman rose 3.5 percent to $165.14 while Visa gained 3.4 percent to $184.59 and Nike advanced 2.2 percent to $66.82. Alcoa lost 0.4 percent to $8.05, Bank of America added 0.9 percent to $14.61 and HP shed 0.4 percent to $22.27. McDonald’s Corp gained 0.5 percent to $96.89 after the fast-food restaurant chain reported a higher-than-expected 1.9 percent increase in global sales at established restaurants in August. Urban Outfitters Inc slumped 10 percent to $38.35 as the S&P;’s biggest loser after Janney Montgomery Scott cut its price target on the stock to $46 from $52.",9102013,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-usa-stocks/us-stocks-sp-500-gains-for-6th-straight-session-apple-falls-idUSL2N0H61YS20130910
169,V,Brighter days may await stocks leaving Dow industrials,"NEW YORK, Sept 10 (Reuters) - The big shakeup in the Dow Jones industrial average’s membership may yield some surprising results when it comes to stock performance. By one measure, at least, the index’s three “has-beens” - Hewlett-Packard Co, Alcoa Inc and Bank of America Corp - look like they have significantly more upside potential than do the newcomers: Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Visa Inc <V. n> and Nike Inc. An invitation to join the Dow has not always been a sign of good things to come for a company’s shareholders, but getting the boot from the index has by no means meant disaster either. Former Dow components such as Honeywell International Inc , Altria Group Inc <Mo. n>, Monde International Inc  and Kraft Foods Group Inc have prospered since leaving the Dow. At the same time, other former Dow stocks, among them Citigroup Inc <C. n>, General Motors Co, AIG International Group Inc and Eastman Kodak, have struggled mightily. Citigroup is down roughly 90 percent in the last decade, when its share price is adjusted for a 1-for-10 reverse stock split, and Kodak is just trying to survive. UnitedHealth Group Inc <Unh. n> and Chevron Corp  have out gained the Dow since being added as components. And tech powerhouses Microsoft and Intel Corp  are essentially unchanged in price over the past decade, while the Dow 30 has risen more than 50 percent. Alcoa, Hewlett-Packard and Bank of America, on average, are undervalued by more than 30 percent, according to a valuation metric used by Thomson Reuters StarMine. By contrast, Star Mine’s so-called intrinsic value for Goldman Sachs, Visa and Nike implies these three, on average, offer little to no upside from their current stock prices. Goldman is the only one of the three new components with the potential for gain, according to StarMine. The investment bank, at $164.35 a share on Tuesday, trades at a discount of roughly 30 percent to its intrinsic value of $235.67, a potential 43 percent gain if the model proves accurate. Nike, at $66.41, and Visa, at $183.69, are overvalued by 20 percent and 25 percent, respectively, according to StarMine. Intrinsic value gauges a company’s current stock price against its long-term earnings potential as estimated by the most accurate analysts covering the stock. By this measure, the best pick of former Dow components is Hewlett-Packard, which StarMine estimates has an intrinsic value of $44.70 a share, compared with Tuesday’s price of $22.20, a potential gain of more than 100 percent. Bank of America, meanwhile, could rise 63 percent from its current $14.64. According to StarMine projections, its intrinsic value is $23.83. Even Alcoa, which hasn’t had a stock price north of $10 since May 2012, is seen having a potential gain of roughly 6 percent from its current price of $8.05, the lowest of any current Dow component.",9102013,http://www.reuters.com/article/dowchanges-performance/brighter-days-may-await-stocks-leaving-dow-industrials-idUSL2N0H619620130910
170,V,Dow Jones index announces biggest shake-up in a decade,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - In the biggest shake-up of the Dow Jones industrial average in nearly a decade, Goldman Sachs, Visa and Nike will join the storied 30-stock index, with Bank of America, which just two years ago was the largest U.S. bank by assets, one of the names exiting the Dow. The three newcomers - an investment bank, credit card payment processor and apparel company, respectively - will also replace Alcoa, in the index since 1959, and Hewlett-Packard Co. The changes will take effect at the opening of trading September 23, said S&P; Dow Jones Indices, whose index committee makes decisions on the make-up of the average. With the changes, the committee again passed on a chance to include Apple Inc and Google Inc, the first- and third-largest U.S. companies by market value. Apple stock trades above $500 and Google closed Monday above $888. “We looked at a handful above $200, Google and Apple among them,” said David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the S&P; Index Committee. “Those are obviously well-known, blue-chip, global companies. Both won’t work in the Dow because of their price.” The Dow, created in 1896, is still considered Main Street’s view of the stock market, even though its method of weighting stocks by price, rather than market value has kept out names like those two, among the most important U.S. companies, because of the outsized influence the stocks would have on the average. Blitzer said S&P; Dow Jones Indices has discussed changes to its methodology and would likely talk about it again. “It’s the most recognizable index in the world, but there’s almost no money in it,” said Dave Nadig, President of ETF analytics at IndexUniverse LLC. Even though S&P; Dow Jones Indices classifies Visa Inc as a technology name, adding the nation’s largest credit-card processor along with Goldman Sachs Group Inc reflects a further tilt toward financial services. Bank of America’s run in the Dow was not one for the history books. The stock joined the index in February 2008, just a few months into what became the worst U.S. recession since the Great Depression. The stock is down more than 65 percent since it joined the Dow. The company was engulfed by the financial and housing crisis after it acquired sub-prime mortgage originator Countrywide Financial in January 2008. The bank said Tuesday being removed from the index “has no impact on our business or our strategy for providing solid returns to shareholders.” With a market value of about $157 billion, it becomes - other than Apple and Google - the biggest U.S. company not included in the average. Nike Inc’s addition marks the first inclusion of an apparel maker since International Shoe was replaced in 1933, according to S&P; Dow Jones Indices records. Following the announcement, Visa shares were up 2.9 percent at $183.68, Goldman rose 3.6 percent to $165.21 and Nike added 1.7 percent to $66.51 after earlier hitting $66.98, a record high. The Dow was up 0.7 percent on the day. The changes announced Tuesday are the first in nearly a year, after UnitedHealth Group replaced Kraft’s spinoff Mondelez International in September 2012. Just $30 to $35 billion is indexed against the Dow, according to Blitzer, just a fraction of the roughly $1.6 trillion indexed to the S&P; 500. “It is certainly a retail (investor) number, when people talk about the Dow,” said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. Funds that attempt to replicate major indexes make up a large part of the U.S. stock market. Because they are designed to mimic market performance at a low cost, they have become among the most popular investment vehicles for investors. “Most of the money is being managed toward the broader indices so I don’t think you have that much in the way of tracking. I don’t think it’s as important as when there is an S&P; (change),” Saluzzi said, referring to when index funds buy companies added to an index and sell those that are removed. The Dow’s 30-stock membership is generally considered too small for a broad-based mutual fund, and the priced-weighted design is problematic because smaller companies with higher share prices can exert disproportionate influence. Presently, IBM, the highest-price stock in the average, accounts for more than 9 percent of the index, even though it is the eighth-largest by market value. The additions of Visa and Goldman partly tame the heavy IBM influence. IBM’s weighting in the Dow will drop to about 8 percent from 9.4 percent, and Visa and Goldman will account for 7.7 and 6.9 percent of the average, according to Birinyi Associates. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF, a trust that tracks the Dow’s performance, has net assets of $11.9 billion, ranking it in the top 30 among U.S. ETFs, according to Thomson Reuters data. The largest ETF, the SPDR S&P; 500 ETF, has $143.9 billion in assets. In volume terms the Dow ETF, previously known as the Diamonds Trust, ranks 35th among the most actively traded ETFs with a 50-day average of 5.4 million shares exchanging hands. The SPY averages 106 million shares traded daily. The three stocks slated to join the Dow have outperformed the blue-chip index’s 14.9 percent gain in 2013 to Monday’s close. Visa had gained 17.8 percent, Goldman 25 percent and Nike 26.7 percent. Of the stocks that will leave, Alcoa had underperformed the index, with a 6.9 percent year-to-date fall. Bank of America was up nearly 25 percent and HP had jumped 57 percent. Alcoa said being dropped from the Dow would not affect its ability to carry out its strategy. It seen as a candidate for elimination for some time, with its market cap of $8.7 billion easily the lowest in the average. It is the first three-for-three change to the index since April 8, 2004, when American International Group, Pfizer and Verizon replaced AT&T; Corp, Eastman Kodak and International Paper. AT&T; later returned following a merger. ",9102013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-dow-components/dow-jones-index-announces-biggest-shake-up-in-a-decade-idUSBRE9890MK20130910

Also lifting the S&P; 500 index for a sixth straight day was encouraging economic data from Chinal. Nine of the 10 S&P; 500 sectors rose, the only exception being energy, which dipped with a drop in crude oil prices. Fears of action against Syria eased after U.S. President Barack Obama said Monday he saw a possible breakthrough in the situation after Russia proposed that Syria hand over its chemical weapons for destruction, a proposal Syrian Prime Minister Wael al-Halki said his country supported. While such a move could avert a potential Western-led military strike, the White House said Obama would press ahead with his plan to ask Congress to approve the use of military force against the country. “We don’t know if this is just talk or if it could happen, but right now tensions have cooled and the market likes that,” said Michael Matousek, head trader at U.S. Global Investors Inc in San Antonio.” The Dow Jones industrial average was up 116.90 points, or 0.78 percent, at 15,180.02. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up 11.62 points, or 0.70 percent, at 1,683.33. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 21.72 points, or 0.59 percent, at 3,727.91. Geopolitical uncertainty has driven market movement in recent weeks, with investors especially watching global oil prices for any sign that military action could constrain supply. Crude fell 2.5 percent on Tuesday. Economic data in China showed stronger-than-expected industrial output while retail sales grew at the fastest pace this year, reinforcing signs that the world’s second-largest economy was stabilizing after slowing for more than two years. On Monday, Wall Street climbed following strong Chinese export data. After suffering its worst monthly performance since May 2012 in August, the S&P; has rallied 3.1 percent over the past six sessions, its longest winning streak since early July.

173,V,"US STOCKS-Wall St to open higher on China data, waning Syria fears","* Syria fears ease on possible diplomatic solution * China data points to stabilizing economy * Goldman Sachs, Visa, Nike to be added to Dow Industrials * McDonald’s reports August sales, shares rise * Futures up: Dow 79 pts, S&P; 9.9 pts, Nasdaq 19 pts By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, Sept 10 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were poised to open higher Tuesday, putting the S&P; 500 on track for a sixth day of gains, following further upbeat economic data from China and as an alternative solution emerged to a possible Western military strike against Syria. Fears of action against Syria eased after U.S. President Barack Obama said Monday he saw a possible breakthrough in the crisis with Syria after Russia proposed that its ally Damascus hands over its chemical weapons for destruction, which could avert planned U.S. military strikes. Syrian Prime Minister Wael al-Halki said his country supported a Russian proposal for Damascus to give up chemical weapons to avoid a possible U.S. military strike. “Certainly there was the potential for escalation, which was the market’s primary concern, and that seemed to be the issue out there,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. Economic data in China showed stronger-than-expected industrial output and retail sales showed their fastest growth this year, reinforcing signs that the world’s second-largest economy was stabilizing after slowing for more than two years. “Another good China-data day and that has certainly been helping,” Ghriskey said. “Anything that is going to forestall a strike on Syria certainly gets the risk appetite back into the marketplace.” However, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama would press ahead with his plan to ask Congress to approve the use of military force in Syria, despite Syria’s recent acceptance of the Russian proposal. Oil prices pulled back, with U.S. crude off 2.1 percent. Crude prices rose 2.7 percent last week on worries a strike against Syria could spark a wider conflict and heightened supply concerns. After suffering its worst monthly performance since May 2012 in August, the S&P; 500 has rallied for the past five sessions for a 2.4 percent gain that marks its longest winning streak in two months. S&P; 500 futures rose 9.9 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures gained 79 points, and Nasdaq 100 futures added 19 points. S&P; Dow Jones Indices said Goldman Sachs Group Inc  will replace Bank of American Corp, Visa Inc will replace Hewlett-Packard Co and Nike Inc will replace Alcoa Inc in the Dow Jones Industrial Average after the close of trading Sept. 20. Goldman shares rose 2.2 percent to $163, Visa gained 2.1 percent to $182.33 and Nike advanced 1.8 percent to $66.55 in premarket trading, while Alcoa lost 1.2 percent to $7.98, Bank of America added 0.3 percent to $14.52 and Hewlett-Packard shed 0.9 percent to $22.15.

175,V,CORRECTED-Brighter days may await stocks leaving Dow industrials,"(In paragraph 4, corrects AIG company name and stock symbols for AIG and GM) By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, Sept 10 (Reuters) - The big shakeup in the Dow Jones industrial average’s membership may yield some surprising results when it comes to stock performance. By one measure, at least, the index’s three “has-beens” - Hewlett-Packard Co, Alcoa Inc and Bank of America Corp look like they have significantly more upside potential than do the newcomers: Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Visa Inc and Nike Inc. An invitation to join the Dow has not always been a sign of good things to come for a company’s shareholders, but getting the boot from the index has by no means meant disaster either. Former Dow components such as Honeywell International Inc , Altria Group Inc, Monde International Inc  and Kraft Foods Group Inc have prospered since leaving the Dow. At the same time, other former Dow stocks, among them Citigroup Inc, General Motors Co, American International Group Inc and Eastman Kodak Co, have struggled mightily. Citigroup is down roughly 90 percent in the last decade, when its share price is adjusted for a 1-for-10 reverse stock split, and Kodak is just trying to survive. UnitedHealth Group Inc and Chevron Corp have out gained the Dow since being added as components. And tech powerhouses Microsoft Corp and Intel Corp  are essentially unchanged in price over the past decade, while the Dow 30 has risen more than 50 percent. Alcoa, Hewlett-Packard and Bank of America, on average, are undervalued by more than 30 percent, according to a valuation metric used by Thomson Reuters StarMine. By contrast, StarMine’s so-called intrinsic value for Goldman Sachs, Visa and Nike implies these three, on average, offer little to no upside from their current stock prices. Goldman is the only one of the three new components with the potential for gain, according to StarMine. The investment bank, at $164.35 a share on Tuesday, trades at a discount of roughly 30 percent to its intrinsic value of $235.67, a potential 43 percent gain if the model proves accurate. Nike, at $66.41, and Visa, at $183.69, are overvalued by 20 percent and 25 percent, respectively, according to StarMine. Intrinsic value gauges a company’s current stock price against its long-term earnings potential as estimated by the most accurate analysts covering the stock. By this measure, the best pick of former Dow components is Hewlett-Packard, which StarMine estimates has an intrinsic value of $44.70 a share, compared with Tuesday’s price of $22.20, a potential gain of more than 100 percent. Bank of America, meanwhile, could rise 63 percent from its current $14.64. According to StarMine projections, its intrinsic value is $23.83. Even Alcoa, which hasn’t had a stock price north of $10 since May 2012, is seen having a potential gain of roughly 6 percent from its current price of $8.05, the lowest of any current Dow component.

176,V,U.S. judge hears chorus of complaints over $7.2 billion credit card pact,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge on Thursday heard a diverse parade of objectors seeking to derail a record $7.2 billion class action settlement he is weighing between merchants and credit companies Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc over credit card fees. U.S. District Judge John Gleeson of Brooklyn reserved final judgment at the conclusion of a roughly 5 1/2-hour hearing, saying he had been presented with “very important and difficult issues.” His decision could take several months to deliver. Were Gleeson to approve the deal, it would be the largest federal antitrust settlement in history. Merchants first sued Visa and MasterCard in 2005, accusing the two companies of fixing the fees charged to merchants each time their customers used their credit or debit cards. They were accused also of preventing merchants from steering customers to cheaper forms of payments and other anti-competitive behavior. Visa and MasterCard have denied the allegations. Gleeson gave preliminary approval to the settlement in November 2012. But the deal has been opposed by thousands of objectors. In a packed courtroom, Gleeson heard complaints about the deal from more than a dozen representatives of the objectors, including retailers Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Target Corp, the states of Ohio and California, consumer groups and owners of a gas station in Minneapolis. They revived concerns about a litigation release in the settlement that benefits Visa and MasterCard. The release forces merchants who accepted Visa or MasterCard as of last November or will do so at any time in the future to give up their right to sue the credit card companies over certain rules or similar ones indefinitely. Stephen Neuwirth of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, an attorney representing Home Depot Inc, told Gleeson that the provision violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Neuwirth argued that Home Depot and other merchants that object to the deal should be able to “decide for themselves whether to tie their fate with the class representatives or go it alone.” With the broad litigation release, Neuwirth argued that Visa and MasterCard would be forever protected from lawsuits involving any of the rules they require merchants to follow. Kenneth Gallo of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, an attorney for MasterCard, countered that rules not predicated on the same facts as the existing rules would not be covered by the release. But the judge said he had concerns that the release may cover territory that could not be foreseen. At one point, he asked the lead counsel for the class plaintiffs, Craig Wildfang of Robins, Kaplan, Miller & Ciresi, whether he viewed the release the same way as the defendants. “We’re close,” Wildfang said. Wildfang conceded that he wished the release had “fewer words,” but he said it was the result of a necessary compromise. Objectors to the settlement also complained that the changes Visa and MasterCard were required to make as a result of the settlement would not benefit them. The settlement allows merchants to surcharge customers who use Visa and MasterCard in certain situations to try to drive price competition from the credit card providers. But lawyers for the objectors noted that more than 10 states prohibited surcharging. Jeffrey Shinder of Constantine Cannon, an attorney for several objectors including Amazon.com Inc, said that to certify a mandatory injunctive relief class in which some merchants would not benefit violated holdings made by the U.S. Supreme Court in a case known as Wal-Mart v. Dukes. During the hearing, Gleeson asked for changes that could be made to the settlement that would entice some objectors to participate in the settlement. But at one point, while hearing objections made by a representative from 7-Eleven Inc, he voiced frustration. He said some objectors appeared to be seeking more than what they could expect to obtain than if they won at a trial. “To get relief, you’ve got to win,” he said. “A settlement reflects the uncertainty about the ability to win.” Visa and Mastercard have said they are confident the deal will receive Gleeson’s support. The case is In Re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, No. 05-1720. For the plaintiffs (co-lead class counsel): Laddie Montague of Berger & Montague; Craig Wildfang of Robins, Kaplan, Miller & Ciresi; Patrick Coughlin of Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd. For Visa: Robert Vizas of Arnold & Porter. For MasterCard: Keila Ravelo of Willkie Farr & Gallagher and Kenneth Gallo of Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison.

177,V,"TD Bank, CIBC reach deal on Aeroplan Visa card","(Reuters) - Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO) agreed on Monday to buy about half of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce’s (CM.TO) Aeroplan Visa (V.N) credit card portfolio in a deal that will see both banks issue the popular and lucrative rewards card. The agreement, which drove shares of Aeroplan loyalty program operator Aimia (AIM.TO) to a five-year high, averts a potential legal battle between the two banks and also eliminates uncertainty over the future of the card that could have seen customers flee to other banks. “It’s safe to say that TD is the winner from this (of the two banks),” said Gavin Graham, chief strategy officer at Integris Pension Management Corp. TD, Canada’s second-largest bank, will pay C$162.5 million ($157.59 million) to CIBC to acquire about 550,000 cardholder accounts, representing about C$3 billion in card balances and C$20 billion in annual retail spending, TD said. It will also become the card’s primary issuer. CIBC, the country’s No. 5 lender, will receive an additional payment from Aimia and will keep the remaining 630,000 Aeroplan accounts held by existing banking customers. It will also continue to issue the card under the 10-year deal. The deal resolves a months-long battle for control of the lucrative Aeroplan card, which allows customers to earn points that can be cashed in for flights on Air Canada ACb.TO and its partner airlines, as well as other goods. CIBC has been the card’s main issuer for more than two decades, but lost that role earlier this year, after Aimia could not come to terms on an extension with CIBC and instead entered into a partnership with TD. CIBC had a right to match the terms of TD’s deal, but said the deal was structured in a way that attempted to nullify that right. Last month, the banks said they were in talks for a compromise deal, although CIBC noted that if an agreement were not reached it retained its rights to exercise legal options. TD Chief Executive Ed Clark told Reuters that doing a deal allowed TD to acquire card customers upfront, rather than having to entice them to come to the bank and risk losing them to competitors. “There’s kind of “jump ball” in the marketplace to see who’s going to win those customers,” said Clark. “(So) you’ve got to spend a lot of marketing dollars and try to win every one of those customers over, whereas here, they’re automatically your customers.” TD, which plans to launch five new Aeroplan cards in Canada and the United States, said the deal would contribute 10 Canadian cents per share to earnings next year on an adjusted basis and would contribute about 15 Canadian cents a share in 2015. TD has been bulking up its credit card business for the last several years and with this deal will unquestionably be the market leader in Canada. The business offers higher margins and return on equity than traditional lending, and TD’s increased exposure comes as Canadian consumer loan growth slows amid a cooling housing market. Barclays Capital analyst John Aiken said the fact that TD would be acquiring customers rather than having to win them over was positive, but said the negative in the deal was that TD would not be the sole Aeroplan Visa issuer in Canada. “We do not believe that this was the original vision when TD initially pursued the contract with Aimia,” he said in a note. For CIBC, analysts said the deal was a better outcome than the potential of losing the entire Aeroplan portfolio, which had seemed a possibility after TD reached its deal with Aimia. However, the bank said the agreement will trim its earnings by about 45 Canadian cents a share on an annual basis, the bank said. Last month, CIBC disclosed that the Aeroplan card portfolio generated 95 Canadian cents per share in profit over the 12 months ended July 31, or about 12 percent of the bank’s overall profit during that period. Speaking on a conference call, CIBC CEO Gerry McCaughey deflected questions from analysts about why CIBC was unable to reach a deal with Aimia to extend its partnership before TD entered the picture. “The discussions that went on over the last very long period of time, as to our renewal on a unilateral basis with Aimia, are moot at this point,” he said. In addition to maintaining half of the Aeroplan portfolio, CIBC plans to launch a new flight rewards card. Shares of TD were up 1.4 percent at C$91.14, while CIBC was up 1 percent at C$81.92. Aimia was up 6 percent at C$17.63, and earlier in the session touched its highest level since April 2008.

178,V,"Mastercard, Visa to cut French card fees -watchdog","PARIS, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Mastercard and Visa  have agreed to cut the fees to process credit card transactions in France by almost half. The French Competition Authority announced the agreement with Visa and Mastercard in the wake of proposed legislation from the European Commission that banks and payment firms limit the fees they charge on card payments. Card companies have waged a 20-year battle with the EU’s executive, which enforces antitrust rules in the 28-country bloc. A spokeswoman for the French regulator said that its remit was transactions within France, rather than the cross-border European transactions that are governed by the EU’s regulator. Both Visa and Mastercard will cut interbank fees to around 0.28 percent of the transaction value from about 0.5 percent currently, and will also reduce cash-machine fees to 0.55 euros ($0.74) per withdrawal from 0.75 and 0.60 respectively, the competition authority said in a statement. The agreement also comes after several moves by the French watchdog to cut bank customers’ fees in France. French banks agreed in 2011 to cut interbank card fees by more than a third and last year they pledged to cut fees charged for direct-debit bill payments. The watchdog has in the past criticised French banks for charging some of the highest interbank fees in Europe. A Visa Europe spokesman declined to comment. Mastercard did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ",9232013,http://www.reuters.com/article/mastercard-visa/mastercard-visa-to-cut-french-card-fees-watchdog-idUSL5N0HJ1H320130923
179,V,"Kenya's KCB to grow in South Sudan with VISA, more branches","JUBA, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) , the biggest bank in South Sudan, plans to grow by launching the first credit card service in the young African country and adding more branches, executives told Reuters. KCB has won a licence from VISA Inc to launch credit cards in South Sudan, a war-torn country where few people have a bank account, the executives said. KCB was one of the first foreign banks to set up shop in Juba after the end of civil war between south and north Sudan in 2005, which led six years later to the secession of South Sudan. South Sudan has a large business potential with a population of nearly 12 million but has struggled to build up state institutions and an efficient legal system. That has not deterred foreign banks from arriving. Apart from KCB, Qatar National Bank, Kenya’s Co-Operative Bank and a bank funded by Dubai Islamic Bank  are also active in South Sudan. KCB now has a market share of 42 percent serving 138,000 customers, Rebecca Likami, deputy managing director of KCB in South Sudan, said in an interview. “We have started VISA,” Likami said. “Some KCB outlets accept VISA. By the end of this year we should (have) VISA in all the hotels.” She added customers should be able to use VISA cards at automated teller machines (ATMs) from next year. The bank also plans to add more branches beyond the existing 20, said Harun Kibogong, KCB’s managing director, without being more specific. The bank has started offering mortgages as well, another novelty in one of the world’s least developed countries. “We have mortgages because there is a lot of construction taking place across the country. Housing is lacking in Juba,” said Likami. “We have developers financing, then we have the normal mortgage for people who want to buy the house,” she said. KCB was recently hit by a strike of some of its 380 staff over salaries but Likami said the issue was being worked out. She also said the central bank had not yet resumed pumping dollars into commercial banks after the first oil revenues landed in its accounts in September with the restart of oil exports. “They are ... waiting. I am not sure what they are doing but I believe they will be soon releasing funds to the market,” she said. South Sudan depends on oil exports, routed through Sudan, to fund its budget and get dollars to finance imports of food and consumer goods. A 16-month oil shutdown due to tensions with Sudan has posed huge liquidity problems for commercial banks. KCB South Sudan boosted profit after tax to 41.5 million South Sudanese Pounds (SSP) (around $14 million) in 2012 from 25.4 million SSP the year before, according to its annual report.",10072013,http://www.reuters.com/article/kcb-southsudan/kenyas-kcb-to-grow-in-south-sudan-with-visa-more-branches-idUSL6N0HW0RD20131007
180,V,Visa profit falls as U.S. consumer spending weakens,"(Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N), the world’s largest credit and debit card company, reported a 28 percent fall in quarterly profit due to a higher income tax provision and was slightly pessimistic about its outlook in the face of soft U.S. consumer spending. Visa shares fell 3.1 percent to $197.50 in after-hours trade while those of rival MasterCard Inc (MA.N) fell 1 percent, ahead of its results on Thursday. Visa said it expects constant dollar revenue growth of low double digits and a foreign exchange headwind of 2 percentage points over the next year. It said its expectations are slightly lower than they were in June. It maintained its forecast for percentage growth per share in 2014 in the mid-to-high teens despite the continued slow pace of global economic recovery, and the growing impact of a strong U.S. dollar. Visa also authorized a new $5 billion share buyback program and said it believed the Federal Reserve had a strong case in its appeal against a court ruling limiting the fees banks charge retailers for debit card use. A successful appeal against the court ruling in July would protect an important revenue stream for card companies. Both Visa and MasterCard face slowing growth in the United States, their largest market. U.S. consumer sentiment slid in September to its lowest in five months as consumer lending rates rose and shoppers eyed sluggish economic growth ahead, a survey showed. Visa said its U.S. domestic payment volume dropped to 8 percent of global volumes in September from 11 percent in August. Visa and MasterCard have been trying to capture new business in emerging markets where more customers are signing up for cards and digital payments instead of cash. Net income attributable to Visa fell to $1.19 billion, or $1.85 per Class A share, from $1.66 billion, or $2.47, a year earlier. Analysts on average, had expected the company to earn $1.85 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total operating revenue rose 9 percent to $2.97 billion but came in short of analysts’ expectation of $3.02 billion due to a strong U.S. dollar. Visa’s results were hit by a $574 million income tax provision, compared with a benefit of $74 million a year earlier. The company gave no reason for the bigger tax bill. Visa’s payment volumes rose 13 percent to $1.1 trillion in the quarter. Foster City, California-based Visa's shares have risen 35 percent since the beginning of the year, outperforming the broader S&P; 500 Index .SPX, which has gained around 24 percent.

185,V,U.S. judge approves retail credit card fee settlement,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge on Friday approved an estimated $5.7 billion class action settlement between merchants and Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) over credit card fees despite objections from thousands of retailers who complained it was inadequate. The settlement is believed to be the largest in a U.S. antitrust class action. Merchants first sued Visa and MasterCard in 2005, accusing the two companies of fixing the fees charged to merchants each time their customers used their credit or debit cards. They were accused also of preventing merchants from steering customers to cheaper forms of payments. U.S. District Judge John Gleeson of Brooklyn, New York, approved the settlement in a written order. He also dismissed some of the objections made by merchants opposed to the deal as hyperbole. At a fairness hearing in September, he noted that one objector cast Visa and MasterCard as Nazis. “I conclude that the proposed settlement secures both a significant damage award and meaningful injunctive relief for a class of merchants that would face a substantial likelihood of securing no relief at all if this case were to proceed,” Gleeson wrote. The value of the settlement, reached last year, decreased to $5.7 billion from roughly $7.2 billion after thousands of merchants opted out of the deal, according to Craig Wildfang, an attorney for the plaintiffs. Mallory Duncan, general counsel for the National Retail Federation, which opposed the settlement, said in a statement that her organization was reviewing Gleeson’s ruling and expected to file an appeal. “The settlement permanently ties the hands of thousands of businesses who wanted nothing to do with this misguided case, and a decision to approve it violates established law and common sense,” she said.

For Visa and MasterCard, Gleeson’s decision could go a long way to alleviate a major legal headache that has plagued them for more than a decade. In 2003, two years before the current case started, Visa and MasterCard settled a similar case with merchants over rules governing the use of their cards. Visa Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf said in a statement that the company “realized a significant achievement in our efforts to resolve the long-standing legal differences between merchants and the payments industry.” MasterCard general counsel Noah Hanft called Gleeson’s decision “an important milestone in putting this litigation behind us,” according to a statement. Approval of the current settlement has been opposed by many of the largest players in the retail industry. Around 8,000 merchants, accounting for about 25 percent of the transactional volume at issue in the case, opted out of the settlement. Among those opting out were the largest retailers in the United States, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), and Target Corp (TGT.N). Those businesses have complained about a broad litigation release in the settlement. The release forces all merchants who accepted Visa or MasterCard, and even those who will in the future, to give up their right to sue the credit card companies over rules at issue in this case or similar ones they may make in the future. Those objectors also argued that the settlement offered meaningless reforms that would not help them control the costs of accepting credit cards. Under certain circumstances, the settlement allows merchants to charge customers extra if they use Visa or MasterCard credit cards.

186,V,UPDATE 2-U.S. judge approves retail credit card fee settlement,"By Andrew Longstreth NEW YORK, Dec 13 (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge on Friday approved an estimated $5.7 billion class action settlement between merchants and Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc  over credit card fees despite objections from thousands of retailers who complained it was inadequate. The settlement is believed to be the largest in a U.S. antitrust class action. Merchants first sued Visa and MasterCard in 2005, accusing the two companies of fixing the fees charged to merchants each time their customers used their credit or debit cards. They were accused also of preventing merchants from steering customers to cheaper forms of payments. U.S. District Judge John Gleeson of Brooklyn, New York, approved the settlement in a written order. He also dismissed some of the objections made by merchants opposed to the deal as hyperbole. At a fairness hearing in September, he noted that one objector cast Visa and MasterCard as Nazis. “I conclude that the proposed settlement secures both a significant damage award and meaningful injunctive relief for a class of merchants that would face a substantial likelihood of securing no relief at all if this case were to proceed,” Gleeson wrote. The value of the settlement, reached last year, decreased to $5.7 billion from roughly $7.2 billion after thousands of merchants opted out of the deal, according to Craig Wildfang, an attorney for the plaintiffs. Mallory Duncan, general counsel for the National Retail Federation, which opposed the settlement, said in a statement that her organization was reviewing Gleeson’s ruling and expected to file an appeal. “The settlement permanently ties the hands of thousands of businesses who wanted nothing to do with this misguided case, and a decision to approve it violates established law and common sense,” she said.

189,V,Target payment card data theft highlights lagging U.S. security,"BOSTON, Dec 22 (Reuters) - The massive data breach disclosed by retailer Target Corp last week is likely to teach its U.S. customers a painful lesson in payment card security and build support for an anti-fraud technology now sitting on the shelf. For years, U.S. merchants and banks have balked at adopting a well-established system that uses credit and debit cards that store information on computer chips. The technology, ubiquitous in Europe, Canada and elsewhere, makes it harder for thieves to misuse data compared with cards that store data only on magnetic stripes. The problem is the costs of the new chips and some 10 million payment terminals to process them. The delay may prove costly to Target’s U.S. customers. The third-largest U.S. retailer said unknown hackers stole data from up to 40 million credit and debit cards used at its stores in the first three weeks of the holiday season. Now, after years in which U.S. companies tolerated fraud as a cost of doing business, high-profile breaches such as the one at Target are raising demand for increased card security. “There’s no doubt in my mind it will happen over the next two years. The fraud risk is too high,” said Rush Taggart, chief security officer of CardConnect of King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, which helps merchants process payments. “I think we all wish it had happened over the last four years.” An early switch to the global card system may not have prevented the Target data theft but the chip technology would have reduced the value of the stolen data by making it harder for hackers to reuse the customer information. For one thing, the new systems are better at detecting counterfeit cards. Visa Inc has warned that merchants’ banks may start bearing the costs of fraud starting in October 2015 if the merchants don’t upgrade. In much of Europe, 94 percent of sales terminals use the chip system, according to a 2012 report by consulting firm Javelin Strategy & Research. The figure was 77 percent in Canada and Latin America. That compares with only 10 percent of U.S. sales terminals with upgrades. The report said the figure would still reach only 60 percent by Visa’s October 2015 deadline. And the timetable could face delays if merchants push back on changes that banks and processors want but will not pay for. Retailers over the summer won a ruling from a U.S. district court judge in Washington that could help them reduce the fees that banks can charge for debit card transactions. Banks had counted on those fees to pay for extra network upgrades, and the uncertainty could put off further investment, said Al Pascual, a senior analyst at Javelin. “We should move to it,” Pascual said about the new standard. “But ‘should’ and ‘would’ are two different things,” he said. Some U.S. banks, including Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo & Co, have begun to issue chip-carrying cards that meet the global standard - known as EMV, the initials of the companies that created it in 1994: Europay International SA, MasterCard and Visa. (MasterCard bought Europay in 2002.) There are now nearly 1.6 billion EMV payment cards in use worldwide. Wells Fargo said recently its U.S. customers with the Visa consumer credit cards it issues may request a new card with a chip to use while traveling. “Today, very few domestic merchant terminals support EMV technology, so there is little need for a full-scale roll-out,” a Wells Fargo spokesman said via e-mail. U.S. banks and merchants have tolerated the weak security in part because they are able absorb the costs, said David Robertson, publisher of the Nilson Report, a California trade journal that tracks the payments industry. In its August issue, Nilson said global card fraud rose to a record $11.3 billion in 2012, from just under $10 billion the year before. Nearly half the losses occurred in the United States, helped by the lack of the more advanced card readers. But on a volume basis the losses amounted to just 5.2 cents for every $100 that consumers put on payment cards, up from 5.07 cents per $100 in 2011. Those figures are insignificant for most of the players in the chain, Robertson said. “It’s a very manageable cost,” Robertson said. Organized shoplifting in comparison costs U.S. merchants around $30 billion per year, he said. Consumers, who are generally not held responsible for covering for fraudulent purchases, have had little incentive to push for change. But the rising fraud rates also mean more dangers of identity theft. Target said it was still reviewing how the attack was carried out, but experts expect that systems at cash registers were compromised. A Target spokeswoman did not respond to questions for this article. The incident appeared to be among the largest security breaches in retail history, though it fell short of the one announced by retailer TJX Cos in 2007, which was blamed on poor security in the wireless computer networks at TJX stores. Since then, retailers have upgraded their systems under what are meant to be the secure Payment Card Industry standards, or PCI, meant to cover existing magnetic stripe cards. But Gartner Research analyst Avivah Litan said many breaches since then have occurred at companies that officially met the standards. The problem is the magnetic stripe used to store data on most U.S. cards is not secure enough to begin with, said Litan, who favors upgrades to EMV. “PCI isn’t working because it is attempting to patch an inherently insecure payment card system and network,” she said. “We can’t expect retailers to patch their systems to work around the weaknesses of this antiquated technology,” she said. Nilson’s Robertson said the rise of mobile phones as payment devices may complicate upgrade plans because they could crowd out payment cards. If that happens soon, companies may have wasted billions of dollars. “It would be like investing in improving silent movies when everyone else is moving to sound,” Robertson said.",12222013,http://www.reuters.com/article/target-security-lagging/target-payment-card-data-theft-highlights-lagging-u-s-security-idUSL2N0K004A20131222
190,V,Soccer-Visa extends World Cup sponsorship to 2022,"LONDON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Credit card company Visa  has become the fifth major company to extend its World Cup sponsorship until 2022, FIFA said on Tuesday. Visa, which is also an Olympic sponsor, became a FIFA partner in the run-up to the 2010 World Cup. It replaced rival MasterCard which won a $90 million legal settlement from soccer’s ruling body FIFA after claiming it should have been given first refusal on a new deal. Financial terms of the new contract with Visa were not disclosed. It will cover the 2018 World Cup in Russia and the tournament four years later in Qatar. “Our association with the FIFA World Cup and the entire portfolio of FIFA events differentiates our brand and allows us to offer unique opportunities to our clients around the world,” said Ricardo Fort who is responsible for global sponsorship and marketing at Visa. MasterCard remains involved in soccer sponsorship through the European Champions League. German sportswear company Adidas has signed up as a FIFA sponsor until 2030 while Coca-Cola, Hyundai-Kia and Anheuser-Busch InBev have renewed until 2022. FIFA generated $370 million from marketing in 2012, out of total revenues of $1.166 billion.",1142014,http://www.reuters.com/article/soccer-world-visa/soccer-visa-extends-world-cup-sponsorship-to-2022-idUSL3N0KO43020140114
191,V,"UPDATE 2-JPMorgan profit beats estimates on lower costs, provisions","*    (Adds details) By Tanya Agrawal and David Henry Jan 14 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co reported a better-than-expected adjusted quarterly profit as the biggest U.S. bank kept a lid on costs and set aside less money to cover bad loans. The bank, which agreed last week to pay $2.6 billion to settle government and private claims over its handling of accounts of fraudster Bernie Madoff, said fourth-quarter net income fell 7.3 percent to $5.28 billion, or $1.30 per share. Adjusted for special items, the company earned $1.40 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.35, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The results took into account gains from the sale of Visa Inc shares and One Chase Manhattan Plaza and legal expenses related to the Madoff settlements. JPMorgan, which agreed to pay nearly $20 billion in 2013 to settle assorted legal claims, had estimated that settlement of the Madoff claims would subtract $850 million from fourth-quarter earnings. “It was in the best interests of our company and shareholders for us to accept responsibility, resolve these issues and move forward,”  Chairman and Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in a statement on Tuesday. JPMorgan shares, which have been trading this month at their highest levels since 2000, were up 0.5 percent at $58 before the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock rose 33 percent in 2013, in line with the 35 percent rise in the KBW Bank index and slightly ahead of the 29 percent gain in Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index. Special items highlighted by the bank subtracted 10 cents per share from fourth-quarter earnings, compared with a two-cent boost in the same quarter of 2012. The special items included a benefit of 21 cents per share from the sale of Visa shares and 8 cents from the sale of One Chase Manhattan Plaza and an expense of 27 cents per share from legal bills, including the Madoff settlements. Three months ago, JPMorgan reported its first quarterly loss under Dimon after recording after-tax expenses of $7.2 billion to settle government and private investigations. The allegations involved, among other things, shoddy dealing in mortgage instruments before the financial crisis, derivatives trading in London and pricing in electric power markets, as well as failing to report suspicions of wrongdoing by Madoff. Investors have been looking for reassurance from the company that the worst of its legal expenses are behind it. Noninterest expenses fell 3 percent to $15.55 billion during the quarter, while provisions for bad loans fell 84 percent to $104 million. JPMorgan said its assets shrank to $2.42 trillion at the end of December from $2.46 trillion three months before and $2.36 trillion a year earlier, but it remains the biggest U.S. bank by that measure. Equity underwriting revenue soared 65 percent to $436 million. But investment banking fees were pulled down by lower debt underwriting, where revenue declined 19 percent, and advisory fees, which fell 7 percent. Altogether, investment banking fees declined 3 percent. The bank’s market share in equity underwriting rose to 8.3 percent in 2013, moving it to second place in the industry from fourth. Goldman Sachs Group Inc led with 11.4 percent. Higher interest rates on home mortgage loans weighed on JPMorgan, like the rest of the banking industry. JPMorgan lost $274 million, pre-tax, making mortgage loans, compared with a profit of $789 million a year earlier as margins declined and as the company was unable to reduce expenses as quickly as lending volumes declined. The bank said it expected to lose money making mortgages again in the first quarter of this year. Reflecting a slowdown in loan refinancing, total U.S. home mortgage borrowing was down 50 percent at the end of December compared with a year earlier and down by a quarter from the end of September, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.

192,V,"RPT-Target, other U.S. breaches may spur security spending -executives","By Ross Kerber BOSTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - A rash of data breaches at big U.S. retailers may accelerate spending on high-tech payment cards, a MasterCard Inc executive and other industry specialists said on Monday, as companies look to keep the faith of their customers. Retailers and their banks face a deadline set by payment networks Visa Inc and MasterCard of October 2015 to accept new payment cards that store information on computer chips rather than on traditional magnetic stripes. The multibillion-dollar safety upgrade has many companies dragging their feet, and analysts estimated only 60 percent of U.S. sales terminals would meet the schedule.

The risks created by the breaches will clarify to companies the benefit of moving quickly to the new standard, she said. “That’s the clarity,” she said. Among companies that could profit from a faster switch to chip-based cards are those that make equipment used to swipe them, such as the United States’ VeriFone Systems Inc  and France’s Ingenico. MasterCard, of Purchase, N.Y., is the second-largest payment network operator behind Visa of Foster City, California. Visa has not made executives available to be interviewed since Target first reported its breach on Dec. 19. A response gaining attention among security specialists has been the conversion of U.S. sales terminals to a card standard widely used in Europe and Asia, sometimes known as “EMV” after the initials of its creator companies Europay, MasterCard and Visa. Cards meeting the standard carry chips to make them harder to counterfeit, and to protect sensitive data with encryption. They can also require users to enter a personal identification number, or PIN, to make purchases, an extra layer of security compared to the signatures used by traditional credit cards. Although the new technology may not have prevented the data thefts from Target and elsewhere, it would make any stolen data harder to re-use and has cut fraud where it has been adopted. In an interview with CNBC on Monday, Target Chief Executive Gregg Steinhafel said the company wanted to lead the retail industry’s move to adopt the new cards. His remarks echoed those made by the general counsel of the National Retail Federation on Sunday.

The cost of switching would have to cover new sales terminals and the issuing of new plastic to replace the roughly 1.1 billion credit, debit and prepaid cards now circulating in the United States. A traditional card costs about $1 to print, personalize and mail to a consumer, whereas the new cards can cost up to $10 each depending on the volume printed and the memory in their chips, estimated Javelin Strategy analyst Al Pascual.

194,V,Target data breach could be costly for payment partners,"BOSTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Companies that help Target Corp  process payments could face millions of dollars in fines and costs resulting from the unprecedented data breach that struck the retailer over the holiday shopping season. Investigators are still sorting through just how thieves  compromised about 40 million payment cards and the information of about 70 million Target customers. But people who have reviewed past data breaches believe Target’s partners could face consumer lawsuits and fines that payment networks such as  Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc often levy after cyber security incidents. Target’s partners “have deep pockets and are intimately involved in certain aspects of how Target gets paid,” said Jamie Pole, a cyber security consultant in Asheboro, North Carolina, who works for government agencies and the financial industry. Fines and settlement costs could reach into the millions of dollars for individual companies, he said, though much will depend on how the ultimate liability for the breach is determined. Boston attorney Cynthia Larose of Mintz Levin said Target would likely seek to add its partners as defendants to lawsuits already filed over the breach. “These class-action lawsuits start to bring everyone in at some point,” she said. After its systems were penetrated by hackers in the mid-2000s, retailer TJX Companies Inc agreed to pay up to $40.9 million to cover fraud costs in a settlement with Visa. Visa also issued penalties of $880,000 against Fifth Third Bancorp of Ohio, which processed transactions for TJX. Asked about the business relationships and possible costs, Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder declined to comment, citing the ongoing investigation and pending suits. A Visa spokeswoman declined to comment. A MasterCard spokesman said the company could not discuss an ongoing investigation. Several companies are involved in any purchase from a store such as Target. A bank issues the consumer’s payment card, while a separate organization known as the “merchant acquirer” handles the payment for the store, when the card is swiped. Companies such as Visa and MasterCard operate the networks over which the payment request and confirmation are sent. Companies performing these roles for Target were identified in a research note by Robert W. Baird & Co analysts on Dec. 19. According to the note the merchant acquirer used by Target for credit and debit card transactions is Bank of America Merchant Services, a joint venture of Bank of America Corp  and KKR & Co’s First Data Corp. A spokesman for the joint venture declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Bank of America. Bank of America is due to release earnings on Wednesday morning. A spokeswoman for First Data, Nancy Etheredge, said via email that the company “processes some transactions for one of Target’s merchant acquirers” but declined to offer more detail. The note also identified Vantiv Inc of Cincinnati as processing transactions for Target customers who type in personal identification numbers for debit transactions. It said Vantiv expected “no impact from the breach.” Vantiv representatives did not return messages. Target-branded payment cards are issued by Toronto’s TD Bank Group. A spokeswoman said via e-mail that “It would be inappropriate to comment on any potential fines at this time.” One author of the Baird report, analyst Timothy Wojs, said it is too soon to predict what fines or settlement costs might result. In the past, fines by Visa and MasterCard have been insignificant to payment processors but set the stage for larger settlements to cover bank losses, he said. Fines in cyber cases have drawn some push-back from merchants. In a case in U.S. District Court in Nashville, Tennessee, specialty retailer Genesco Inc Inc is suing Visa over the $13.3 million it says Visa wrongfully collected from its banks, Wells Fargo & Co and Fifth Third. Visa collected the money after a cyber-attack obtained payment data, though the data was handled within industry standards, according to the company’s complaint. Wells Fargo declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Fifth Third did not respond to questions. In court filings Visa defended its actions as in keeping with laws and contracts.",1152014,http://www.reuters.com/article/target-databreach-banks/target-data-breach-could-be-costly-for-payment-partners-idUSL2N0KO11020140115
195,V,"US STOCKS-S&P;, Nasdaq end down with Intel, GE; Dow gains","* Intel falls after results, outlook * American Express and Visa lead the Dow’s gainers * Morgan Stanley stock hits highest since 2009 after results * Dow up 0.3 pct, S&P; 500 off 0.4 pct, Nasdaq down 0.5 pct By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The S&P; 500 and Nasdaq declined on Friday as results from Intel and General Electric  were the latest to dampen the view on fourth-quarter earnings. Volatility picked up late in the session, thanks in part to selling related to options expiration, analysts said. Earnings season is still in the early phase, but S&P; 500 companies so far are beating analysts’ expectations at a rate that’s below what’s typical, according to Thomson Reuters data. Bucking the trend, the Dow ended higher - helped by a rally in American Express Co and Visa. AmEx jumped 3.6 percent to $90.97 a day after reporting quarterly results. Intel’s stock slid 2.6 percent to $25.85 and was among the top weights on each of the three major U.S. stock indexes, a day after the chipmaker gave a lukewarm forecast for first-quarter revenue and posted fourth-quarter earnings that missed expectations by a penny. General Electric shares dropped 2.3 percent to $26.58 after the conglomerate reported disappointing 2013 profit margins. But at least some of the day’s move could have been options related. “January options expiration tends to be among the most volatile, and today’s an example of that,” said Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategist of Delta Global Asset Management in Boston. “Money managers typically take their most aggressive picks during the first part of the year, and a lot of options strategies are involved in those picks.” The Dow Jones industrial average rose 41.55 points or 0.25 percent, to end at 16,458.56. The S&P; 500 fell 7.19 points or 0.39 percent, to finish at 1,838.70. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 21.107 points or 0.50 percent, to 4,197.582. For the week, the Dow rose 0.13 percent, the S&P; 500 slipped 0.20 percent and the Nasdaq gained 0.55 percent. With earnings from 10 percent of the S&P; 500 companies so far, 50 percent have exceeded expectations, below the historical average of 63 percent for a full season, Thomson Reuters data showed. “The market was teased in a good way by some of the first earnings, tempered later with disappointing numbers, and it’s trying to make a sense of what the quarter is going to be,” said John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in New York. Visa shares jumped 4.7 percent to close at $232.18. A U.S. appeals judge appeared to side with the Federal Reserve over a group of retailers in a dispute over the level of fees set by the Fed on the use of debit cards. Among other gainers, Morgan Stanley rose 4.4 percent to $33.40 after previously hitting $33.52, its highest since November 2009. The bank reported a sharp drop in quarterly profit as it was hit by legal bills, but adjusted earnings beat estimates. U.S.-listed shares of Deutsche Bank fell 3 percent to $52.27 after a Wall Street Journal report that the largest German bank is considering a profit warning as executives believe its upcoming quarterly results will be below investors’ expectations. The Dow Jones Transportation Average slipped 0.4 percent. Shares of United Parcel Service Inc fell 0.6 percent to $99.91 and the stock of Con-Way dropped 2 percent to $40.59 after fourth-quarter outlooks. After the S&P; 500’s 30 percent surge in 2013, largely due to stimulus from the Federal Reserve, the benchmark index started the year on a weak note. But the S&P; 500 recovered recently to set a record closing high on Wednesday. The economy, expected to show further signs of recovery as the Fed slowly withdraws its stimulus, gave reassuring signs. Data showed U.S. industrial output rose at its fastest clip in 3-1/2 years in the fourth quarter as factory activity closed out the year on a strong note. Volume was above the average for the month. About 6.8 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the average of 6.6 billion so far this month, according to data from BATS Global Markets. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the New York Stock Exchange by a ratio of about 3 to 2.

196,V,Exclusive: Cybercrime firm says uncovers six active attacks on U.S. merchants,"BOSTON (Reuters) - A cybercrime firm says it has uncovered at least six ongoing attacks at U.S. merchants whose credit card processing systems are infected with the same type of malicious software used to steal data from Target Corp. Andrew Komarov, chief executive of the cybersecurity firm IntelCrawler, told Reuters that his company has alerted law enforcement, Visa Inc and intelligence teams at several large banks about the findings. He said payment card data was stolen in the attacks, though he didn’t know how much. IntelCrawler’s findings are the latest sign that the cyberattacks disclosed by Target Inc and upscale department store Neiman Marcus are part of a wider assault on U.S. retailer customer data security. On Thursday, the U.S. government and the private security intelligence firm iSIGHT Partners warned merchants and financial services firms that the BlackPOS software used against No. 3 U.S. retailer Target had been used in a string of other breaches at retailers - but did not say how many or identify the victims. Credit card companies, banks and retailers say that victims of any fraud resulting from the theft of their payment card data bear “zero liability” and will be credited for fraudulent purchases made on their accounts. “Our rules say five days, but most consumers get (their money) back within 24 hours,” Visa spokeswoman Rosetta Jones said. Yet consumer advocates said that any debit card fraud could result in money being drained from a bank, mutual fund or other cash account at a time when those funds were really needed. “Even if you are able to recover the money later, that’s going to cause you an awful lot of pain and heartburn,” said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, a nonprofit advocacy group. Data breaches can also be costly for the retailers and credit card firms affected, along with the companies that process the payments, people who have reviewed past attacks say. Komarov, an expert on cybercrime who has helped law enforcement investigate previous attacks, told Reuters on Friday that retailers in California and New York were among those compromised by BlackPOS. Reuters was unable to confirm their names. Komarov said he has not directly contacted those merchants. Security experts typically report cybercrimes through law enforcement rather than going directly to victims because the process can be time-consuming and victims are often suspicious when they first learn of attacks. BlackPOS was developed by a hacker whose nickname is “Ree4” and who is now about 17 years old and living in St. Petersburg, Russia, according to Los Angeles-based IntelCrawler. The teenager sold the malicious software to cybercriminals who then launched attacks on merchants, said Komarov, who has been monitoring Ree4’s activities since March. Komarov declined to specifically identify the sources of his intelligence, though he said he has been monitoring criminal forums where Ree4 sells his software and posted an excerpt of a chat with a client on the IntelCrawler website. Officials with the Russian Interior Ministry could not be reached for comment when Reuters attempted to contact them after office hours on Friday. The bulk of the attacks have occurred in the United States, but about 30 percent have occurred in other countries, including Australia and Canada, Komarov said. Target last month disclosed the theft of some 40 million payment card numbers in a breach uncovered over the holiday shopping season, and later reported that 70 million customers’ records had also been taken. Neiman Marcus last week said that it too was victim of a cyberattack. Sources have told Reuters that at least three other well-known national retailers have been attacked. John Watters, chief executive of iSIGHT Partners, which is helping the U.S. Secret Service with its investigation into the attacks, said that he expects the pace of assaults on merchants to pick up. Copycats will pile on, using similar software, which can be purchased on underground forums, and similar techniques to launch attacks on retailers, he said. “They are saying: ‘This is a great idea.’” BlackPOS is a type of RAM scraper, or memory-parsing software, which enables cybercriminals to grab encrypted data by capturing it when it travels through the live memory of a computer, where it appears in plain text. It is derived from code that has been floating around underground cybercrime forums since at least 2005 and may be related to malicious software used in attacks as early as 2003, said Shane Shook, an executive with cybersecurity firm Cylance Inc who has helped investigate major breaches at retailers. While the technology has been around for many years, its use has increased as retailers have improved their security, making it more difficult for hackers to obtain credit card data using other approaches. It succeeded in evading detection by anti-virus software when it infected the Windows-based point-of-sales terminals at retailers like Target, according to the report that the government privately distributed to merchants on Thursday, which iSIGHT Partners helped prepare. Officials with the Secret Service could not immediately be reached for comment.

Shares of Intel Corp slid 3.5 percent to $25.60 and weighed on each of the three major U.S. stock indexes a day after the chipmaker’s fourth-quarter earnings missed expectations by a penny due to weak spending on servers. Intel gave a lukewarm forecast for first-quarter revenue. General Electric Co shares dropped 2.6 percent to $26.49. The conglomerate reported a slightly better-than-expected increase in revenue on Friday, propelled by its businesses selling oil pumps and jet engines. Bucking the session’s slight downtrend was American Express Co, which reported quarterly results late on Thursday. Its strong numbers also boosted its peer Visa. Both were the top gainers in the Dow Jones industrial average, which outperformed the S&P; 500 and the Nasdaq. AmEx shares jumped 4.7 percent to $91.88. Visa gained 3.2 percent to $228.80. As earnings continue to trickle in, analysts expect the market to get more clarity on the strength of Corporate America and look for leadership to define the next move. “The market was teased in a good way by some of the first earnings, tempered later with disappointing numbers, and it’s trying to make a sense of what the quarter is going to be,” said John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in New York.

Data showed U.S. industrial output rose at its fastest clip in 3-1/2 years in the fourth quarter as factory activity closed out the year on a strong note. Monthly housing starts posted their largest percentage decline since April, but were coming off a six-year high reached in November, and the decline was smaller than economists had expected. The PHLX housing sector index lost 1.2 percent. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan’s preliminary reading on the consumer sentiment index slipped to 80.4 from 82.5 in December, weighed by lowered expectations among lower- and middle-income families.

Banks and retailers have been dragging their feet over the upgrade and have been at odds over who should bear the cost, which experts have said could be as much as $10 billion. Visa and MasterCard Inc have been pushing for merchants and issuers to meet an October 2015 target date to accept cards with an embedded chip to hold information, rather than rely on the easily copied magnetic strips. Analysts have estimated that only 60 percent of U.S. point-of-sale terminals would meet the target date. “Unfortunately many merchants and issuers and both of their lobbyists are attempting to assign blame in the press and not reacting in a particularly constructive manner,” Charlie Scharf said in a post-earnings conference call. “It is in all of our best interest that change quickly.” Last month Target Corp, the third-largest U.S. retailer, said about 40 million credit card records and 70 million other records containing data on its customers were stolen in a security breach. Luxury retail chain Neiman Marcus and Michaels Cos Inc, the biggest U.S. arts and crafts retailer, have said they were victims of cyber attacks. Most Americans have been victims of data theft, but that hasn’t stopped them from using credit cards and social media sites or shopping online, according to a Ipsos/Reuters poll of 8,308 Americans. About 64 percent of the victims said the experience had not deterred them from using their credit or debit cards. Visa, the world’s largest credit and debit card company, reported a better-than-expected rise in quarterly profit as more people used cards instead of cash to make payments. Net income attributable to Visa rose 9 percent to $1.41 billion, or $2.20 per Class A share, in the first quarter from $1.29 billion, or $1.93, a year earlier. Total operating revenue increased 11 percent to $3.16 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $2.16 per share on revenue of $3.13 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Foster City, California-based Visa said total volume grew about 7 percent to $1.84 trillion, helped by a strong holiday shopping in the United States. Visa shares were up 2 percent at $221.80 in morning trading on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. MasterCard shares were also up 2 percent at $79.19.

In 2013, JPMorgan Chase & Co, which issues both MasterCard and Visa-branded cards, signed a 10-year agreement under which the bank will commit more credit and debit card transaction volumes to Visa. “We don’t have any specifics on how these cards will migrate, but we are now assuming an impact in 2014. Given the size of this portfolio we can offset some, but not all, of this attrition with our wins,” MasterCard Chief Financial Officer Martina Hund-Mejean said on a post-earnings conference call. MasterCard shares were down 5 percent at $75.98 in late-morning trading. They fell as much as 10 percent. The company had forecast net revenue growth of between 11 and 14 percent for the period between 2013 and 2015. MasterCard reported a 21.1 percent rise in operating expenses at $1.21 billion as the company set aside $95 million for litigation settlements. The company also saw its rebates and incentives it offers to customers increase 23 percent to $925 million as it signed up more business. In the fourth quarter, MasterCard signed an agreement with pan-African bank Ecobank Group and also extended its agreement with U.K.-based Tesco Bank. MasterCard also renewed its agreement with Bank of Montreal. MasterCard joined its larger rival, Visa, in urging U.S. merchants and banks to hasten the adoption of a more secure technology for credit and debit cards after security breaches at several retailers. “What we would now like to see is that all players within the payments ecosystem come together with a sense of urgency to ensure that the highest payment security standards are put into place,” MasterCard Chief Executive Ajay Banga said. MasterCard’s net income rose 3 percent to $623 million, or 52 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, from a year earlier. Adjusted earnings were 57 cents per share, below the average analyst estimate of 60 cents. Net revenue rose 12 percent to $2.13 billion. Analysts on average had expected $2.14 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. MasterCard’s worldwide purchase volume increased 11 percent to $805 billion from a year earlier, while annual growth in its U.S. purchase volumes rose 7.4 percent to $275 billion. The company announced a 10-for-1 stock split and raised its quarterly dividend by 83 percent last month. Shares of MasterCard have risen 66 percent in the 12 months ended December, outperforming the broader S&P; 500 Index  which rose 30 percent in the year.

202,V,"MasterCard, Visa form group to push for better card security","(Reuters) - Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc said they had launched a cross-industry group to improve security for card transactions and press U.S. retailers and banks to meet a 2015 deadline to adopt technology that would make it safer to pay with plastic. The move follows several data breaches at U.S. retailers, including one at Target Corp late last year involving the theft of about 40 million credit and debit card records. The new group - which includes banks, credit unions, retailers and industry trade associations - will initially focus on the adoption of ‘EMV’ chip technology, MasterCard and Visa said in a statement on Friday. EMV cards, already used in Europe and Asia, store information on computer chips rather than on traditional magnetic strips, making them harder to counterfeit. They can also require - depending on the issuer - that users enter a personal identification number, or PIN, to make purchases, adding an extra layer of security. However, the National Retail Federation, the world’s largest retail trade association, said it had not joined the group because there were no plans to immediately implement the PIN option, making for a “half-baked solution.” “They’re not serious about reducing fraud, unless they put a pin on,” said Mallory Duncan, the NRF’s general counsel. “We remain insistent that U.S. retailers’ customers be given the same protections as consumers in more than 80 countries who have both a chip and a PIN securing their credit and debit cards,” Duncan said in a statement. Visa and MasterCard declined to provide details on specific proposals for the technology to be used in the cards or the make-up of the cross-industry group. The American Bankers Association did not respond to requests for comment but Patrick Keefe, a spokesman for the Credit Union National Association, confirmed that the trade association was part of the industry group. “The recent high-profile breaches have served as a catalyst for much needed collaboration between the retail and financial services industry on the issue of payment security,” Visa President Ryan McInerney said in the statement. MasterCard and Visa had already set a deadline of October 2015 for U.S. retailers to adopt the new payment technology. “Probably about 80 percent plus of the larger retailers were going to be able to make the deadline anyways,” said David Robertson, publisher of payment industry newsletter The Nilson Report. Robertson said the formation of the group would help push small and mid-size retailers to adopt the new technology. Banks and retailers have been dragging their feet over the upgrade, at odds over how the costs would be split. The NRF has said it could cost the U.S. retail industry about $30 billion to upgrade to chip-based cards, including equipment, training and software. “Banks and retailers want to make sure that if they invest in new infrastructure, they’ll get the return in reduced fraud,” Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria told Reuters. MasterCard and Visa said the group would also address security issues with mobile and online transactions.

206,V,"Coming to a store near you: UnionPay, the world's biggest bankcard","SHANGHAI, March 12 (Reuters) - In UnionPay’s curved glass headquarters in Shanghai’s financial hub of Pudong, a plaque commemorates a visit by former Chinese President Hu Jintao in 2010. Emblazoned on it is a quote from Hu urging the company to “step up the effort to internationalize and strive to build UnionPay into a major global brand for bankcards”. China’s renminbi currency is not yet an international currency - it is not freely convertible. Yet China’s official bank card has achieved Hu’s dream of global dominance. China UnionPay has become the world’s largest card brand with 3.53 billion cards in circulation, just over a decade after it was founded in 2002. Its $2.5 trillion in transactions in the first half of last year was second to Visa Inc’s $4.6 trillion, says industry newsletter the Nilson Report. UnionPay has achieved this kind of dominance by having a virtual monopoly on bank card transactions in China, and according to its rivals, offering low fees to retail merchants at home and abroad. In China, foreign rivals such as American Express, MasterCard Inc and Visa must use UnionPay’s yuan settlement network. Credit and debit card settlement is a big, profitable and growing business in China. Interbank card transactions jumped 37 percent from 2011 to 21.8 trillion yuan ($3.58 trillion) in 2012. Central bank regulations also give UnionPay the rights to settlements for all online transactions in China. UnionPay transactions overseas show equally impressive growth, rising 30 percent year-on-year in 2012, according to the official Xinhua news agency. Overseas revenue now accounts for around 5 percent of UnionPay’s total, according to a Hong Kong fund manager briefed by UnionPay executives. UnionPay, which is not a public company, does not disclose financial results or details. The United States, home to UnionPay’s biggest rivals, has complained long and often about its privileged status in China. In 2012, following complaints by Washington, the World Trade Organization ordered China to stop discriminating against foreign bank card rivals such as Visa and Mastercard, but did not make any specific recommendations. “A more efficient payment card system in China would be more beneficial for both merchants and consumers,” U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said at the time. China has yet to open the bank card market. UnionPay regularly waives fees that its rivals charge and is known for having the lowest fees in the market overseas, said the head of bank card operations at a Hong Kong-based bank who deals regularly with UnionPay. “It seems they’re at an expansion phase, so anything goes,” said the executive. “They don’t mind losing money to gain market share. Visa and Mastercard don’t offer anything like that.” “When we asked (UnionPay), ‘Are your international operations making a loss?’ We were told: We don’t look at those numbers,” he added. UnionPay said in a written response to questions about this assertion that its overseas operations were profitable. “UnionPay’s international business growth momentum remains good, and at the moment, it remains in a profitable state,” the company said. Third-party installers such as EasyLink have helped  UnionPay’s expansion by installing its terminals in overseas retail stores. Merchants are eager for them: Chinese are now the world’s largest consumers of luxury goods.",3122014,http://www.reuters.com/article/china-unionpay-expansion/coming-to-a-store-near-you-unionpay-the-worlds-biggest-bankcard-idUSL3N0JR18520140312
207,V,Top Russians close to Putin targeted in EU/U.S. visa bans: German paper,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Visa bans threatened by the European Union and United States should Crimea vote to join Russia in a referendum would target at least 13 Russian politicians and industry leaders including Vladimir Putin’s close aides, Germany’s Bild newspaper reported. The visa ban list includes Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, head of the presidential administration Sergei Ivanov, the secretary of the National Security Council Nikolai Patrushev, as well as several of Putin’s advisors, Bild said in an advance copy of a report to be published on Saturday. The report cited diplomatic sources in Brussels and Washington. Visa bans could also be slapped on the chief executive of Russian energy firm Gazprom Alexei Miller, and Igor Sechin, head of Russia’s top crude oil producer Rosneft.

208,V,UPDATE 3-Russian sanctions ripple through corporate boardrooms,"* German companies say orders falling, business uncertain * Danish authorities brief 130 Danish companies on Russian situation * Visa and MasterCard halt services to clients of 2 Russian banks * Banks very cautious after getting into sanctions trouble in the past   (Adds Bombardier’s doubts over deal with Russia’s Rostec) By Eric Matzen and Michelle Martin COPENHAGEN/FRANKFURT, March 21 (Reuters) - A deepening economic standoff between Russia and the West over the future of Ukraine has rippled through trading floors and boardrooms, with exporters scrambling to protect revenues and some global financial firms halting services. U.S. President Barack Obama’s threat to target major sections of the Russian economy should President Vladimir Putin follow up his annexation of Crimea with further incursions in Ukraine has caused alarm in Europe. Denmark’s foreign ministry held a special briefing for about 130 companies, including drugs firm Novo Nordisk and brewer Carlsberg on Friday after being inundated with inquiries about the business implications of the crisis. In an email to Reuters, Carlsberg’s chief executive said he was monitoring the situation closely and would act if sanctions had a direct impact on his drinks group’s business. The company produces and sells local beers in both Ukraine and Russia. “Until now it has been business as usual. We produce, sell and distribute our products to the market without problems,” said CEO Jorgen Buhl Rasmussen. “Our focus is on our employees and our breweries.” Lemken, a German manufacturer of ploughs and other farm machinery, has seen a big drop-off in orders from Russia, its second-biggest export market after France, in recent weeks as a sliding rouble raises their sale price. With Moscow vowing to retaliate against the West’s sanctions, Anthony van der Ley, managing director of the family-run business, is taking no chances. He is sending machinery to Russia now in case the border closes or import charges are hiked. Profine, a plastic windowframe manufacturer with annual revenues of 700 million euros ($965 million), has so far managed to compensate for the rouble slide by increasing sales but won’t be able to do that forever. “If there are further sanctions, that would be poison for the economic development of our partners,” said Peter Mrosik, the German firm’s managing partner. In Canada, Bombardier Inc said the airplane maker’s planned joint-venture with Rostec, the Russian state-owned industrial and defense conglomerate, was likely to be delayed because of sanctions being considered by Canada and other Western countries. A related deal for Bombardier to sell 100 short-haul Q400 NextGen aircraft was also likely to be held up. Obama unveiled sanctions against members of Putin’s inner circle on Thursday as well as against Bank Rossiya, partly owned by a Putin ally. In response, Visa and MasterCard, both based in the United States, stopped providing services for clients at Rossiya and another bank SMP, whose co-owners, two brothers, are also on Obama’s list. Western Union Co, the world’s largest money transfer company, said it had suspended services through Bank Rossiya branches but was continuing services at more than 20,000 locations and self-service terminals in Russia. SMP described the move by Visa and MasterCard as unlawful.  However, financial services firms are wary of doing business with any person or group that can be linked back to the targets. Banks have paid dearly in the past for violating U.S. sanctions on countries such as Iran. What bankers and business people fear is an escalation of measures that would choke off international payments and trade, halt investments and stymie deals. Germany’s main trade body warned on Friday that full-blown economic sanctions would be a “real catastrophe”. In a worst-case scenario, Washington would stop banks doing business with Russian counterparts and corporates, similar to the sort of sanctions that were imposed on Iran. Germany’s “wise men” council of economic advisers said this week that the Ukraine crisis was the biggest threat to growth globally, and especially in Germany, because of Russia’s importance as an energy exporter. “What has been announced so far is really nothing. It’s purely cosmetic,” said a French banker based in Moscow. “The biggest risk is tougher sanctions and really the potential impossibility of transfers in U.S. dollars,” said the banker, who declined to be named because of official sensitivity around the restrictions. Bank exposure to Russia link.reuters.com/xej67v Russia's main trade partners link.reuters.com/jup77v Russia's EU trade ties link.reuters.com/rup77v State-owned Russian banks and companies are expected to repatriate funds from overseas after Putin told them this week to bring their assets home. But foreign bankers in Russia said things would have to deteriorate further before they would reconsider their investments there. “It would have to be a lot worse than this. We are waiting for the response from the Russian side,” said a Western banker in Moscow. “I haven’t heard of any Western companies pulling out of Russia,” the banker added. Even before the Crimean crisis blew up last month, international banks such as HSBC, Credit Suisse  and Barclays had pulled out of dozens of markets because the risk of falling foul of financial crime rules and sanctions outweighed the returns. The cost to banks of cleaning up an array of misdeeds that have come to light since the global financial crisis, including sanctions busting, has soared to over $100 billion. Since the U.S. and European sanctions so far focused on wealthy individuals close to Putin, private banks which cater to powerful Russians are under the spotlight. Switzerland, the global hub for private banking and a bolt-hole for wealthy Russians, has yet to impose any restrictions but its banks, such as UBS and Credit Suisse, still have to be aware of sanctions when they deal with clients. Vasili Brokvo, the head of communications for Russia’s state defence conglomerate Rostec, made the corporate case for peace. “We hope and our international partners also hope that political differences over certain issues won’t annul or destroy everything we’ve built and all previous agreements with foreign partners will be successfully implemented,” he said on a business trip to Chile this week.

209,V,"WRAPUP 6-Putin completes Crimea's annexation, Russia investors take fright","(Adds Rice comment, Canada sanctions, Moscow excludes OSCE from Crimea) * Kremlin to respond to U.S. sanctions in kind * Russian stocks plunge as investors fear wider sanctions * Visa, MasterCard stop processing payments for Russian bank * Europe looks to diversify from Russian gas, oil * EU signs deal with Ukraine, pledges financial help By Steve Gutterman and Adrian Croft MOSCOW/BRUSSELS, March 21 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin signed laws completing Russia’s annexation of Crimea on Friday as investors took fright at a U.S. decision to slap sanctions on his inner circle of money men and security officials. Putin promised to protect a bank partly owned by an old ally, which Washington has blacklisted, and his spokesman said  Russia would respond in kind to the latest financial and visa curbs after producing one blacklist of its own. His allies laughed off the U.S. sanctions, but shares on the Moscow stock exchange - which have lost $70 billion of their value this month - fell sharply after President Barack Obama also threatened to target major sectors of the economy if Russia moved on areas of Ukraine beyond the Black Sea peninsula. Obama’s national security adviser said the world was reassessing its relationship with Russia and Washington was sceptical of Russian assurances that troop movements on the Ukraine border were no more than military exercises. The financial noose began tightening with Visa and MasterCard stopping processing payments for a Russian bank owned by two brothers on the U.S. blacklist. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said Russia might cancel its foreign borrowing for 2014 and raise less domestically if the cost of issuing debt rose. European Union leaders - who like Obama insist Crimea is still part of Ukraine - imposed their own sanctions on 12 people, including Russian deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin and two aides to Putin. Canada sanctioned 14 people. Shaken by the worst East-West crisis since the Cold War, the EU also pledged to cut its reliance on Russian energy and signed a political deal with the pro-Western Ukrainians who took power after Moscow-backed President Viktor Yanukovich’s overthrow last month. In a Kremlin ceremony shown live on state television, Putin signed a law on ratification of a treaty making Crimea part of Russia and another creating two new Russian administrative districts: Crimea and the port city of Sevastopol, where Moscow keeps part of its Black Sea fleet. Thousands of Russians marked the annexation with fireworks and celebrations in Simferopol, capital of Crimea where the  population is around 58 percent ethnic Russian. “Many people wanted this, to go back, not to the USSR, but to that big country of ours,” said Anna Zevetseva, 32. “We are waiting for things to improve and for investment from Russia.” Ukrainian and Tatar residents stayed behind closed doors. Sergey, a 64-year-old Ukrainian businessman who did not want to give his surname, saw no reason to celebrate. “An occupying force is in my country and we have been annexed,” he said. A referendum last Sunday after Russian troops seized control of Crimea overwhelmingly backed union with Russia but was denounced by Washington and the European Union as a sham. It opened the way for annexation within a week. The OSCE European rights and security body finally agreed to send monitors to Ukraine after a delay Western members blamed on Russia, but Moscow said it would have no mandate in Crimea. Obama’s decision to target people who accompanied Putin’s rise from the mayor’s office in St Petersburg in the 1990s to the Russian presidency deepened the diplomatic confrontation. Putin said Bank Rossiya, singled out by Washington as the personal bank for senior Russian officials, had nothing to do with events in Crimea. The St Petersburg-based bank - which is chaired and partly owned by Yuri Kovalchuk, an old associate of Putin’s - mainly serves clients in Russia’s energy sector including businesses owned by state-run gas producer Gazprom. Putin, who says Crimea has exercised its right to self-determination, promised to transfer his wages to Bank Rossiya. “I personally don’t have an account there, but I certainly will open one on Monday,” he told Russia’s Security Council. Others on the U.S. blacklist include oil and commodities trader Gennady Timchenko and the brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, who are linked to big contracts on gas pipelines and the Sochi Olympics, as well as Putin’s chief of staff and his deputy, the head of military intelligence and a railways chief. European leaders also agreed to accelerate their quest for more secure energy supplies at talks on Friday. The EU has made progress in diversifying since crises in 2006 and 2009, when rows over unpaid bills between Kiev and Moscow led to the disruption of gas exports to western Europe.  But Russia still provides around a third of the EU’s oil and gas and 40 percent of the gas goes through Ukraine. European Council President Herman Van Rompuy said member states would help one another to maintain supplies if Moscow cut them. “We are serious about reducing our energy dependency,” he told a news conference at the end of a summit in Brussels. EU countries, which buy Russian gas individually, will also look to negotiate supply deals jointly with Moscow to increase their bargaining power. “It is clear we need to be moving towards an energy union,” said Van Rompuy. German Chancellor Angela Merkel raised the possibility that U.S. shale gas could eventually be an option for European countries seeking to diversify. Obama is expected to address the issue at a summit with EU leaders next Wednesday. Foreign banks and companies now fear the secondary ripple effects of the sanctions. In a worst-case scenario for them, Washington would stop banks doing business with Russian clients, similar to the sanctions that were imposed on Iran. “What has been announced so far is really nothing. It’s purely cosmetic,” said a French banker based in Moscow, adding that the biggest risk was to transfers in U.S. dollars, crucial for the energy export-dependent Russian economy. Obama said on Thursday that Washington was also considering sanctions against economic sectors including financial services, oil and gas, metals and mining and the defence industry, if Russia made military moves into eastern and southern Ukraine. In Crimea itself, Ukrainian troops who have been surrounded by Russian forces continued to leave their bases, powerless to halt Moscow’s takeover of the peninsula. “The situation in Ukraine remains unstable and menacing,” said German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, urging the OSCE observers to take up their work as quickly as possible. European governments also took individual action against Russia. Germany suspended approval of all defence-related exports to Russia, ordering contractor Rheinmetall to halt delivery of combat simulation gear, while France called off military cooperation with Moscow. In Brussels, the 28 EU leaders underlined their support for Ukraine’s new leadership, signing a political agreement with interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatseniuk. They also promised financial aid for the government - rejected as illegitimate by Moscow - as soon as Kiev reaches a deal with the International Monetary Fund. The IMF is to report next Tuesday on advanced talks with Ukraine on a loan programme that would be linked to far-reaching reforms of the shattered economy. Three months of protests were set off by Yanukovich’s refusal to sign an association agreement with the EU, the political part of which was signed on Friday. Russia’s MICEX stock index fell about 3 percent when trade opened, although it recovered some of the losses later. Promsvyazbank analyst Oleg Shagov said Obama had “opened a Pandora’s box full of sanctions”, with future sanctions to be “directed against whole sectors of the Russian economy”. Negative market sentiment was reinforced by warnings from credit ratings agencies Fitch and S&P; that they were changing their outlooks on Russia to negative from stable because of the possible impact of sanctions on Russia’s economy and business climate. Both agencies presently rate Russia BBB. Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev made clear that Russia would step up financial pressure on Ukraine. He said the former Soviet republic should repay Moscow $11 billion under a gas supply contract that should be scrapped because it no longer applied.

210,V,"Businesses fear ripple effects from ""cosmetic"" Russian sanctions","PARIS/MOSCOW, March 21 (Reuters) - U.S. and European sanctions against Russia are already having a ripple effect beyond their immediate targets, with Visa and MasterCard  halting payment transaction services for clients of a bank not even on the blacklist. SMP bank’s co-owners are two of the 20 Russians targeted by U.S. President Barack Obama as he tries to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for annexing Crimea. The lender described the move by Visa and MasterCard as unlawful. However, financial services firms are wary of doing business with any person or group that can be linked back to Obama’s blacklist. Banks have paid dearly in the past for violating U.S. sanctions on countries such as Iran, and the threat of broader measures against the Russian economy should Putin threaten southern and eastern Ukraine reinforces their caution. The U.S. sanctions forced Russian billionaire Gennady Timchenko to sell his nearly 50 percent stake in Gunvor, the world’s fourth-largest oil trader, this week but their direct effect has generally been relatively minor so far. What bankers and business people fear is an escalation of measures that would choke off international payments and trade, halt investments and stymie deals.

The cost to banks of cleaning up an array of misdeeds that have come to light since the global financial crisis, including sanctions busting, has soared to over $100 billion. With that figure expected to climb, Western banks have so far steered clear of attempts by Iran to get them involved in financing humanitarian transactions, despite a diplomatic thaw. With the U.S. and European sanctions so far focused on wealthy individuals close to Putin, private banks which cater to powerful Russians are under the spotlight. Switzerland, the centre of international private banking and a bolt-hole for wealthy Russians, has yet to impose any sanctions but its banks, such as UBS and Credit Suisse, still have to be aware of sanctions when they deal with clients. Beyond banking, big companies such as AstraZeneca  have said they are monitoring the situation in Russia, while doubts are growing over whether smaller firms with less financial flexibility should push ahead with investments in Russia such as building factories. “They are in a wait-and-see mode.

215,V,WRAPUP 3-NATO commander warns of Russian threat to separatist Moldova region,"(Adds Schaeuble quote, G7 to meet on Monday) * NATO commander warns of threat to Transdniestria * Says Russian force on Ukraine border is “very, very sizeable and very, very ready” * Russian ambassador to EU says Russia has no expansionist views * U.S. Senator John McCain draws parallel between Putin and Hitler * Russian bank SMP says Visa, MasterCard resume processing payments By Adrian Croft and Aleksandar Vasovic BRUSSELS/FEODOSIA, Ukraine, March 23 (Reuters) - NATO’s top military commander said on Sunday Russia had built up a “very sizeable” force on its border with Ukraine and Moscow may have a region in another ex-Soviet republic, Moldova, in its sights after annexing Crimea. Russia was acting more like an adversary than a partner, NATO’s Supreme Allied Commander Europe, U.S. Air Force General Philip Breedlove said, and the 28-nation alliance should rethink the positioning and readiness of its forces in eastern Europe. Russian troops, using armoured vehicles, automatic weapons and stun grenades, seized some of the last military facilities under Ukrainian control on Saturday in Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula that Russian President Vladimir Putin formally annexed the day before. Breedlove was one of several Western officials and politicians to warn on Sunday that Russia may not stop there in a crisis that has taken East-West relations lurching back towards the Cold War since pro-Western protests in Ukraine ousted Moscow-allied President Viktor Yanukovich last month. “The (Russian) force that is at the Ukrainian border now to the east is very, very sizeable and very, very ready,” the NATO commander told an event held by the German Marshall Fund think-tank. U.S. President Barack Obama’s deputy national security adviser Tony Blinken said the build-up might just be aimed at intimidating Ukraine’s new pro-Western leaders but that Russia could invade the country’s mainly Russian-speaking east. “It’s possible that they are preparing to move in,” he told CNN. A meeting of the G7 group of industrialised nations has been hastily convened for Monday in the Netherlands to allow leaders to discuss a response to Russia’s actions. Obama will also meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov for bilateral talks. Russia said it was complying with international agreements and had no plans to invade. It has called the soldiers who took over Ukrainian bases in Crimea “self defence forces”. The United States and the European Union have targeted some of Putin’s closest political and business allies with personal sanctions and have threatened broader economic sanctions if Putin’s forces encroach on other eastern or southern parts of Ukraine with big Russian-speaking populations. Germany, which has close trade ties with Russia, said the European Union was united in its readiness to impose sanctions on Russia if necessary, and that Moscow had the most to lose. “None of us wants to escalate, but if Russia changes things unilaterally, then it must know that we won’t accept it and that relations will be bad,” Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told German television. Ukrainian marine standards were still flying on Sunday alongside the Russian flag at the Crimean base of Ukraine’s top military unit in Feodosia, but the Ukrainian troops were getting ready to leave after the Russian military takeover. “Our only issue is that we want to leave this place with honour, weapons and vehicles,” one Ukrainian soldier said. Blinken said Washington was considering all requests for military assistance from the government in Kiev, but that it would be unlikely to prevent an invasion of Ukraine, which is not part of NATO. Breedlove said the military alliance needed to think about its eastern members, particularly the former Soviet Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. “We need to think about our allies, the positioning of our forces in the alliance and the readiness of those forces ... such that we can be there to defend against it if required, especially in the Baltics and other places,” Breedlove said. Breedlove said NATO was very concerned about the threat to Transdniestria, which declared independence from Moldova in 1990 but has not been recognised by any United Nations member state. About 30 percent of its half million population is ethnic Russian and more than half of the total speak Russian as a mother tongue. Russia has 440 peacekeepers in Transdniestria plus other soldiers guarding Soviet-era arms stocks. It launched a new military exercise, involving 8,500 artillery men, near Ukraine’s eastern border 10 days ago. “There is absolutely sufficient (Russian) force postured on the eastern border of Ukraine to run to Transdniestria if the decision was made to do that, and that is very worrisome,” Breedlove said. The speaker of Transdniestria’s parliament has urged Russia to incorporate the region, which lies to the west of Ukraine. The new leaders in Kiev have said Moscow could seek to link up pro-Russian regions in Moldova, and Georgia to Ukraine’s east, in a destabilising southern corridor with Crimea in the middle. Russia’s Deputy Defence Minister Anatoly Antonov was quoted by the state’s Itar-Tass news agency as saying Russia was complying with international agreements limiting the number of troops near its border with Ukraine. Moscow’s ambassador to the European Union, Vladimir Chizhov,  said Russia did not have “expansionist views”. Asked to give a commitment that Russian troops would not move into Ukrainian territory outside Crimea, he told Britain’s BBC. “There is no intention of the Russian Federation to do anything like that.” U.S. Senator John McCain, a Republican foreign policy specialist, told the same BBC show that Putin’s actions in Ukraine were akin to those of Adolf Hitler in 1930s Germany. “I think he (Putin) is calculating how much he can get away with, just as Adolf Hitler calculated how much he could get away with in the 1930s,” McCain said. Germany’s Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier underscored the huge potential repercussions of Russia’s bid to redraw national borders in Europe. “I’m very worried the unlawful attempt to alter recognised borders in our European neighbourhood, 25 years after the end of the Cold War, will open Pandora’s Box,” he said. Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko, a close ally of Russia, accepted on Sunday that Crimea was now “de facto” a part of Russia, but said the annexation set a “bad precedent”. Western sanctions lost some of their sting on Sunday when Russia’s SMP bank, whose main shareholders were targeted by U.S. sanctions, said Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc had resumed payment services for its clients. The bank said it was glad the two biggest international payments systems had listened to its arguments to reverse Friday’s suspension of services as it was wrong to target the bank, which was not itself subject to any sanctions. Putin and Russian media had mocked the sanctions, which did not stop the Russian military completing its takeover of Ukraine’s military bases in Crimea. Russia’s defence ministry said on Sunday that its flag was now flying over 189 Ukrainian military installations on the peninsula. The EU emphasised its support for the new pro-Western government in Kiev, signing a political agreement with interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatseniuk last week. It also promised financial aid for the government - which Moscow says came to power by a coup to overthrow Yanukovich after he rejected an EU trade deal in favour of closer ties with Russia - as soon as Kiev reaches a deal with the International Monetary Fund. The IMF will report on Tuesday.

216,V,"UPDATE 1-Russian bank SMP says Visa, MasterCard resume payment services","(Adds Mastercard, Visa comment) MOSCOW, March 23 (Reuters) - Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc have resumed services for payment transactions for clients at Russia’s SMP bank, whose main shareholders were affected by U.S. sanctions, the bank said on Sunday. Washington imposed additional sanctions on Thursday against 20 Russians for involvement in the Ukraine crisis, including Boris Rotenberg and his older brother Arkady, who received large contracts for the Sochi Winter Olympics. They are co-owners of SMP Bank. SMP had said on Friday that Visa and MasterCard had stopped providing services for payment transactions for clients at SMP bank, which has about 100 branches covering more than 20 Russian cities, according to its website. A spokesperson for Mastercard confirmed it was again serving clients of the bank but did not say why it reversed its decision. Visa said it had been informed by the U.S. government to lift sanctions against SMP bank and two other Russian banks because they did not meet the criteria for sanctions. “All cards issued by these banks will return to normal operation as soon as possible,” it said in a statement. Visa’s statement named the other two banks as Investitsionny Soyuz (Investment Union) and InvestKapitalBank. SMP bank had said the decision to stop providing services by Visa and MasterCard was unlawful because the sanctions were imposed on shareholders, not the bank, which said it has no assets in the United States. “We are glad that the two biggest international payment systems have heard our arguments and reversed their decision to block (SMP bank transactions),” SMP bank CEO Dmitry Kalantyrsky, said in a statement.

218,V,"Russia renews plan for domestic alternative to Visa, Mastercard","MOSCOW, March 26 (Reuters) - Russia has revived plans to develop its own card payment system to cut its dependence on Visa and Mastercard after U.S. sanctions led to disruptions in their services, its finance minister said on Wednesday. Visa and MasterCard last week stopped providing services for payment transactions for clients at Bank Rossiya, which was hit by U.S. sanctions over Moscow’s involvement in a crisis in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea. The two payment systems also suspended services for clients at several other banks whose shareholders, but not the banks, are on the U.S. list. They resumed services after the U.S. government said these banks did not meet criteria for sanctions. “The payments restriction by Visa and Mastercard at one bank made us start thinking very seriously how we can secure ourselves against this kind of cases,” Anton Siluanov said in an interview on the Rossiya 24 channel. The “backup” national payment system would operate only on Russian territory, he said. Siluanov said the ministry and Russian banks were preparing proposals and these would be implemented in the near future. “Nevertheless, we believe that there is no serious reason to say that we should abandon the existing systems, especially Visa and Mastercard, but in parallel we will begin to focus more on developing our own settlement system,” he said. St Petersburg-based Bank Rossiya faces sanctions after being described by the United States as “the personal bank for senior officials” of Russia.

219,V,Wal-Mart sues Visa for $5 billion over card swipe fees,"(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc this week sued Visa Inc for $5 billion, accusing the credit and debit card network of excessively high card swipe fees, several months after the retailer opted out of a class action settlement between merchants and Visa and MasterCard Inc. Visa declined to comment on the suit, filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas, where Wal-Mart is headquartered. Visa and other card networks charge retailers fees, called swipe fees or interchange fees, each time a shopper uses a debit or credit card to pay. In December, a federal judge in Brooklyn, N.Y., approved a $5.7 billion class action settlement between merchants and Visa and MasterCard despite the objections of thousands of retailers that complained it was inadequate. Wal-Mart, Amazon.com Inc, and Target Corp were among those opting out of the monetary components of the settlement to have the freedom to seek damages on their own. Those businesses complained about a broad litigation release in the settlement. The release forces all merchants who accepted Visa or MasterCard, and those who will in the future, to give up their right to sue the credit card companies over rules at issue in the case or similar ones they may make in the future. Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, is seeking damages from price fixing and other antitrust violations that it claims took place between January 1, 2004 and November 27, 2012. In its lawsuit, Wal-Mart contends that Visa, in concert with banks, sought to prevent retailers from protecting themselves against those swipe fees, eventually hurting sales. “The anticompetitive conduct of Visa and the banks forced Wal-Mart to raise retail prices paid by its customers and/or reduce retail services provided to its customers as a means of offsetting some of the artificially inflated interchange fees,” Wal-Mart in court documents. “As a result, Wal-Mart’s retail sales were below what they would have been otherwise.” When asked whether Wal-Mart would file a suit against Mastercard, a spokesman for the retailer said the company would not discuss its litigation plans publicly. Wal-Mart contends that that the way Visa set swipe fees violated antitrust regulations and generated more than $350 billion for card issuers over the nearly 9-year period in question, in part at the expense of the retailer and customers.

221,V,Retailers push into crowded mobile payment market,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Big retailers are muscling in on the likes of Visa, MasterCard and Google in a fiercely competitive and growing mobile payment market that promises to cut transaction costs and increase customer loyalty. Stores such as British supermarket Tesco and France’s Auchan hope their “digital wallets” - apps which allow users to pay with their smartphones rather than cash or cards - will also give them more comprehensive data about customers’ shopping habits than ever before so they can target advertising. They are joining a crowded market - banks, card companies and tech firms like Google and Apple are all entering the mobile payment business, each hoping their app will become the industry standard. eBay’s PayPal, well established in e-commerce, is also experimenting with the technology. Retailers hope to attract customers to their own services by giving discounts and rewards to those using them, while also linking payments automatically to loyalty schemes and offering features like saved shopping lists. The global market for mobile payments is forecast to grow about threefold by 2017 to some $721 billion worth of transactions, with more than 450 million users, according to research firm Gartner. The growth could benefit retailers as the competition from a host of payment providers should help drive down the fees stores pay to have transactions processed - a service currently dominated by banks and card firms Visa and MasterCard. “We view merchants as overall beneficiaries of the trend toward mobile payments,” said Morgan Stanley, which estimated retailers in developed countries spent up to $150 billion in 2012 to accept card payments. “Expected returns should justify any incremental investments required in enabling mobile payments technology,” it said in a report in January. However, it is still unclear how the retail mobile payment market will develop, with card companies and banks seen retaining a leading role in processing payments even if physical cards become obsolete. Retailers’ apps might struggle to take off as customers are unlikely to be willing to use a variety of services for different stores, but the success of Starbucks Corp in combining mobile payments with promotions shows big players can succeed. Starbucks, the world’s biggest coffee chain, launched its mobile payment and rewards app in 2011. It already has 10 million users and the firm said this month it is looking for ways to expand the program beyond its own network. “The mobile payments platform has given us a higher degree of frequency and higher degree of loyalty and the question is how can we leverage that beyond our stores,” Starbucks Chairman and Chief Executive Howard Schultz told CNBC television. An alternative path is also being explored in the United States, where dozens of top retailers including Wal-Mart, Target and Best Buy have announced plans to set up a joint digital wallet service - the Merchant Customer Exchange, or MCX - though no launch date has been set. Meanwhile, an attempt to create a mobile payment app universally accepted by retailers has recently launched in Germany. Yapital, owned by e-commerce firm Otto, has gone live in thousands of stores and also allows users to pay online and make peer-to-peer transfers. Yapital Chairman Nils Winkler expects just a few players to survive of the 200 initiatives now clamoring for attention in Europe, with apps tied to retailers more likely to win out than those being developed by telecom and card firms. “The biggest success in this field will be retail-based. PayPal is a good example that has grown tremendously based on the retail success of eBay,” he said. Tesco, the world’s third-largest retailer which pioneered the tracking of customer behavior with its Clubcard loyalty card two decades ago, will launch its digital wallet this year, as it also starts offering current accounts. That is part of the British supermarket chain’s eventual plan to use smartphones - and its own-brand Hudl tablet computers - to allow customers to navigate stores with their devices and scan products to buy them as they shop. Sophie Albizua, co-founder of UK-based retail consultancy eNova Partnership, said her clients were ready to invest in overhauling outdated till systems to enable mobile payments. “People spent the last five to 10 years fine-tuning their websites. Now they have time to focus on something else.” French supermarket group Auchan, Europe’s fifth-biggest retailer, launched its “Flash and Pay” electronic wallet about a year ago. It combines payments with coupons, loyalty cards, receipts and a shopping list feature. “Our objective is to minimize costs. To have alternatives to existing solutions. All other solutions try to make costs for merchants,” Arnaud Crouzet, Auchan head of global payments, told the Merchant Payments Ecosystem conference in Berlin. “It is difficult to imagine our data on our customers going through a third party,” he added. Britain’s Centre for Economics and Business Research said there was a clear business case for digital wallets in terms of reduced costs and improved customer service and sales. UK retailers could have saved 463 million pounds ($770 million) in transaction costs in 2013 by shifting to mobile payments from cash, credit and charge cards, it estimates. Mobile payments could reduce queue length in stores by speeding users through tills and cut the cost of handling cash and card payments, it said. Handling cash - which accounts for over half retail transactions by volume in Britain - is costly for retailers as it needs to be counted and guarded, costs equivalent to about 2.5 percent of takings, compared with about 2 percent for processing cheques and 1 percent for debit and credit cards. However Carrefour, the world’s second biggest retailer after Wal-Mart, thinks shoppers need more time to be convinced. “For the moment, cards are still a good solution, especially contactless ones,” said Frederic Mazurier, a vice-president for finance and risk management at Carrefour Banque. “It is going to take quite a few years more.” ($1 = 0.6011 British pounds) ",4062014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-mobilepayment/retailers-push-into-crowded-mobile-payment-market-idUSBREA3503X20140406

224,V,"Visa says revenue growth to slow, Russia sanctions hurting volumes","(Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N), the world’s largest credit and debit card company, said U.S. sanctions on Russia were hurting its card transaction volumes and that revenue growth would slow further this quarter, sending its shares down 5 percent after the bell. Visa’s quarterly revenue growth slid to a single digit in percentage terms for the first time in more than four years, due to a strong U.S. dollar. The company and rival MasterCard Inc (MA.N) stopped providing services to two Russian banks after U.S. President Barack Obama imposed sanctions on Russia in March after a standoff over Ukraine. “We are caught between the politics of the United States and the politics of Russia,” Chief Financial Officer Byron Pollitt said on a post-earnings conference call on Thursday. “We’re clearly seeing a drop-off in cross-border volume and sanctions are expected to have some impact on volume.” Uncertainty over the companies’ operations in Russia lingers as Russian President Vladimir Putin has said the country would develop its own credit card system to reduce dependence on western companies. Visa said it would assess the situation in Russia and was hopeful it would still have a “meaningful opportunity” to continue to do business there. “We have 100 million cards there (in Russia) and it is not in anyone’s best interest, inclusive of the Russians, to make those cards not available to their own citizens,” Pollitt said. Visa said strength in the U.S. dollar was likely to slow its revenue growth further this quarter to “mid-single digits” in percentage terms. The company’s revenue growth slowed to 7 percent in the second quarter ended March 31 from 11 percent in the first quarter. Chief Executive Charlie Scharf said the impact of the strong dollar would be “slightly more pronounced” this quarter before rebounding in the following three months. Net income attributable to Visa rose 26 percent from a year earlier to $1.60 billion, or $2.52 per Class A share, in the second quarter. Visa earned $2.20 per share, excluding a tax benefit of $218 million in the quarter. Total operating revenue increased to $3.16 billion from $2.96 billion. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $2.18 per share on revenue of $3.19 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Visa said it expected full-year revenue to grow 10-11 percent. The company had earlier said its revenue was expected to grow in low double digits in percentage terms. The Foster City, California-based company maintained its earnings forecast, but said the guidance assumed “several pennies of earnings per share impact” from the situation in Russia. In March, Visa and MasterCard launched a cross-industry group to push for improved security in card transactions and press U.S. retailers and banks to meet a 2015 deadline to adopt the safer EMV technology. EMV cards, already used in Europe and Asia, store information on computer chips rather than on traditional magnetic strips, making them harder to counterfeit. Shares of Visa, which has a market value of about $133 billion, closed at $209.40 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. The stock has risen 13 percent since it was included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI in September.

Visa said it would assess the situation in Russia and was hopeful it would still have a “meaningful opportunity” to continue to do business there. “We have 100 million cards there (in Russia) and it is not in anyone’s best interest, inclusive of the Russians, to make those cards not available to their own citizens,” Pollitt said. Visa said strength in the U.S. dollar was likely to slow its revenue growth further this quarter to “mid-single digits” in percentage terms. The company’s revenue growth slowed to 7 percent in the second quarter ended March 31 from 11 percent in the first quarter. Chief Executive Charlie Scharf said the impact of the strong dollar would be “slightly more pronounced” this quarter before rebounding in the following three months. Net income attributable to Visa rose 26 percent from a year earlier to $1.60 billion, or $2.52 per Class A share, in the second quarter. Visa earned $2.20 per share, excluding a tax benefit of $218 million in the quarter. Total operating revenue increased to $3.16 billion from $2.96 billion. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $2.18 per share on revenue of $3.19 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Visa said it expected full-year revenue to grow 10-11 percent. The company had earlier said its revenue was expected to grow in low double digits in percentage terms. The Foster City, California-based company maintained its earnings forecast, but said the guidance assumed “several pennies of earnings per share impact” from the situation in Russia. In March, Visa and MasterCard launched a cross-industry group to push for improved security in card transactions and press U.S. retailers and banks to meet a 2015 deadline to adopt the safer EMV technology. EMV cards, already used in Europe and Asia, store information on computer chips rather than on traditional magnetic strips, making them harder to counterfeit. Shares of Visa, which has a market value of about $133 billion, closed at $209.40 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. The stock has risen 13 percent since it was included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in September.

Amazon’s stock declined a day after the company reported a jump in quarterly revenue, which was offset by sharp increases in spending. Ford Motor Co shares fell 3.3 percent to $15.78 after the No. 2 U.S. automaker reported first-quarter earnings that missed expectations. The company’s results were hurt by higher warranty costs in North America. The two weighed on the S&P; index of consumer discretionary stocks, which dropped 1.7 percent and ranked as the worst-performing sector of the day. “What that says is people are using any strength at all to raise some cash because they think the market is going to test lower,” said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York. Investors continued to pay attention to geopolitical strife over Ukraine, creating some nervousness heading into the weekend. U.S. President Barack Obama and four European allies agreed on Friday that Russia failed to live up to terms of the Ukraine peace accord, and would coordinate on a response to “impose costs” on Russia, the White House said. While the situation has taken a backseat to corporate earnings recently, investors remain on edge over the possible result of escalating tensions.

235,V,"NY state joins with Visa, MasterCard to curb payday lending","(Reuters) - New York state’s main banking regulator said on Wednesday it had teamed up with card payment companies Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc to curb illegal payday loans through debit card transactions. The Department of Financial Services said it would provide information to the card companies about payday lenders that might be using debit networks to recover illegal loans. Visa and MasterCard will then take action to block these transactions, the department said. ""By working with us to root out this illegal conduct, Visa and MasterCard have stepped up to the plate and shown how private companies can work alongside state government to protect vulnerable New Yorkers,"" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said in a statement. (link.reuters.com/tab98v) Benjamin Lawsky, the state’s superintendent of financial services, also sent cease-and-desist letters to 20 additional payday lenders, the department said.

238,V,Russia could relax rules for Visa and Mastercard -source,"ST PETERSBURG, Russia, May 22 (Reuters) - Russia is considering relaxing new rules imposed on foreign credit and debit card companies Visa and Mastercard after they stopped serving several Russian banks because of U.S. sanctions, a source close to the central bank said on Thursday. Russia’s parliament passed a law in April to oblige foreign card companies to pay a security deposit of 25 percent of their average daily turnover in Russia to the central bank once a quarter from July 1. Both Visa and Mastercard - the world’s two largest credit and debit card companies - had protested against the new rules, saying they would create significant complications for their business in Russia. “The problem of reaching an agreement (on the security deposit) will be handed over to the central bank or government,” the source told journalists on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum when asked if the rules would be relaxed. “Visa said it has taken the decision not to pay a cent,” the source added. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov later told journalists he would meet representatives from Visa and Mastercard on Friday. The new rules form part of a package of measures aimed at stimulating the creation of a Russian national payment system to reduce reliance on Western companies and provide a reserve to fall back on if tougher sanctions are imposed over Russia’s handling of the Ukraine crisis.

Russia’s parliament in April introduced legislation demanding the credit companies make a hefty security deposit to the central bank, a response to sanctions imposed on Moscow over its involvement in Ukraine. The Russian finance ministry, the central bank and local bankers have described the law as excessive and on Friday a meeting between government officials and the companies’ executives produced promises that both companies will stay. “We are willing to work in Russia and after this meeting we hope that a compromise solution will be found,” Andrew Torre, director of Visa in Russia, told reporters on the sidelines of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. Ilya Ryaby, general director of Mastercard in Russia, said his company would stay in Russia but that “the decision (on whether to relax the rules) depends first of all on the agreement of the president of the Russian Federation.” Amendments to the law, relaxing the requirements, will be prepared next week, Kremlin’s top economic aide Andrei Belousov told Russian news agencies. “We will introduce changes to the legislation, we’re looking at different options now,” Belousov was cited as saying. The rules, set to come into force on July 1, oblige foreign card companies to pay a security deposit of 25 percent of their average daily turnover in Russia to the central bank once a quarter. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told reporters that Visa and Mastercard had proposed creating their own Russia-based payment systems but that these plans would take around a year and a half to develop. In the meantime they would work with Russia’s existing payment systems, he said. “We are willing to cooperate in this direction,” Siluanov said. “I think we will find a solution that suits both Visa and Mastercard and the Russian Federation.” Visa and Mastercard stopped serving several Russian banks after the United States imposed sanctions over the annexation of Crimea in March, prompting criticism from President Vladimir Putin. Russia later launched a package of measures aimed at stimulating the creation of a Russian national payment system and reducing its reliance on Western companies. Visa and Mastercard launching their own Russia-based payment systems would significantly strengthen the government’s initiative to create the national payment system, said Mikhail Kuzmin, an analyst at Investcafe in Moscow. “Without Visa or Mastercard, it wouldn’t be possible for the government to do anything quickly,” he said, adding that the most likely solution would be for three separate Russian systems owned by Visa, Mastercard and the central bank to co-exist. Although in terms of revenues, Russia remains a minor market for both companies, the country’s credit card system is developing and its 140 million population could offer greater potential for growth than developed countries. Business in Russia accounts for just over 2 percent of Mastercard’s total net revenue, and the company said the sanctions had little impact on its first-quarter results. Visa, which has some 100 million cards in Russia, said in April U.S. sanctions were hurting its transaction volumes. “It’s not in anyone’s interest for either Visa or Mastercard to leave,” Kuzmin said. “For the companies, Russia is a fast-growing market, and for the authorities over 90 percent of Russian cards now use Visa and Mastercard systems.” ",5232014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-forum-visa-mastercard/visa-mastercard-vow-to-stay-as-russia-softens-tone-on-rules-idUSBREA4M08I20140523

242,V,Visa pushes for more access to barely-tapped Ethiopia,"ADDIS ABABA, May 26 (Reuters) - Visa Inc., which is piloting Ethiopia’s first international debit card, is seeking to persuade the government to ease tight restrictions on banks in an effort to boost the use of electronic payments. Ethiopia has one of Africa’s fastest-growing economies but few people in the Horn of Africa nation of 90 million have bank accounts and the range of services is limited. The government bars foreign banks, saying it needs to protect domestic lenders, and local debit cards have until now not worked abroad. Jabu Basopo, Visa’s manager for southern and east Africa, said the focus was on persuading leaders of the $43 billion economy that is dominated by state enterprise about the benefits of electronic payments. “They are willing to try some things,” said Basopo. “They have agreed to a pilot for international cards. It is a very controlled environment.” Users of Visa’s international card, which is being trialled by government officials, will be restricted to spending an amount that has been pre-loaded on the card. Visa said the government was pleased with the trial so far. Basopo said local banks lacked muscle to push the central bank to drive change in an industry where the largest commercial lender is run by the state and holds two-thirds of all deposits. He pointed to Rwanda as an example of where business-friendly reforms to liberalise banking regulations in the past four years had led to a swift deepening of the market. “Rwanda was in a similar situation. (Now) every bank is listed to Visa. All the ATMs in the country are linked to Visa ... and we’ve seen a lot of growth in terms of retailers actually accepting Visa cards now,” Basopo said. Retail transactions in Ethiopia are primarily made in cash. Retailers say a scarcity of debit cards hinders growth in the retail sector, which is also off-limits to foreign chains. “If you look at the main efficiencies brought by electronic payments ... more money stays in the banks and the banks are able to lend that money back to retailers to do more business,” Basopo said. Visa, the world’s largest credit and debit card company which counts 10 Ethiopian banks as members, first entered the country in 2004. The International Monetary Fund has warned that Ethiopia’s huge public spending on roads, railways and power is suffocating private lending. It says Ethiopia should row back on public spending to allow the private sector greater access to credit.

243,V,Monitise names former Visa executive as co-CEO,"(Reuters) - Monitise Plc has hired a former Visa Inc executive to co-run the company as it pursues a sevenfold increase in the number of customers using its mobile banking and payment systems. Shares of Monitise rose as much as 7.1 percent on Wednesday after the company announced the appointment of Elizabeth Buse as co-chief executive. Buse, 53, will work alongside Monitise’s founder and current chief executive, Alastair Lukies. Her appointment is effective immediately. “Her joining gives a lot of credibility to Monitise as a business and to their claim of gaining market share,” said Ali Khwaja, analyst at Berenberg Bank. Founded in 2003, Monitise says it processes mobile payments, purchases and transfers to the value of $71 billion annually. Its customers include Telefonica SA, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, MasterCard Inc and Visa. The company, which has a market capitalisation of 1.17 billion pounds ($1.96 billion), this year unveiled plans to increase the number of its registered users to 200 million by 2018 from 28 million. “Buse’s appointment ... adds operational expertise just as the company is ramping up its effort to grow users,” Mark Palmer, analyst at BTIG, wrote in a note. Buse spent 16 years at Visa and was a leading candidate for the top job at the world’s largest credit and debit card company before the October 2012 appointment of JPMorgan veteran Charlie Scharf, the Wall Street Journal reported at the time. She held several senior positions at Visa before stepping down in March as executive vice-president of solutions. She served on Monitise’s board from July 2010 until October 2012. Buse, a U.S. national, will take over the running of Monitise’s day-to-day operations and will oversee technology, sales and marketing. Lukies will focus on corporate development and key relationships with partners and major shareholders. “The co-CEO approach has been more successful when there is a clear separation of areas of responsibility,” said Palmer. Monitise derives about 40 percent of its revenue from the Americas, 40 percent from Britain and 20 percent from the rest of the world. “We are actually planning to expand in all our geographies,” Buse, who will divide her time between Monitise’s London and California offices, said in an interview. “We already have business in Asia-Pacific - that’s a big opportunity. South America is a big opportunity for us,” she said. “The U.S is a very large revenue market for us, and we expect that to continue to grow.” Buse holds a Master’s Degree in Business Administration from the Haas School at the University of California Berkeley.

247,V,UPDATE 5-Soccer sponsors raise pressure on FIFA over Qatar claims,"* Sponsors signal unease on Qatar 2022 bribe allegations * Allegations cloud build-up to Brazil tournament this week * Sponsors, broadcasters would benefit from move to another venue   (Adds Coca-Cola reaction) By Keith Weir and Ossian Shine LONDON/RIO DE JANEIRO June 8 (Reuters) - Sponsors Adidas , Sony, Visa and Coca-Cola on Sunday called on soccer’s rulers to deal thoroughly with allegations of bribery to secure the 2022 World Cup for Qatar, an issue overshadowing this week’s kickoff in Brazil. With its four yearly showpiece event only four days away, soccer’s governing body FIFA is on the defensive, conducting an internal investigation into the decisions to hold the 2018 World Cup in Russia and the 2022 Cup in Qatar. Both countries have denied any wrongdoing. Qatar’s bid has attracted controversy from the outset because of the extreme summer heat during the months when the Cup is played and the tiny country’s lack of domestic soccer tradition. If it goes ahead, the tournament is expected to be switched to a date later in the year, creating scheduling headaches for broadcasters and European club soccer clubs. The signs of unease from some of FIFA’s paymasters will raise pressure on the body, led by its 78-year-old Swiss president Sepp Blatter, to get to the bottom of the allegations and tackle underlying concerns about how it is run. “The negative tenor of the public debate around FIFA at the moment is neither good for football nor for FIFA and its partners,” said German sportswear company Adidas, which has signed up as FIFA sponsor until 2030, extending a partnership dating back to 1970. Coca-Cola concurred. “Anything that detracts from the mission and ideals of the FIFA World Cup is a concern to us,” a company statement read. “But we are confident that FIFA is taking these allegations very seriously and is investigating them thoroughly through the Investigatory Chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee. “The FIFA World Cup is a platform that unites people all over the world, inspiring and celebrating the world’s most popular sport while creating memorable experiences for athletes and fans. We believe that through our partnership and continued involvement with FIFA we can help foster optimism and unity, while making a positive difference in the communities we serve.” Britain’s Sunday Times newspaper has over the last two weekends printed what it says are leaked documents showing bribes were paid to secure the event for Qatar, which Qatar denies. Former U.S. prosecutor Michael Garcia, leading FIFA’s internal investigation, is due to report in July, around a week after this year’s World Cup final. FIFA issued a statement from the body’s marketing director Thierry Weil as it sought to take heat out of the situation. “We are in constant contact with our Commercial Affiliates including adidas, Sony and Visa and they have 100 percent confidence in the investigation currently being conducted by FIFA’s independent Ethics Committee,” Weil said. “Our sponsors have not requested anything that is not covered by the on-going investigation by the Ethics Committee.” Payment card company Visa, which has a contract as a FIFA sponsor until 2022, said it was monitoring the progress of the Garcia investigation. “We expect FIFA will take the appropriate actions to respond to the report and its recommendations,” it said in a statement. Japanese consumer goods company Sony took a similar line, saying said it expected the allegations to be “investigated appropriately”. It is unusual for sponsors to say anything publicly on such a sensitive issue and the comments reflect concern over the knock-on effects on their image. “This underlines that companies need to make sure that any high profile association enhances their reputation rather than damages it,” said Andy Sutherden, Global Head of Sports Marketing & Sponsorship at communications firm H+K Strategies. FIFA, which Blatter has led since 1998, earned almost $1.4 billion last year, including more than $600 million from the sale of broadcasting rights and more than $400 million from sponsors and other marketing partners. Sony, Adidas, Visa and Coca-Cola are among six main FIFA sponsors who collectively paid around $180 million last year. Sony’s sponsorship agreement, which also included the 2010 World Cup,  expires this year, giving it particular leverage as it negotiates a new deal. Airline Emirates, whose sponsorship deal is also up for renewal at the end of the year, declined to comment, as did South Korean carmaker Hyundai/Kia. The Sunday Times printed new accusations on Sunday, just four days before the 2014 tournament kicks off in Brazil, alleging that then-Asian football chief Mohamed Bin Hammam, a Qatari, had brokered meetings between Qatari officials and governments to discuss bilateral trade deals. Qatar denies Bin Hammam was connected to its bid for the Cup. Bin Hammam has not commented. FIFA has already banned Bin Hammam for life from soccer over accusations he paid bribes to win votes for a bid to become FIFA president. That ban was overturned but another was imposed for conflicts of interest. FIFA is now facing calls to strip Qatar of the World Cup should Garcia’s investigation prove that it bought the votes needed to host the tournament. The United States, Australia, Japan and South Korea were the rivals who lost out to Qatar in the 2010 vote and are all safer choices as former hosts of major sporting events and developed markets for consumer brands. U.S. broadcaster Fox, which paid an estimated $425 million for rights to the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, was already unhappy with plans to switch the dates of the Qatar tournament to later in the calendar year when it would clash with the NFL American football programme. Both fans and sponsors would be likely to cheer a switch to a different venue, although Qatar would be certain to mount a legal challenge to keep the Cup. “None of the sponsors would want it to be held in Qatar,” said David Peters, managing director of marketing company Dentsu Aegis Network Sport & Entertainment. “FIFA haven’t given a great deal of consideration to sponsors. The sport is so big, they are less beholden than other sports,” he added.

Coca-Cola  was not immediately available for comment. The Sunday Times printed new accusations on Sunday, just four days before the 2014 tournament kicks off in Brazil, alleging that then-Asian football chief Mohamed Bin Hammam, a Qatari, had brokered meetings between Qatari officials and governments to discuss bilateral trade deals. Qatar denies Bin Hammam was connected to its bid for the Cup. Bin Hammam has not commented. FIFA has already banned Bin Hammam for life from soccer over accusations he paid bribes to win votes for a bid to become FIFA president. That ban was overturned but another was imposed for conflicts of interest. FIFA is now facing calls to strip Qatar of the World Cup should Garcia’s investigation prove that it bought the votes needed to host the tournament. The United States, Australia, Japan and South Korea were the rivals who lost out to Qatar in the 2010 vote and are all safer choices as former hosts of major sporting events and developed markets for consumer brands. U.S. broadcaster Fox, which paid an estimated $425 million for rights to the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, was already unhappy with plans to switch the dates of the Qatar tournament to later in the calendar year when it would clash with the NFL American football programme. Both fans and sponsors would be likely to cheer a switch to a different venue, although Qatar would be certain to mount a legal challenge to keep the Cup. “None of the sponsors would want it to be held in Qatar,” said David Peters, managing director of marketing company Dentsu Aegis Network Sport & Entertainment. “FIFA haven’t given a great deal of consideration to sponsors. The sport is so big, they are less beholden than other sports,” he added.

249,V,UPDATE 6-Soccer sponsors raise pressure on FIFA over Qatar claims,"* Sponsors signal unease on Qatar 2022 bribe allegations * Allegations cloud build-up to Brazil tournament this week * Sponsors, broadcasters would benefit from move to another venue   (Adds Kia comment) By Keith Weir and Ossian Shine LONDON/RIO DE JANEIRO June 8 (Reuters) - Sponsors Adidas , Sony, Visa and Coca-Cola on Sunday called on soccer’s rulers to deal thoroughly with allegations of bribery to secure the 2022 World Cup for Qatar, an issue overshadowing this week’s kickoff in Brazil. With its four yearly showpiece event only four days away, soccer’s governing body FIFA is on the defensive, conducting an internal investigation into the decisions to hold the 2018 World Cup in Russia and the 2022 Cup in Qatar. Both countries have denied any wrongdoing. Qatar’s bid has attracted controversy from the outset because of the extreme summer heat during the months when the Cup is played and the tiny country’s lack of domestic soccer tradition. If it goes ahead, the tournament is expected to be switched to a date later in the year, creating scheduling headaches for broadcasters and European club soccer clubs. The signs of unease from some of FIFA’s paymasters will raise pressure on the body, led by its 78-year-old Swiss president Sepp Blatter, to get to the bottom of the allegations and tackle underlying concerns about how it is run. “The negative tenor of the public debate around FIFA at the moment is neither good for football nor for FIFA and its partners,” said German sportswear company Adidas, which has signed up as FIFA sponsor until 2030, extending a partnership dating back to 1970. Coca-Cola concurred. “Anything that detracts from the mission and ideals of the FIFA World Cup is a concern to us,” a company statement read. “But we are confident that FIFA is taking these allegations very seriously and is investigating them thoroughly through the Investigatory Chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee. “The FIFA World Cup is a platform that unites people all over the world, inspiring and celebrating the world’s most popular sport while creating memorable experiences for athletes and fans. We believe that through our partnership and continued involvement with FIFA we can help foster optimism and unity, while making a positive difference in the communities we serve.” Britain’s Sunday Times newspaper has over the last two weekends printed what it says are leaked documents showing bribes were paid to secure the event for Qatar, which Qatar denies. Former U.S. prosecutor Michael Garcia, leading FIFA’s internal investigation, is due to report in July, around a week after this year’s World Cup final. FIFA issued a statement from the body’s marketing director Thierry Weil as it sought to take heat out of the situation. “We are in constant contact with our Commercial Affiliates including Adidas, Sony and Visa and they have 100 percent confidence in the investigation currently being conducted by FIFA’s independent Ethics Committee,” Weil said. “Our sponsors have not requested anything that is not covered by the on-going investigation by the Ethics Committee.” Payment card company Visa, which has a contract as a FIFA sponsor until 2022, said it was monitoring the progress of the Garcia investigation. “We expect FIFA will take the appropriate actions to respond to the report and its recommendations,” it said in a statement. Japanese consumer goods company Sony took a similar line, saying said it expected the allegations to be “investigated appropriately”. It is unusual for sponsors to say anything publicly on such a sensitive issue and the comments reflect concern over the knock-on effects on their image. “This underlines that companies need to make sure that any high profile association enhances their reputation rather than damages it,” said Andy Sutherden, Global Head of Sports Marketing & Sponsorship at communications firm H+K Strategies. FIFA, which Blatter has led since 1998, earned almost $1.4 billion last year, including more than $600 million from the sale of broadcasting rights and more than $400 million from sponsors and other marketing partners. Sony, Adidas, Visa and Coca-Cola are among six main FIFA sponsors who collectively paid around $180 million last year. Sony’s sponsorship agreement, which also included the 2010 World Cup,  expires this year, giving it particular leverage as it negotiates a new deal. Airline Emirates, whose sponsorship deal is also up for renewal at the end of the year, declined to comment. South Korean carmaker Kia Motors Corp, which shares sponsorship of the tournament with its affiliate Hyundai Motor Co, said in a statement: “We are confident that FIFA is taking these allegations seriously and that the Investigatory Chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee will conduct a thorough investigation.” The Sunday Times printed new accusations on Sunday, just four days before the 2014 tournament kicks off in Brazil, alleging that then-Asian football chief Mohamed Bin Hammam, a Qatari, had brokered meetings between Qatari officials and governments to discuss bilateral trade deals.

Visa’s shares rose 2 percent to a two-month high of $215.34 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while MasterCard’s stock rose 3.1 percent to $75.74. “The companies have been offered to transfer processing of internal Russian transactions to any nationally important payment system by Oct. 31,” Central Bank of Russia Chairwoman Elvira Nabiullina was quoted as saying by Russian news agency ITAR-TASS. “If they succeed in doing it by Oct. 31, then the pledges will be minimized to zero.” New rules following Western sanctions over Ukraine required foreign card companies to deposit with the central bank an amount equal to two days of their average processing volume in Russia. Analysts had estimated that Visa and MasterCard could end up paying up to $2.9 billion to operate in the country. Visa and MasterCard had considered quitting Russia after President Vladimir Putin signed the rules into law in early May, but the companies said they would stay after officials showed willingness to relax the requirements. A law that came into effect on Tuesday prohibits foreign companies from blocking transactions of Russian banks. The law is part of a new legislation aimed at setting up a domestic payment system to reduce the country’s dependency on foreign companies.

Retailers such as Target Corp and Amazon.com Inc  have accused Visa and MasterCard of fixing the fees charged to merchants each time their customers used credit or debit cards. They also alleged the two companies prevented merchants from steering customers to cheaper forms of payment. U.S. District Judge John Gleeson of Brooklyn said on Friday the lawsuits could proceed, according to Jeffrey Shinder, an attorney for some of the retailers. Shinder declined further comment. In December, Gleeson approved an estimated $5.7 billion settlement between the two credit card companies and a nationwide class of merchants over similar allegations. But thousands of retailers, including some of the biggest in the United States such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc, opted out of the settlement, complaining it was not adequate. Those companies argued the settlement offered meaningless reforms that would not help them control the costs of accepting credit cards. Many of those retailers who objected to the settlement filed their own lawsuits. A spokesman for MasterCard said in a statement that Gleeson’s ruling on Friday was at earliest stage of the case. “We look forward to putting this matter behind us and continuing to work productively with the merchant community,” he said. A Visa spokesman had no immediate comment.

254,V,Visa cuts revenue forecast as cross-border transactions slow,"(Reuters) - Visa Inc, the world’s largest credit and debit card company, cut its revenue forecast for the year, as growth in cross-border transactions slowed amid a strengthening of the U.S. dollar. The company’s shares were down 2.9 percent at $214.75 in extended trading.    Visa, which gets about 60 percent of its total transaction volume from outside the United States, cut its full-year revenue growth forecast to 9-10 percent from 10-11 percent. International transaction revenue rose less than 1 percent to $854 million in the latest quarter.     Wedbush Securities Inc analyst Gil Luria said Visa’s international transaction revenues was growing at the lowest rate since the financial crisis.     “Service revenue and processing revenue growth was adequate. It’s more the international revenue, the cross border transaction, that took a step down this quarter,” Luria said. The U.S. dollar held near eight–month highs against the euro on Wednesday as worries over tougher sanctions on Russia and their potential impact on fragile euro zone growth weighed on the single currency.     Chief Financial Officer Byron Pollitt said on a conference call that he anticipates some loss from processing revenue in Russia, where new laws have made it costlier for foreign card companies to operate in the country.     Visa and rival MasterCard Inc had considered quitting the Russian market after President Vladimir Putin signed a new law that would have forced the two companies to deposit a collateral of $2.9 billion to continue operating in the country. However, officials have shown willingness to relax the requirements and said if the two companies can find local processing partners by the end of October, they may be able to avoid paying the collateral. Russia accounts for 2 percent of Visa’s total revenue, most of it coming from cross border transactions, and the recent actions by Russia target Visa’s domestic business. Visa’s net income rose to $1.36 billion, or $2.17 per Class A share, in the third quarter ended June 30 from $1.23 billion, or $1.88 per Class A share, a year earlier.     Total operating revenue rose 5.1 percent to $3.16 billion. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $2.10 per share on revenue of $3.15 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Visa’s payment volumes on a constant dollar basis rose 11.5 percent to $1.19 trillion in the quarter.

While the S&P; 500 found support at its 14-day moving average, suggesting a recent positive trend in equities remains intact, the day’s decline was enough to erase the benchmark index’s gain for the week. Earnings have largely been better than expected this season in terms of both profit and revenue. However, there have been high-profile disappointments, including Boeing Co and Caterpillar Inc earlier this week. Amazon.com Inc tumbled 9.6 percent to $324.01 as the biggest drag on the S&P; 500 after reporting an unexpectedly big second-quarter loss due to greater expenses on investments. About 17.8 million shares changed hands, nearly five times its 50-day average of 3.6 million. The online retailer weighed down the consumer discretionary sector, which lost 1.2 percent. Visa Inc was the Dow’s largest decliner, down 3.6 percent to $214.77 after the world’s largest credit and debit card company cut its revenue forecast for the year.  As the costliest stock in the price-weighted index, Visa accounted for about half the Dow’s drop. “The earnings season overall has been in line (with analysts’ estimates), but when companies with rich valuations disappoint, you’re going to get crucified,” said Lawrence Glazer, managing partner at Mayflower Advisors in Boston. “Amazon and Visa are significant components of the overall market and bellwethers of their respective industries. That gives you pause.” Only two of the 10 primary S&P; 500 industry sectors were positive on the day. About 64 percent of stocks traded on both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq ended the day lower. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 123.23 points, or 0.72 percent, to 16,960.57, the S&P; 500 lost 9.64 points, or 0.48 percent, to 1,978.34 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 22.54 points, or 0.5 percent, to 4,449.56. For the week, the Dow is down 0.8 percent, the S&P; is flat and the Nasdaq is up 0.4 percent in its second straight weekly rise. About 4.95 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, below the month-to-date average of 5.56 billion. Starbucks fell 2.1 percent to $78.74 even as quarterly sales at established stores in its Americas region grew a stronger-than-expected 6 percent. Pandora Media dropped 10 percent to $25.75 after it forecast adjusted profit below analysts’ estimates for the current quarter. On the upside, Baidu was up 11 percent to $226.50. China’s biggest Internet search company blew past Wall Street’s targets with a 34.1 percent jump in quarterly net profit, helped by a surge in mobile revenue. El Pollo Loco Holdings Inc shares surged 60 percent to $24.03 in their trading debut after the company’s initial public offering was priced at the high end of an expected range. The stock was the biggest percentage gainer among Nasdaq stocks. The market did not react to data showing orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods rose more than expected in June, supporting hopes for a strong economic rebound in the second quarter. Goldman Sachs downgraded its global allocation to equities to neutral on a short-term basis on Friday, even though the brokerage remained overweight stocks for the longer term, it said in a research note. The firm said it was worried that a rise in rates would drive stocks lower over the next three months, adding: “We also expect the general pace of returns to slow compared to what we have seen in the last couple of years.” Goldman said the global acceleration in economic growth is “largely behind us and geopolitical risks are elevated.” Still, it said equities were the most attractive class on a 12-month horizon “by a wide margin.” Equity markets worldwide have rallied steadily through the year. The MSCI All-World Index hit a record in early July, and has gained more than 5 percent in 2014. Goldman noted that the gap between dividend yields and government bond yields remained high, which suggests more outperformance by the equity market. Dividing the world up by regions, Goldman was overweight in Europe and Japan and underweight in the United States. When looking at specific sectors, the firm was high on growth industries - it has overweight ratings for technology stocks in the United States, Europe, Japan and Asia.

Wall Street ended flat as the latest deal news offset losses following soft data on the housing market and services sector. The market may also be hitting resistance with the Dow Jones industrial average sitting just below 17,000 and the S&P; 500 near 2,000. “Technically, we are battling round numbers that I think give investors reason to pause,” said Todd Salamone, senior vice president of Research, Schaeffer’s Investment Research in Cincinnati. The U.S. dollar traded mostly flat against a basket of major currencies, halting last week’s advance but still hovering near six-month highs. Investors and traders were hesitant to make bold moves on concerns over new European sanctions against Moscow and ahead of Wednesday’s release of U.S. second-quarter gross domestic product. The calendar also includes a Federal Reserve policy announcement on Wednesday and U.S. nonfarm payrolls data Friday. Economists forecast U.S. GDP grew 3 percent in the second quarter after a sharp contraction of 2.9 percent in the first quarter, and expect U.S. employers to have added 233,000 jobs in July, according to Reuters polls.

265,V,CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-AmEx profit rises 9 pct as card holders spend more,"(Corrects paragraph 1 to removed words ... better than expected...) July 29 (Reuters) - American Express Co reported a 9 percent rise in quarterly profit that matched analysts’ estimates as more customers used its credit cards in a recovering U.S. economy. Card member spending rose 9 percent globally, after adjusting for foreign currency, compared to 7 percent growth in the preceding quarter and 8 percent growth in the second quarter last year. “The strong underlying performance this quarter reflected a continuation of some familiar themes: higher card member spending, credit metrics at or near their historic lows, a modest increase in loan balances,” Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Chenault said in a statement. U.S. consumer spending picked up in the second quarter after an usually harsh winter dampened sales in the first quarter. American Express, which mostly issues its own cards unlike Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc that work through banks, benefits from its largely affluent customers’ consistent spending and low rates of default. AmEx’s net income rose to $1.53 billion, or $1.43 per share, for the second quarter ended June 30, from $1.41 billion, or $1.27 per share, a year earlier. Total revenue, net of interest expense, rose 5 percent to $8.66 billion. Analysts, on average, expected earnings of $1.38 per share on revenue of $8.66 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income for the second quarter also included a gain of $626 million from the spinoff into a joint venture of AmEx’s business travel operations. T Total expenses rose 2 percent to $5.86 billion, due partly to a rise in marketing costs. AmEx shares, which closed at $91.71 on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, were trading almost flat after the bell. They have gained 3 percent since the beginning of the year.

271,V,UPDATE 1-Indian card payment network RuPay sees boost from government banking scheme,"(Adds Visa comment in 13th and 14th paragraphs) By Devidutta Tripathy MUMBAI, Sept 11 (Reuters) - A government drive to expand banking services in India is giving a boost to home-grown card payment network RuPay, which expects to quadruple the number of users by March and make debit cards more acceptable in a nation where cash is still king. Started in 2012 by a company owned by 10 local and foreign banks, RuPay competes with global payment firms Visa Inc  and MasterCard Inc for the few customers in Asia’s third largest economy able to afford a debit or credit card. As of July, banks issued just under 435 million payment cards in India, a nation of 1.3 billion people. Most were debit cards. RuPay’s share of daily card transactions, however, remains small compared with the global firms, which are more established, offer both debit and credit cards and are accepted by more retailers. RuPay currently offers only debit cards. RuPay users account for just 1.5 percent of daily card transactions of almost one million at retailers, said A.P. Hota, chief executive of the National Payments Corp of India (NPCI), which runs RuPay. Hota told Reuters the payments network was set to grow rapidly from the government’s so-called financial inclusion scheme, which aims to ensure the majority of households has a bank account within months. Under the scheme launched late in August, Indians who open a bank account for the first time automatically get a RuPay card. Hota said the number of RuPay users has now almost doubled from 23 million at the end of July. By March next year, he expects that number to rise to 160 million, with more than 60 percent of the increase coming from the government scheme. “Jan Dhan itself would provide a big opportunity for the domestic card brand to be a formidable force,” said Hota, referring to the financial inclusion scheme, Jan Dhan Yojana, which means People’s Wealth Scheme. “(RuPay Card transactions are) just a drop in the ocean at the moment. But drop by drop we are increasing our size.” NPCI is also trying to lure more customers by charging banks lower fees than Visa and MasterCard, Hota added. Visa, the world’s largest credit and debit card company, declined to give its India market share, but said the country was amongst the world’s fastest-growing payments markets. “We believe Visa is well-positioned competitively,” Uttam Nayak, group country manager of India and South Asia, at Visa, said in emailed comments, adding his company welcomed competition. MasterCard did not reply to Reuters’ requests seeking comment. NPCI’s shareholders include India’s biggest bank, the State Bank of India, and foreign lenders Citibank and HSBC. The central bank has a nominee on its board. The organisation plans to launch RuPay cards that will be accepted overseas through a partnership with Discover Financial Services, Hota said, and is also in talks with Japanese card network JCB about a partnership. RuPay had aimed to issue credit cards by March 2015, but those plans have now been delayed by the government scheme, Hota said. “Rural acceptance of the Jan Dhan cards will be our priority,” he added.

273,V,Monitise shares tumble as Visa explores options for stake,"(Reuters) - Monitise Plc lost more than a third of its market value after Visa Inc, its biggest customer, revealed plans to divest its stake in the company and pursue development of its own mobile payment systems. Visa, the world’s largest credit and debit card company, said it was “considering its options” regarding its 5.5 percent stake in Monitise, which processes mobile payments, purchases and transfers worth $88 billion annually. “Visa intends to continue increasing its investment in its own in-house capabilities and, as a result, reducing its use of external resources,” Visa said on Thursday.  Monitise, co-managed by a former Visa executive, is contracted to provide mobile banking services to Visa until 2016. About 290 million pounds (about $475 million) of Monitise’s market capitalization was wiped off on Thursday, making it the biggest percentage loser on the London Stock Exchange. With tech giants Google Inc and Apple Inc launching free mobile payment systems, the role of traditional mobile payment companies are under question. “If I were Visa, I would ask: What is Monitise bringing to the table in a world of Apple and Google? The answer is a blank sheet of paper,” said Thomas Noyes, a financial technology investor and former head of channels at Citigroup’s Global Consumer Group. Visa has hired J.P. Morgan Securities for considering options for the Monitise investment. Berenberg analyst Ali Khwaja told Reuters that the discontinuation of the contract would mean an about 10 percent reduction in Monitise’s revenue. “This is a big question mark on the management’s credibility (to deliver numbers). It also raises questions about Visa Europe’s stake and raises doubts about whether Visa Europe will continue to work with Monitise,” Khwaja said. He added that the company’s contract with Visa Europe, which separately holds a stake of 6 percent in Monitise, was also worth about 10 million pounds. Visa Inc and Monitise, which had hired former Visa executive Elizabeth Buse as co-CEO in June to focus on day-to-day operations, declined further comment. Monitise’s largest investor Omega Advisors also declined comment. The U.S.-based hedge fund manager owns an 11.27 percent stake in the company, according to Thomson Reuters data. Visa Inc first invested in Monitise in 2009, when the company’s revenue was about 3 million pounds and the mobile payments market was still young. It has reduced its original 14.4 percent stake over time. Monitise, founded in 2003, has had a tumultuous 2014, with its stock falling about 37 percent this year through Wednesday’s close. The stock has been sliding since the company issued two revenue warnings as it moved to a subscription-based model. The company’s shares closed down about 35 percent at 29.19 pence.

As voting on Scottish independence began at 0600 GMT on Thursday, various surveys showed support for union at 52 percent and for independence at 48 percent. Another showed unionist support at 51 percent and separatist at 49 percent. Yet another put the gap at 53 percent and 47 percent. “The polling stations in Scotland may be open for a good few hours yet, but the City appears to have already concluded that this is a win for the ‘No’ campaign,” said Tony Cross, a market analyst at Trustnet Direct. “I think a ‘No’ will send stocks much higher tomorrow.” A Thomson Reuters basket of 12 stocks listed on Britain's FTSE 350 index, headquartered in Scotland, has slowly risen over the last two weeks. (link.reuters.com/wej72w) The stocks have recovered from lows at the start of the month, after plunging when a poll showed a surprising lead for the pro-independence side. Cavendish Asset Management fund manager Paul Mumford said he had used the earlier pullback on Scottish-exposed stocks to buy those shares cheap. “I personally think that there will probably be a ‘No’ vote. If there’s a ‘No’ vote, it removes the uncertainty hanging over those stocks,” said Mumford. Mumford added to holdings in Scotland-headquartered distribution group John Menzies and North Sea oil-focused groups Hurricane Energy and Ithaca Energy  .

Nygren, whose 10.3 percent gain for the year puts his fund in the top 1 percent of 1,586 large cap funds tracked by Morningstar, sees phone-based payments as accelerating the demise of cash. That should be especially helpful to MasterCard, the second-largest payments company globally, in emerging market countries where smartphones are more plentiful than bank accounts, he said. “If I pay with a smartphone instead of a credit card, that doesn’t mean that MasterCard is going to be missing out on its fraction of a percentage of the sale.” While he owns shares of Visa Inc in another fund he managers, Nygren has been buying MasterCard for the Oakmark Select fund, because it has more to gain from growth overseas and should perform better over the next three to five years, he said. Visa, by comparison, is more U.S.-focused, he said. Visa gets more than 50 percent of its revenue domestically, compared with 40 percent for MasterCard, according to Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. The drop in MasterCard shares, which trails the benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500 by about 17 percentage points year to date, makes the company a bargain even though it trades at 26.5  times trailing earnings, Nygren said. He expects the company to increase earnings by approximately 20 percent a year for the next several years as it continues to grow overseas, compared with single digit growth for the S&P; 500. Visa, by comparison, is down 5 percent for the year and trades at a cheaper 23 times trailing earnings. Nygren is not put off by the fact that MasterCard is more expensive by those measures, even as it underperforms its competitors. “Buying excellent companies at average prices is just as much value investing as buying average companies at exceptional prices,” Nygren said. Analysts are largely bullish on the company, with an average target price among analysts tracked by Reuters of $89.02, a figure 22 percent higher than its closing price of $73.42 on Thursday. Twenty-eight out of 35 analysts tracked by Reuters have an overweight or buy rating, with just one, Christopher Donat at Sandler O’Neill Partners, having a sell rating. Concerns that the company’s growth will slow after years of strong performance is one of the main reasons behind its falling stock price this year, said Wedbush’s Luria, who has a “hold” rating on the shares and a target price of $80. He recently reduced his 2014 earnings per share estimate for the company to $3.04 from $3.14. “The upside is less than it used to be,” he said, adding that Chase bank’s decision early this year to shift customers from MasterCard-branded debit and credit cards to Visa cards will continue to cut into growth. Mastercard did not comment for this story. Nygren is not put off by MasterCard’s continued declines since he began buying. Shares are down 2.2 percent over the last week alone. “MasterCard has not helped our performance this year, but there is nothing fundamentally going on at the company that we are concerned about,” he said.

282,V,UPDATE 1-AmEx quarterly profit rises as U.S. card holders spend more,"(Adds details, shares) Oct 15 (Reuters) - American Express Co, the world’s largest credit card issuer, reported an 8.1 percent rise in quarterly profit due to higher spending by U.S. customers using its credit cards and a rise in its net interest income. Spending by U.S. holders of AmEx cards rose 9 percent in the third quarter, boosting profit in the business by 14 percent. The business accounted for nearly three-quarters of the company’s profit. U.S. consumer spending rose 0.5 percent in August after being unchanged in July, the Commerce Department said last month. AmEx, which issues its own cards unlike Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc that work through banks, benefits from its largely affluent customer base and low rates of default. However, single-digit growth in spending by its card users for about two years has pushed the company to launch products such as a fee-free card that targets a wider range of customers. The company’s net income rose to $1.48 billion, or $1.40 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from $1.37 billion, or $1.25 per share, a year earlier. Net interest income rose 8.7 percent to $1.4 billion. However, total revenue, net of interest expense, remained nearly unchanged at $8.33 billion. Chief Executive Kenneth Chenault said AmEx’s revenue was growing at a pace below the company’s long-term target. “While the economy is stronger, it is not growing as fast or as steadily as most people would like,” he said in a statement. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.36 per share and revenue of $8.35 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. AmEx’s shares closed at $80.93 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

283,V,Apple CEO fires back as retailers block Pay,"LAGUNA BEACH, Calif., Oct 27 (Reuters) - Apple Inc  CEO Tim Cook fired back at CVS and Rite Aid on Monday after the drugstore chains blocked the iPhone maker’s mobile payments service, saying there were plenty of other retailers around the world to sign up. Apple Pay launched about a week ago and saw more than a million credit cards registered over the first 72 hours. It already totes up more transactions than all other “contactless” payment methods combined, Cook said, citing Visa and Mastercard data. Such services, through which a user pays by holding a smartphone close to a specially designed terminal, have failed to catch on in the United States despite the backing of Google Inc and other influential players. News emerged over the weekend that the two retailers had opted out of Apple Pay in favor of a rival system that roughly 50 chains, including Wal-Mart and Best Buy, are developing for in-house use. “We’ve got a lot more merchants to sign up, we’ve got a lot of banks to sign up and we’ve got the rest of the world,” Cook told the Wall Street Journal Digital Live conference, in the company’s most extensive comments on the blockade so far. In launching Apple Pay, the iPhone maker hopes to lock in more customers for its mobile devices by enhancing their overall utility. Industry experts say it stands a chance of becoming the first widely used payments feature on smartphones. CVS and Rite Aid have not explained their surprise move.     But the driving force behind developing a retailer-owned mobile payment solution is to avoid paying credit card transaction fees to card companies like Visa and Mastercard, analysts said. Fees range between 2 percent and 3 percent of costs per transaction. Rite Aid stopped accepting Apple Pay last week at its 4,572 stores. Spokeswoman Ashley Flower said the company was evaluating various forms of mobile payment technologies. CVS did not respond to queries seeking comment but a visit to two of its stores showed that the NFC (Near Field Communications) reader on which Apple Pay was used had been deactivated. It remains to be seen, despite early signs of success, whether mobile payments will become widely adopted. Cook argued on Monday that Apple Pay offered better security and privacy than competing services, and that retailers risked alienating customers by limiting choices at checkout. “It’s a skirmish,” Cook said in response to a question about the retailers’ moves. “Merchants have different objectives sometimes. But in the long arc of time, you only are relevant as a retailer or merchant if your customers love you.”        (Writing by Edwin Chan; Editing by Stephen Coates)",10282014,http://www.reuters.com/article/apple-payments/apple-ceo-fires-back-as-retailers-block-pay-idUSL1N0SN08920141028
284,V,Visa sees mobile payment as big growth driver,"(Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N) reported a better-than-expected adjusted quarterly profit and said the mobile payment industry would be “a great driver” for business, sending its shares up nearly 4 percent in extended trading. The world’s largest credit and debit card company and its competitors are turning their attention to mobile payments, an industry given fresh impetus by the entry of Apple Inc (AAPL.O). Visa, along with Mastercard Inc (MA.N) and American Express Co (AXP.N), have partnered with Apple in the launch of a system - Apple Pay - that allows iPhone users to pay for anything from office supplies to burgers at the tap of a button. Several analysts have estimated that mobile payments will be a $1 trillion global industry by 2017. “We have our traditional ways of doing business but ... we see the mobile opportunities in both the developing, the less developed and the developed world being great drivers,” Visa Chief Executive Charlie Scharf said on a conference call. The company, along with its smaller rival MasterCard, is looking to expand in emerging markets, where cash is still the preferred means of doing business. Earlier on Wednesday, China said it would open up its market for clearing domestic bank card transactions following its promise to reform and free its electronic payments market. The move is expected to benefit both Visa and MasterCard in a market worth over $1 trillion a year. Visa’s shares rose to $223 in extended trading on Wednesday. On a constant dollar basis, Visa forecast 2015 revenue growth in the low double digits in percentage terms. The company also announced a new $5 billion stock buyback program. Cross-border transactions grew 10 percent on a constant dollar basis in the fourth quarter. Payment volume growth rose 11 percent to $1.2 trillion on the same basis. “The quarter looked good. The most important thing is that we saw an improvement in cross-border transactions and the share buyback shows confidence,” said Gil Luria, analyst with Wedbush Securities Inc. On an adjusted basis, Visa’s net income rose 14 percent to $1.4 billion, or $2.18 per Class A share, for the quarter ended Sept. 30. Total operating revenue rose 8.6 percent to $3.23 billion. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $2.10 per share on revenue of $3.19 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

286,V,RPT-UPDATE 2-China to free clearing market for bank cards,"(Repeats to additional subscribers) * China to free up market for clearing bank card transactions * Move could benefit foreign firms such as Visa, Mastercard BEIJING, Oct 29 (Reuters) - China will open up its market for clearing domestic bank card transactions, the cabinet said on Wednesday, in a move that could benefit companies such as Visa Inc and Mastercard, in a booming market worth over $1 trillion a year. Access for foreign firms to China’s fast-growing electronic payments market is a controversial issue. China promised to reform and free its electronic payments market after the World Trade Organisation (WTO) said in 2012 that its behaviour discriminated against U.S. firms. Wednesday’s announcement by the State Council followed a weekly meeting. Foreign firms that meet its criteria could set up their own clearing companies, it added, but gave no further details. It was not immediately clear if the move would allow foreign firms to process credit and debit card payments made in yuan in China. Visa, the world’s largest credit and debit card company, welcomed the move. “We look forward to seeing the specific details and working with people within China to figure out what we need to do to participate in that marketplace, where we believe we can add a lot of value,” Chief Executive Charlie Scharf said on a conference call, following the release of its fourth-quarter earnings. In July 2012, the world trade body held that China had discriminated against U.S. bank card suppliers in its electronic payments market by favouring state behemoth China UnionPay, following a complaint to the WTO by the United States. The trade watchdog found that UnionPay had an illegal monopoly on yuan payment cards issued and used in China, but rejected the U.S. claim that UnionPay was an “across-the-board monopoly supplier” of all yuan transactions. As the world’s largest card brand with 3.53 billion cards in circulation since its founding in 2002, UnionPay’s rise came at a time of explosive growth in China’s interbank card market. Total bank card transactions leapt 37 percent to 21.8 trillion yuan ($3.6 trillion) in China in 2012, from 2011. China requires all foreign card companies to piggyback on UnionPay’s network when accepting yuan payments. This means firms such as Visa and Mastercard must give a cut of every credit or debit card transaction to UnionPay and the card issuing bank. In most other countries, the foreign card issuers pay only the bank because they use their own network. Wednesday’s promise to free a business sector is the latest step taken by China this year to free up the world’s second-largest economy, albeit in vague terms. The Chinese cabinet last month also said it was freeing up the domestic courier market, potentially opening the way to competition by firms such as FedEx Corp and United Parcel Services. But that announcement, like Wednesday’s, also gave no details, and it was unclear which curbs would be eased.

Major indexes were volatile following the central bank’s statement, with the S&P; 500 down as much as 0.8 percent before pulling back. Material shares were lower throughout the session, a decline in Facebook pressured the Nasdaq, but strength in energy and financial shares helped the market recover. In a statement after a two-day meeting, the Fed ended its quantitative easing program of bond purchases, as had been expected. At its peak, the program pumped $85 billion a month into the financial system. The Fed also dropped a characterization of U.S. labor market slack as “significant” in a show of confidence in the economy’s prospects. “The Fed had a little more of a hawkish bent than the market expected, but any weakness that came from the statement was obviously viewed as a buying opportunity,” said Alan Gayle, director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta, Georgia. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 31.44 points, or 0.18 percent, to 16,974.31, the S&P; 500 lost 2.75 points, or 0.14 percent, to 1,982.3 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 15.07 points, or 0.33 percent, to 4,549.23. Material shares fell 1.3 percent after DuPont  said there were “competitive advantages” to keeping its businesses together. Activist investor Nelson Peltz has urged DuPont to separate its various businesses in a move that has supported the company’s shares. Shares of DuPont lost 1.7 percent to $66.80. Facebook Inc fell 6.1 percent to $75.86 the day after the social network announced an increase in spending in 2015 and projected a slowdown in revenue growth this quarter. After the market closed, shares of Visa Inc rose 3.6 percent to $222.40. Visa reported its fourth-quarter results and announcing a stock buyback program of $5 billion. Despite the turn lower, equities mostly held onto recent gains, with the S&P; 500 up 6.4 percent over the last nine sessions as earnings have mostly been strong. So far this reporting season, 75.3 percent of S&P; 500 companies have exceeded profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, above the long-term average of 63 percent.

The New York Stock Exchange said it had experienced an outage in publishing and receiving trades and quotes on two of its exchanges, the latest incident to hit data processors key to trading. Within 10 minutes of the initial notification, the exchange released a statement that said the issue, which affected the NYSE and NYSE MKT exchanges, had been resolved. Traders noted that a sudden, huge surge in equity futures volume occurred concurrently with the problems, but could not say whether it was related. Despite the outage, trading in NYSE-listed securities appeared to be relatively unaffected, with steady volume still seen in those issues. Overall volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.9 billion, below the daily average so far this month of 7.8 billion, according to BATS Global Markets data.

Gains on the S&P; 500 were led by the year’s best performing sectors, healthcare and utilities. Analysts cited buying of winning stocks from mutual funds for the run in those sectors, as funds close their books for the year at the end of this month. “End of year for mutual funds is most likely going to be selling losers and continue to buy winners,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.

A separate report showed first-time applications for unemployment benefits rose marginally last week, but a measure of underlying trends hit its lowest level since May 2000 in a show of labor market strength. Adding to support from earnings and economic data, market participants cited a report from the Nikkei newspaper that confirmed expectations that Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund, the world’s largest public pension, would cut holdings of Japanese bonds and add to equities. The iShares MSCI Japan ETF gained 1.1 percent and U.S. dollar denominated Nikkei futures gained 1.3 percent. “The more you hear demand for equities picking up globally, that is going to be a net positive for U.S. equities,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. “If you look globally, growth is here in the United States,” she said.

China’s decision to open up its $1 trillion a year domestic bank card market to foreign companies should further benefit the company and its larger rival Visa Inc. “We are pleased with the announcement and see it as a good step in the right direction,” MasterCard Chief Executive Ajay Banga said on a post-earnings conference call. MasterCard’s shares were up 7 percent at $81.25 in midday trading. Visa was up 8.7 percent, the biggest gainer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Thursday. MasterCard has a bigger exposure to global markets than Visa, deriving nearly 60 percent of its revenue from its international business. Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria said if the two companies were to grow at their current rate, they would need big new opportunities and China was one of them. MasterCard’s worldwide purchase volume, excluding the United States, grew 12.8 percent to $554 billion on local currency basis in the third quarter. The company’s cross-border volume fees rose 14 percent to $835 million. The two companies also benefited from a rise in global consumer confidence. A Nielsen survey showed that concerns about the economy and job prospects had eased globally in the three months ended September from the second quarter. U.S. consumer confidence rose in August to its highest level since October 2007. Visa, which reported a better-than-expected adjusted quarterly profit on Wednesday, said cross-border transactions increased 10 percent. MasterCard’s net income rose to $1.02 billion, or 87 cents per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from $879 million, or 73 cents per share, a year earlier. Net revenue rose 12.8 percent to $2.5 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 78 cents per share on revenue of $2.45 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. MasterCard and Visa are also turning their attention to mobile payments and have partnered with Apple Inc in the launch of Apple Pay, which allows iPhone users to pay using their phones. Chief Executive Ajay Banga said the company planned to use mobile-based payments as a key tool of its cash displacement efforts.

298,V,GLOBAL MARKETS-Dollar surges as Fed ends QE on hawkish note,"* Dollar, yields jump after Fed ends QE * Global equity markets mixed * Fed statement more hawkish than markets had expected   (Recasts lead, adds U.S. open, adds Visa, changes dateline, previously LONDON) By Yasmeen Abutaleb NEW YORK, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Global equity markets were mixed on Thursday while the dollar surged to a three-week high and government bond yields rose, one day after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced the end of its six-year bond-buying stimulus program. The Fed, as expected, said it would no longer add to its holdings of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, effectively ending a program that at its peak pumped $85 billion a month into the financial system to hold interest rates down and boost the flagging economy. Less expected was the Fed’s expression of confidence in the U.S. recovery, despite global growth concerns, which prompted financial markets to rethink the growing consensus that the Fed’s first interest rate hike would be late in 2015. The Fed did note in its statement Wednesday after a two-day meeting that overnight borrowing costs would remain near zero for a “considerable time.” “The tone in the statement was relatively more hawkish than had been anticipated,” said Mohannad Aama, managing director of Beam Capital Management LLC in New York. “The FX markets have concluded an interest rate hike is going to happen probably sooner rather than later.” The dollar jumped 0.3 percent against a basket of six major currencies and rose 0.2 percent against the euro to $1.2602.

Oil also fell, with U.S. and Brent crude futures down more than 1 percent to $81.02 and $86.20 a barrel, respectively. Brazil surprised markets late on Wednesday by hiking interest rates, a bold move that signals President Dilma Rousseff may make market-friendly policy changes after her narrow re-election victory on Sunday. The rate hike could give the Brazilian real a further lift. It fell to a nine-year low against the dollar on Monday after Rousseff defeated market-friendly challenger Aecio Neves, but pared losses as some of the pessimism faded.

300,V,"Visa, Mastercard welcome Beijing's plans to free bank cards market","BEIJING (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N) and Mastercard Inc (MA.N) welcome China’s plans to open up its market for clearing domestic bank card transactions, as they stand to gain access to a growing market worth more than $1 trillion a year.   While China lags behind countries such as the United States in spending on credit, habits are changing fast and the Chinese are increasingly swiping plastic to satisfy their growing appetite for consumer goods. The State Council, China’s cabinet, said on Wednesday after a weekly meeting that foreign firms that meet its criteria could set up their own clearing companies. It did not provide details. Visa, the world’s largest credit and debit card company, welcomed the move. “We look forward to seeing the specific details and working with people within China to figure out what we need to do to participate in that marketplace, where we believe we can add a lot of value,” Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf said on a conference call, following the release of its fourth-quarter earnings. Household debt in China amounted to just 37 percent of GDP at the end of July, compared with 81 percent in the United States.  But the Chinese, renowned for being thrifty, are changing fast.  China’s total outstanding credit card balances, while less than 10 percent of household debt, were a third higher at the end of June than a year ago, according to the People’s Bank of China. The amount outstanding per card has increased by more than two-thirds in two years. Mastercard, the second-largest payments company globally, also welcomes the opportunity to expand in the world’s second-largest economy. “We will continue to monitor closely and look forward to the day when we can compete for domestic business in China,” MasterCard said in a statement emailed to Reuters on Thursday. The explosion in online retailers, fueled by increasingly well-heeled youth, is adding to the allure of plastic.  Access for foreign firms to China’s fast-growing electronic payments market is a controversial issue.  China promised to reform and free its electronic payments market after the World Trade Organization (WTO) said in 2012 that its behavior discriminated against U.S. firms. It was not immediately clear if the move would allow foreign firms to process credit and debit card payments made in yuan in China.  In July 2012, the world trade body held that China had discriminated against U.S. bank card suppliers in its electronic payments market by favoring state behemoth China UnionPay, following a complaint to the WTO by the United States. The trade watchdog found that UnionPay had an illegal monopoly on yuan payment cards issued and used in China, but rejected the U.S. claim that UnionPay was an “across-the-board monopoly supplier.     “As a market-orientated business, China UnionPay will operate under the same regulations as other banks, to ensure equal market competition in a way that complies with the law,” said UnionPay in a statement emailed to Reuters on Thursday.     As the world’s largest card brand with 3.53 billion cards in circulation since its founding in 2002, UnionPay’s rise came at a time of explosive growth in China’s interbank card market.  Total bank card transactions leapt 37 percent to 21.8 trillion yuan ($3.6 trillion) in China in 2012, from 2011. China requires all foreign card companies to piggyback on UnionPay’s network when accepting yuan payments.  This means firms such as Visa and Mastercard must give a cut of every credit or debit card transaction to UnionPay and the card issuing bank. In most other countries, the foreign card issuers pay only the bank because they use their own network. Wednesday’s promise to free a business sector is the latest step taken by China this year to open up its financial markets.  The Chinese cabinet last month also said it was freeing up the domestic courier market, potentially opening the way to competition by firms such as FedEx Corp (FDX.N) and United Parcel Services (UPS.N).  But that announcement, like Wednesday’s, also gave no details, and it was unclear which curbs would be eased.

302,V,"UPDATE 2-MasterCard, Visa to cut fees for Canadian merchants, govt says","(Adds opposition politician, analyst comment) TORONTO, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc  voluntarily agreed to cut the fees they charge to Canadian retailers for credit transactions, the government said on Tuesday, adding it now sees no need to regulate fees set by credit card networks. The Canadian government said the agreement, which industry sources last week confirmed was in the works, should result in lower prices for consumers. Canadian retailers have long bemoaned the high interchange fees they pay credit card companies and banks for transactions. Unlike American Express, which typically negotiates a flat fee with every merchant, Visa and MasterCard have variable fees based on the status of their different cards. Small retailers say this hurts them as they are never sure on whether they are going to be billed 1 or 3 percent on any given transaction. Canada’s Conservative government pledged earlier this year to promote lower credit card acceptance costs for merchants. And Finance Minister Joe Oliver said in September the government wanted credit card companies and banks to voluntarily agree to a deal. On Tuesday Oliver said he welcomed the decision, which will trim fees to an average effective rate of 1.5 percent for the next five years, reducing overall fees by about 10 percent. “As a result of the voluntary proposals, there is no need for the government to regulate the interchange rates,” the government said, adding that Visa and MasterCard have agreed to start implementing the reductions no later than April. The deal was panned by Canada’s main opposition party, who said the move let down consumers or small businesses and noted that Canada’s Competition Tribunal had specifically called on the government to regulate the fees. “We can’t allow companies to set their own disciplinary measures,” New Democrat parliamentarian Annick Papillon said in a statement, dubbing the government’s decision a “shameful climb-down.” Although the long anticipated fee reduction is likely to eat slightly into the bottom line of the Canadian banks, analysts expect a limited impact. “We believe potential changes to interchange fees represent a modest but transitory headwind to the group, with a greater impact to TD and CIBC, and the least impact to Scotia and Royal (Bank),” Barclays analyst John Aiken wrote in a note to clients. Aiken noted there are several ways the banks can mitigate the impact of the reduction, including by increasing annual fees on cards and reducing the benefits of loyalty programs. A spokesman for Royal Bank of Canada said the bank was still assessing the impact of the changes, but was well positioned to make any adjustments required. Shares in Aimia, operator of the Aeroplan loyalty program, had been weighed down by the prospect of a lower fee structure. But the stock rose 4.6 percent on Tuesday, suggesting investors do not see the changes crimping the popular reward program offered by certain banks on some credit cards.

305,V,Online threat to China's UnionPay outweighs foreign card rivals,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese bank card operator UnionPay, which may soon have to defend its near monopoly against Visa and MasterCard, faces a much bigger threat from online payment providers such as Alipay, and is upgrading its systems to meet the danger. Shored up by a raft of protectionist measures, the state-backed company has grown in just over a decade from an unknown name to a true heavyweight, commanding 50.6 percent of all the global cards in circulation in 2013, according to the Nilson Report statistics newsletter. China said last month it would open its credit card market to foreign players following a World Trade Organization ruling in 2012 that it discriminated against U.S. card firms. The prize for the foreign companies would be access to what is projected to become the biggest card market in the world by 2020. Transactions were already around 32 trillion yuan ($5.22 trillion) in China in 2013, according to data from the People’s Bank of China. But analysts say the obstacles to a successful foreign invasion of UnionPay’s dominant card position are considerable, as UnionPay charges merchants much lower rates than the Western card companies - as low as 0.04 percent, compared with MasterCard’s 0.60-1.85 percent in Britain for certain cards. “The low rates in China will make entry by foreign players extremely difficult as business cases will not stack up, based on the lower rates,” said James McKeogh, a partner in consulting at KPMG China.     A more immediate and perilous threat comes from online payment firms like Alipay, a unit of giant e-commerce company Alibaba, which already dominates a parallel and growing payment universe that rivals the traditional card set-up. In less than three years, Alipay has grown to control nearly half of China’s online third-party payment market, tapping the hundreds of millions of Chinese still without a credit card. That market commanded gross merchandise volume of 17.2 trillion yuan ($2.8 trillion) in 2013, according to estimates from iResearch. UnionPay, on the other hand, commands a mere 11.9 percent of that market and faces competition from over 250 new online providers that have been awarded licenses from Beijing as it aims to stimulate consumer demand. Alibaba told Bloomberg on Wednesday it was open to working with eBay Inc’s PayPal to expand its payment options, a plan that could magnify Alipay’s reach and put further pressure on UnionPay.  With the opening of the market, Li Ye, an analyst at Analysys International, believes that with government support, Alipay could even challenge UnionPay’s offline payment dominance. “Alipay is well placed to become the next UnionPay,” said Li. UnionPay is nevertheless putting up a fight. Last month it started working with airlines Lufthansa, Emirates [EMIRA.UL], Etihad and Air Holland to provide payment services for online airline tickets through its cards for the first time.     In September, it teamed up with Samsung in near-field-communication payment (NFC), which lets users pay by tapping their phones on a device available at local shops. UnionPay’s company spokesman said it plans to “deepen its transformation into a market-orientated firm. And embrace market competition.” But Alipay is also trying to clinch a deal with Apple on its own NFC payment system, a senior executive from Alibaba told the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. Alipay also has the advantage of being at the heart of the freewheeling, profitable and fast-growing Alibaba empire, which just eight weeks ago pulled off the world’s biggest-ever IPO in New York.

311,V,UK consumer spending rises as 'Black Friday' crosses Atlantic: Visa,"LONDON (Reuters) - British consumer spending grew strongly in November after many big retailers adopted U.S.-style “Black Friday” promotions, payments company Visa Europe said on Monday, suggesting spending for 2014 as a whole may rise at its fastest rate since 2010. Echoing other data which have pointed to the robustness of Britain’s economic recovery, Visa’s UK expenditure index showed household spending rose at its fastest annual rate since August, up 2.0 percent after inflation versus 1.4 percent in October. Spending rose by 1.6 percent month-on-month in November, picking up from October’s 0.5 percent monthly growth rate. Last week the Bank of England said consumers increased borrowing at the most rapid pace since 2006 in October, while earlier official data showed household spending in the three months to September rising at its fastest in four years. “With Christmas just around the corner, consumer appetite remains positive, suggesting overall spending (growth) this year looks set to reach levels not seen since 2010,” said Kevin Jenkins, a senior Visa Europe executive. Results for the high street, where spending grew at the second-fastest annual rate since July 2010, were especially impressive, with shops benefiting from Black Friday sales which kick-started trading in the Christmas period. This year several British retailers fully embraced the U.S.-born shopping frenzy for the first time, leading to surging crowds, fights and record sales for some, such as Britain’s largest department store group John Lewis. By contrast, online spending last month was lower than a year earlier, though the decline was less than in October. The fastest spending growth was seen in hotels, restaurants and bars, where sales are more than 10 percent higher than a year ago, while the biggest falls came at businesses such as hairdressers and jewelers.  The Visa data is based on credit and debit card transactions that account for around a third of all spending in Britain.

313,V,UPDATE 1-EU agrees deal to cap bank card payment fees,"(Writes through, adds comment from EU Commissioner, Visa) By Jan Strupczewski and Foo Yun Chee BRUSSELS, Dec 18 (Reuters) - European Union governments have agreed to cap the fees retailers pay to process debit and credit card transactions in a move the EU parliament said should bring down costs for customers. Negotiators from European governments and the economic committee of the EU parliament agreed late on Wednesday to cap charges across the 28 countries in the union following a long battle over charges with payments groups, including Visa  and MasterCard. The cap would apply to both cross-border and domestic card-based payments which cost businesses across the EU around 10 billion euros ($12.3 billion) a year. The fees are opaque and differ from country to country. Retailers are charged for every card transaction and add the costs to the prices of the goods or services they offer. “This legislation is good for consumers, good for business, and good for Europe. It will lead to lower prices and visibility of costs for consumers,” said Margrethe Vestager, commissioner in charge of competition policy. She said the interchange fee was a “tax” levied on business by banks and the price cap should release “the brakes that have so far held back innovation.” Visa said clarity on the fees was welcome, but warned it could hurt the cards industry and said there was no guarantee that retailers would pass on the savings to consumers. “We continue to have serious concerns that the regulation will have unintended consequences, particularly for consumers, and that it could stifle future innovation,” Visa said in a statement. The European parliament said credit card fees will be capped at 0.3 percent of the transaction value. Cross-border debit card fees will be capped at 0.2 percent of the transaction value, and domestic debit card fees will be capped at 0.2 percent of the annual weighted average transaction value of all domestic transactions within the card scheme. Fees charged by banks belonging to card schemes such as Visa and MasterCard, so-called four-party schemes involving the bank who issued the card, the retailer, the retailer’s bank and the card user, will be affected by the cap. They account for the lion’s share of the market. The price cap will not initially apply to the so-called three-party card schemes, such as Diners and American Express, which involve only one bank. Retailers will also be free to choose which cards to accept, effectively ending the so-called ‘Honour All Cards’ rule. Visa said that could be bad for consumers if they are unsure if their card will be accepted. Commercial cards used only for business expenses would be exempt from the new price cap. These caps will take effect six months after the legislation enters into force. It first needs to be endorsed by EU governments and by the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, before being put to a vote by the full parliament next year. Regulators in individual EU countries are also investigating the cards industry. In Britain, where 70 percent of Europe’s credit cards are held, the financial watchdog is assessing the way cards are sold amid concerns that poorer customers are trapped in a spiral of debt on their cards.

314,V,"WRAPUP 2-Kiev, rebels exchange POWs; trains, buses to Crimea suspended","(Adds presidential spokesman comments, paragraph 7; updates prisoner totals, paragraph 2) * Bus, train suspension creates Crimea transport blockade * Prisoner swap follows talks on Wednesday * Visa, Mastercard stop supporting bank cards in Crimea By Pavel Polityuk and Alessandra  Prentice KIEV, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Ukraine’s government and pro-Russian separatists on Friday exchanged hundreds of prisoners of war while Kiev said it would suspend all train and bus service to Crimea, effectively creating a transportation blockade to and from the region. The agreement to swap 150 Ukrainian servicemen for 222 rebels followed peace talks between envoys of Ukraine, Russia, the separatists and European security watchdog Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) on Wednesday. Ukrainian transportation chiefs said the reason for suspending train and bus service was the need to protect passengers due to a “deteriorating” security situation on the Black Sea peninsula, annexed by Russia in March. Crimea is controlled by Russia, but its only land link is with Ukraine and it has remained dependent on the Ukrainian mainland for most of its supplies, including much of its electricity and water. Ukraine already has banned sea and air traffic with Crimea, which is still serviced by Russian airlines. Other road transportation including passenger cars and trucks will still be allowed to travel into and out of Crimea. State rail company Ukrzaliznytsia said cargo trains would be suspended beginning on Friday, while passenger routes would gradually cease running over the weekend and on Monday. “The head of the SBU (security service) reported the release of 146 Ukrainians to the President. The SBU expects another four prisoners to be released tomorrow. They will all be able to celebrate New Year ... with their families,” Svyatoslav Tsegolko, a spokesman for President Petro Poroshenko, said in a Facebook post. Earlier, an SBU aide had said they would hand over 225 rebels for the Ukrainian servicemen. It is not known exactly how many prisoners are held by the two sides, but Ukraine’s military said this month about 600 Ukrainians were in rebel hands. In addition, Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc, the world’s two largest credit and debit card companies, said they could no longer support bank cards being used in Crimea  following U.S. sanctions imposed earlier this month. The United States last Friday prohibited U.S.-registered companies from investing in Crimea or providing services to companies operating there, among measures imposed over Russia’s annexation of the peninsula from Ukraine. Russia’s takeover of Crimea, an annexation Kiev does not recognise, pushed relations between Moscow and the West to their lowest point since the Cold War. Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a new military doctrine, naming NATO expansion among key external risks, the Kremlin said on Friday, days after Ukraine made fresh steps to join the Atlantic military alliance. The uprising by separatists began a month after Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine in March, following the popular overthrow of Ukraine’s Moscow-backed president. The conflict has killed more than 4,700 people. Kiev’s pro-Western government has said Russia orchestrated the rebellion in Ukraine’s east, a charge denied by Moscow. Violence arising from Kiev’s conflict with pro-Russian separatists has been confined almost exclusively to eastern regions of Ukraine and has not affected Crimea. But the Ukrainian government has repeatedly warned of a build-up of Russian forces on the peninsula.

The stock was the second-biggest loser on the London Stock Exchange. “The market is telling us that investors very much doubt that Monitise will find a proper buyer,” said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Alexandre Faure. “IBM is going to be probably the most speculated buyer,” Faure added, saying other potential bidders included MasterCard Inc and other banking software vendors eyeing Monitise’s high profile relationships, if not their technology. The company provides payment solutions to 350 financial institutions, including Royal Bank of Scotland, MasterCard and Santander. Monitise also said on Thursday that it expected a full-year EBITDA loss of between $60 million and $76 million, wider than market estimates. Prior to the announcement, the company’s 2015 EBITDA loss was forecast at 33.24 million pounds ($50.4 million), according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. However, the company said it still expected an EBITDA profit in 2016, helped by cost savings from the re-shaping of the business. Monitise, which warned on revenue twice last year citing the same changes to its business model, has shed over 70 percent of its market value since the start of 2014. The company was also hit hard in September when its biggest customer, Visa Inc, revealed plans to divest its stake in Monitise and pursue its own mobile payment systems. Monitise said it now expected full-year revenue to be between $136 million and $151 million, compared with its previous forecast of an “at least 25 percent growth” on its revenue of $143.7 million in the year ended June 30, 2014. The company’s AIM-listed shares recovered some of their early losses and were down 10 percent at 0923 GMT.

319,V,Cheaper gasoline helps Visa report better-than-expected profit,"(Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N), the world’s largest credit and debit card company, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday as a strengthening U.S. job market and cheaper gasoline prices encouraged people to spend. The company said e-commerce, which mainly uses cards, was “extraordinarily strong during the holiday season.” But Chief Executive Charlie Scharf said consumer spending on the whole, while at “reasonable” levels, was not accelerating. Shares of the company, which also announced a 4-for-1 split of its class A common stock, rose about 4 percent in extended trading. Visa, which earns money from both the volume and value of transactions using its cards, said total volume increased to $1.90 trillion from $1.84 trillion. The company stands to benefit from China’s recent decision to allow foreign card networks to clear domestic transactions, but Scharf said it remained unclear when the Chinese market would actually open and what the rules would look like. Visa lost its right to process domestic payments in Russia in the middle of last year when Moscow hit back after the imposition of Western sanctions over its role in Ukraine. Visa reaffirmed its revenue and margin forecasts for 2015 after taking into account an expected 2 percentage point negative impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. About 60 percent of Visa’s transaction volumes are outside the United States. “The stronger-than-anticipated U.S. dollar has led to substantially reduced travel into the U.S. from Europe, Canada, and Latin America,” Chief Financial Officer Byron Pollitt said on a conference call with analysts. Visa, a Dow Jones Industrial Average component, recorded cross-border volume growth of 8 percent on a constant dollar basis, down from 12 percent in the year-earlier quarter. The company’s net income rose to $1.57 billion, or $2.53 per Class A share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31 from $1.41 billion, or $2.20 per Class A share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $2.49 per share on revenue of $3.34 billion for the company’s first fiscal quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total operating revenue rose 7 percent to $3.38 billion. Up to Thursday's close of $248, Visa's shares had gained about 15.5 percent since it last reported earnings on Oct. 29. The Dow Jones Industrial average .DJI rose about 2.6 percent in the same period.

The S&P; 500 had fallen as much as 0.6 percent earlier, led by energy stocks, which reversed direction along with oil. While the afternoon rise in crude was not huge, it was enough to cheer up the market, said Randy Frederick, managing director at Charles Schwab in Austin. “Technically the market was a little oversold, so we were in a pretty good position to bounce, so we just needed a little bit of positive news to spark an afternoon rally,” he said. The market has been advancing and retreating within a range of 200 to 300 points for some time as traders grapple with mixed earnings, a strong dollar and weak oil prices as well as interest rate uncertainty, said Dennis Dick, head of markets structure at Bright Trading LLC. “There’s a lot technical trading going on,” he said. “When the fundamentals are confusing and the macro is confusing, you have to lean on the technicals.” Investors also continued to digest Wednesday’s Federal Reserve statement, which failed to clarify when rates would rise. Senate Democrats said Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen told them at a private meeting this afternoon that the U.S. economy is strong but the U.S. was not going to raise rates immediately, according to reports. Shares in Visa Inc rose 4.4 percent after the market closed when it reported better than expected earnings and a 4-for-1 split of its class A common stock. Harman International shares rose 23.8 percent, making it the top S&P; gainer after it beat profit and revenue expectations. Dow component McDonald’s  added 5 percent after announcing its CEO’s retirement. Shares in Chinese internet giant Alibaba Group fell 8.8 percent after revenue missed expectations and Qualcomm  fell 10.3 percent after trimming its 2015 outlook. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 225.48 points, or 1.31 percent, to 17,416.85, the S&P; 500 gained 19.09 points, or 0.95 percent, to 2,021.25 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 45.41 points, or 0.98 percent, to 4,683.41. Apple Inc closed up 3.1 percent and Boeing Co  finished 5.8 percent higher. Supporting stocks, data showed weekly applications for unemployment insurance fell to their lowest in almost 15 years, adding to bullish signals on the labor market. The energy sector finished up 0.17 percent with U.S. crude oil turning around to settle up 8 cents at $44.53.

The S&P; energy sector was up 1.5 percent at 2:30 p.m. ET (1930 GMT) after falling as much as 1.5 percent earlier in the session. The rebound came as crude futures rose 8 percent following a survey that showed that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States fell by 94 this week, the biggest decline since 1987. Also, concerns over fighting in Iraq extended short covering from the previous session. U.S. crude futures settled at $48.24 per barrel, up $3.71, hitting a level not seen since Jan. 22. On top of this, investors may be making some changes as the month draws to a close, said Brian Lazorishak, senior portfolio manager at Chase Investment Counsel. “You might have a little technical action,” he said. “It seems like an oversold bounce.” At 2:33 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average fell 30.41 points, or 0.17 percent, to 17,386.44, the S&P; 500  lost 0.66 points, or 0.03 percent, to 2,020.59 and the Nasdaq Composite added 8.04 points, or 0.17 percent, to 4,691.45. If the S&P; closes January in the red, it would be its first back-to-back monthly decline since April-May 2012. Earlier in the session, the market was under pressure from signs that U.S. economic growth slowed sharply in the fourth quarter as weak business spending and a wider trade deficit offset the fastest pace of consumer spending since 2006. “It’s just a little disheartening to see the U.S. didn’t have such a great quarter and it puts a little bit of fear in the minds of the people,” said Joseph Benanti, managing director for sales and trading at Rosenblatt Securities in New York. Adding to concerns, Greece’s finance minister said the government would not cooperate with the European Union and International Monetary Fund mission bankrolling the country and would not seek an extension of the bailout program. Consumer spending was a bright spot as data showed U.S. consumer sentiment rose in January to its highest in 11 years on better job and wage prospects. That confidence appeared to be reflected in some corporate results. Amazon shares jumped 14.7 percent after earnings that beat Wall Street expectations on strong holiday season sales. In contrast to the broader market on Friday, shares in newly public burger restaurant Shake Shack rose more than 130 percent to $48.35 in their first day of trading.

327,V,American Express card rules violated U.S. antitrust law - judge,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - American Express Co violated U.S. antitrust law by prohibiting merchants from steering consumers to use lower-cost credit cards, a federal judge ruled on Thursday, in the company’s second major setback this month. The decision by U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn followed American Express’ loss on Feb. 12 of a lucrative, exclusive partnership with warehouse retailer Costco Wholesale Corp. It is also a victory for the U.S. government and 17 states, which in 2010 sued American Express over allegations it forbade merchants from recommending to consumers which cards to use. The New York-based company’s activities “imposed actual, concrete harms on competition in the credit and charge card network services market,” Garaufis wrote in a 150-page decision. He said he will decide on remedies later. American Express shares fell 1.7 percent. Card companies charge merchants more than $50 billion a year to process consumer transactions, the government said. Those fees have also spurred many years of litigation by the merchants themselves against the card companies. “Today’s decision is a triumph for fair competition and for American consumers,” U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement. “By recognizing that American Express’s rules harm competition, the court vindicates the promise of robust marketplaces that is enshrined in our antitrust laws.” American Express said it will appeal, and that Garaufis’ decision would harm competition by “further entrenching the two dominant payment networks,” Visa and MasterCard. “We believe that freedom of choice and fair competition are worth defending,” American Express said. Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc had also been sued by the various governments over their “anti-steering” rules for merchants, but settled in 2011 by agreeing to make changes. “Large retailers can save a good chunk of money by encouraging customers to use cards like Visa and MasterCard,” said Matt Schulz, senior industry analyst at CreditCards.com, an online marketplace. “If a large retailer can go from paying 5 percent on a transaction to even 4 percent, that is a lot.” American Express has said its “premium” services justify its processing fees, which are higher than some rivals charge. It also said its merchant rules help it compete with Visa and MasterCard, which together have more than 1.1 billion cards in the United States versus 55 million for American Express. Garaufis, however, said American Express wrongfully exploited its 26.4 percent share of purchase volume in the U.S. credit and charge card market by banning merchants from giving incentives for consumers to use one card over another, or telling consumers they might be better off if they did. “There is nothing to offset credit card networks’ incentives - including American Express’s incentive - to charge merchants inflated prices for their services,” the judge wrote. “This, in turn, results in higher costs to all consumers who purchase goods and services from these merchants.” Douglas Kantor, a partner at Steptoe & Johnson who represents the National Association of Convenience Stores,  welcomed the decision. “It ought to open up the marketplace for more price competition where there isn’t any at all today,” he said in an interview. “That helps merchants and consumers, because it can help keep prices down, and spur spending and economic activity.” Richard Dagen, an antitrust partner at Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider, said the decision may make it easier for small or new rivals to compete with American Express, Visa and MasterCard. “You might have a chance for someone like Discover to make inroads,” he said, referring to Discover Financial Services . “Whenever that happens, you’re likely to see lower prices for the merchants, which hopefully get passed on to consumers.” Garaufis ruled after presiding over a seven-week non-jury trial last summer. The lawsuit sought to force American Express to give merchants who accept its cards the freedom to encourage consumers “to use any payment method they choose.” No money damages were sought, but American Express has said a loss could have a “material adverse effect” on its business. That could add to the loss of earnings stemming from the demise of its partnership with Costco, which began in 1999 and will end in March 2016. American Express is the only credit payment form accepted at Costco’s U.S. stores. Costco last year decided to replace American Express as its card partner in Canada with MasterCard and Capital One Financial Corp. Shares of American Express closed down $1.38 at $78.40. Visa fell 2 cents to $269.10, and MasterCard rose $1.47 to $89.20. The case is U.S. et al v. American Express Co et al.

329,V,"UPDATE 1-Samsung buys startup LoopPay, moves toward mobile payments","(Adds executives’ comments, details on upcoming payments service and industry) By Abhirup Roy and Edwin Chan Feb 18 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  has bought U.S. mobile wallet startup LoopPay, signalling its intention to launch a smartphone payments service to compete with a recent offering from rival Apple Inc. Mobile payments have been slow to catch on in the United States and elsewhere, despite strong backing. Apple, Google , and eBay Inc’s PayPal have all launched services to allow users to pay in stores via smartphones. The weak uptake is partly because many retailers have been reluctant to adopt the hardware and software infrastructure required for these new mobile payment options to work. These services also fail to offer much more convenience than simply swiping a credit card, Samsung executives said on Wednesday. LoopPay’s technology differs because it works off existing magnetic-stripe card readers at checkout, changing them into contactless receivers, they said. About 90 percent of checkout counters already support magnetic swiping. “If you can’t solve the problem of merchant acceptance..., of being able to use the vast majority of your cards, then it can’t really be your wallet,” said David Eun, head of Samsung’s Global Innovation Center. Injong Rhee, who is leading Samsung’s as-yet-unannounced payments project, said the Asian giant will soon reveal more details of its envisioned service. He would not be drawn on speculation the company may do so during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. He said new phones such as the upcoming, latest Galaxy would support the service. Apple Pay, launched in September, allows iPhone users to pay at the tap of a button. Executives have lauded its rapid rollout so far, including the fact that more than 2,000 banks now support it and the U.S. government will accept Apple Pay later this year. But Apple Pay requires retailers to install near-field communication and some have been reluctant. In addition, many retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc and CVS Health Corp, back their own system, CurrentC. Samsung had invested in LoopPay, along with Visa Inc  and Synchrony Financial, before its acquisition. Terms of the deal, which Samsung negotiated over several months, were not disclosed on Wednesday. It’s unclear how else Samsung could differentiate its service versus Apple’s or other rivals.

330,V,Visa Europe plans new security that could pave way for Apple Pay,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Visa Europe has announced a new, more secure way for consumers to pay retailers via smartphones, a move that could set the stage for Apple’s (AAPL.O) Apple Pay and rival mobile payment services to be introduced into Europe in the coming months. Visa Europe said on Tuesday it would introduce to member banks by mid-April a “tokenisation” service which substitutes random numbers for a user’s credit card details when a merchant transmits transaction data, reducing the risk of online theft. Similar security from Visa Inc (V.N), the former parent of Visa Europe, and rival card issuers MasterCard (MA.N) and American Express (AXP.N) has been key to the success of Apple Pay since it was introduced in the United States last year, according to industry experts. Apple Pay allows iPhone users to store their credit card details on their phones, then pay at the tap of a button. In its first three months, more than $2 out of every $3 which U.S. consumers spent using speedy new “contactless” systems at the three major credit card networks was done via Apple Pay, the company said last month. Visa Europe’s move is one of several new services the London-based credit card giant is unveiling as it battles to retain its role as a middleman connecting banks and consumers in a fast-moving payments landscape being shaken up by major technology firms including Apple, Google (GOOGL.O) and eBay’s (EBAY.O) PayPal, as well as scores of ambitious start-ups. These include a way for card customers to send money overseas to other Visa users via their social media profiles on sites such as Facebook (FB.O), WhatsApp, Twitter (TWTR.N) or LinkedIn LNKD.N. Steve Perry, Visa Europe’s chief digital officer, said in an interview his association’s plan for secure credit card data transmission parallels what Visa Inc offers in the United States. But he declined to comment on whether Apple Pay had agreed to use his organization’s version in European markets.        “Apple and Visa (Inc) have an agreement around what has happened,” Perry said. “I am as excited as anyone, but we have to wait,” he said. The Visa Europe executive referred further questions to Apple. An Apple spokesman was not immediately available to comment on any international expansion plans it might have. Visa Europe, which since 2007 has operated independently of Visa Inc, is a cooperative of more than 3,700 European banks with more than 500 million cards in circulation. Its plans also include opening a mobile app store for its members to pick and choose payment apps that they can assemble into mobile banking services they offer their own customers. The company said it would introduce by this summer a global peer-to-peer payments service called Visa Direct, which was formerly known as Visa Personal Payments and offered on a limited basis. Visa Europe has partnered with Singapore-based Fastacash to enable its member banks to soon start sending peer-to-peer payments via popular social media services. Visa Direct will allow Visa Europe card users to transfer funds in multiple currencies to the mobile phone numbers of nearly 2 billion other Visa card holders. The personal money transfer service, which complies with “Know your customer” banking regulations and other international rules, will not be available in the United States, Japan or nations sanctioned by U.S. Treasury Department, it said.

332,V,"Costco ties up with Citigroup, Visa for U.S. co-branded cards","(Reuters) - Warehouse club Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) has chosen Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Visa Inc (V.N) to run its co-branded credit card starting next year, replacing American Express Co (AXP.N), which lost the coveted tie-up last month. Citigroup will exclusively issue the Costco branded cards and Visa will provide the payment network in the United States and Puerto Rico from April 1, 2016, Costco said. The deal means that Costco customers will only be able to use Visa credit cards at its stores, as is currently true with American Express cards. While terms were not disclosed, the high profile partnership could be lucrative for both companies given that Costco caters to relatively high-income customers compared with Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N). Still, margins on such deals can be thin. American Express said in February that it had been unable to reach a deal with Costco that would have made “economic sense” even though the loss of the contract would hurt its earnings for the next two years. The Costco portfolio of card loans has been a “thin margin” business, but Citigroup - the world’s largest credit card issuer - has the scale, with some $146 billion of card loans, to manage it, analyst Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI wrote in a note.   Visa shares rose 2 percent to a record high of $277.00 in early trading, while Citi shares rose 1.5 percent to $53.22. “Costco is a solid co-brand partner given its affluent, captive member base and represents a solid win for Visa,”  J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Tien-tsin Huang wrote in a note. Citigroup Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said an investor conference that the bank is attracted to Costco’s “loyal customer base.” Stifel Nicolaus and Co Inc analyst John Davis said it was an “impressive win” for Visa, considering that 90 percent of Citi’s U.S. credit cards are MasterCards. The deal is expected to add $120 million of annual revenue  to Visa or roughly about 10 cents in earnings per share, Davis added. Costco, which sells everything from jewelry to fresh produce at its cavernous members-only stores, had already replaced AmEx with Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) as its card partner in Canada since the start of this  year. That move had raised speculation that the same companies could also replace AmEx in the United States.

337,V,"Visa to miss deadline for new Russia payment system, Mastercard on time: payment system head","MOSCOW, March 27 (Reuters) - Visa still needs one or two months to transfer processing of transactions made on its credit cards in Russia to a local payment system, but Mastercard will make an obligatory April 1 deadline, the head of the payment system said. Russian authorities ordered foreign card companies to move processing of their transactions in Russia to a newly created local payment system by April 1 or put down a hefty security deposit. The new rules were introduced after Visa and Mastercard stopped providing services for some Russian banks that were sanctioned over Moscow’s role in the Ukraine crisis. “With Mastercard the project is completed, all the banks are signed up. With Visa there is a fully fledged project, which has been agreed. Signing up and certifying the banks is under way,” Vladimir Komlev told journalists in comments agreed for publication on Friday. “There is an understanding of the time frame (for Visa) to complete the project, around one to two months.” Foreign card companies whose local transactions aren’t processed in Russia must from April 1 deposit collateral related to the average daily turnover on their cards with the central bank to ensure Russian customers don’t suffer if they halt services in the country. Komlev declined to comment on whether Visa would have to pay the security deposit, and Visa refused comment on the issue. On Friday, Visa said its cards would continue to function normally until it completely moved processing of transactions made on its cards in Russia to the local system. Russia’s top lender Sberbank said transactions made on Mastercard cards it had issued would from Monday be processed by Russia’s National Payment Card System, which is owned by the central bank. Rostislav Yanykin, head of Sberbank’s bank cards department, said he did not know of any banks that had managed to transfer processing of Visa cards to the local payment system. “Visa is slightly more tricky than Mastercard,” he said. “They have an exchange protocol for cash machine operations that is much more difficult.” Komlev, the head of Russia’s payment system, also said he thought the system he heads would help residents of Crimea. Visa and Mastercard late last year stopped supporting bank cards used on the peninsula Russia annexed from Ukraine. “We see a real solution to the problem of Crimea and Sevastopol in giving the Crimean people access to the National Payment Card System,” he said. Russia’s payment system plans to start issuing its own cards towards the end of 2015.

339,V,Target nears $20 million MasterCard data breach settlement -WSJ,"April 14 (Reuters) - Target Corp is nearing a settlement with MasterCard Inc to reimburse financial institutions about $20 million for costs incurred from the retailer’s massive data breach in 2013, the Wall Street Journal reported. The deal, which comes after months of negotiations, could be announced as soon as this week, according to the Journal, citing people familiar with the terms of negotiations. The $20 million covers costs that banks incurred to reissue credit cards and debit cards as a result of the breach, as well as some of the fraud that resulted from the exposure of customer information, the newspaper said. In 2013, Target said at least 40 million credit cards were compromised by the breach during the holiday shopping season, and the attack might have resulted in the theft of personal information, such as email addresses and telephone numbers, from as many as 110 million people. MasterCard will distribute the reimbursed funds to the financial institutions that issue credit cards and debit cards under its brand, including Citigroup Inc, Capital One Financial Corp and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co, the Journal said. The Target settlement does not include financial institutions that issue under the Visa Inc brand. Target is negotiating separately with Visa, the report said. In March, according to court documents, Target agreed to pay $10 million in a proposed settlement of a class-action lawsuit related to the data breach. “We’ve seen the same story, but we do not comment on speculation,” MasterCard said when asked about the Journal’s report. Visa were not available for comment, and a Target spokesperson said the company has not made any announcements and had no comment on the matter.

All of the 10 major S&P; 500 sectors rose, with the tech index gaining 1.09 percent, propelled by Visa and MasterCard. Visa ended 4.07 percent higher at $68.01 after hitting a record high of $69.98, while MasterCard closed up 3.91 percent after China said it would open up its market to foreign firms for clearing domestic bank card transactions. McDonald’s surged 3.13 percent after it said it was working on a plan to reverse its shrinking sales. A week ago, more than 80 percent of the S&P; 500 companies to have posted their March-quarter earnings had beaten estimates. But with 121 reports now in, that number has slipped to 71.9 percent - just above the 70 percent earnings beat rate seen over the past four quarters. Many have blamed misses on revenue on a strong dollar for making their products more expensive overseas. “We’re sorting through earnings. It’s mixed, but there’s no drastic change to the general economic recovery.” said Michael Sansoterra, portfolio manager of the RidgeWorth Large Cap Growth Fund in Atlanta. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 88.68 points, or 0.49 percent, to end at 18,038.27. The S&P; 500 gained 10.67 points, or 0.51 percent, to 2,107.96 and the Nasdaq Composite added 21.07 points, or 0.42 percent, to 5,035.17. The Nasdaq Composite is now just 13 points shy of its record high close, set in March 2000, that signaled the limit of the dot-com bubble. By October 2001, 70 percent of its value had evaporated. “I do think there are valuation concerns, and some tech companies are trading at extremely high multiples,” said Derek Hoyt, chief investment officer at Minneapolis-based KDV Wealth Management. “People need to be cautious about what they buy, but I don’t think the situation calls for a 70 percent decline.” Major tech earnings on tap for Thursday include Amazon.com , which trades at over 400 times earnings, as well as Microsoft and Google. Yum Brands ended 3.95 percent higher after the restaurant operator said late on Tuesday it was recovering from a meat scare in China and expected a strong year-end finish. After the bell, eBay was up 5 percent after it posted March-quarter earnings above estimates and said its growth was hurt by the strong dollar.

348,V,China to open bank card clearing market to foreign firms from June,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China has announced it will open up its market for clearing domestic bank card transactions, a move that should allow foreign players such as Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) direct access to a market valued at $6.84 trillion last year.  Foreign firms will be able to set up their own clearing companies in China and apply to the central bank for licenses for bank card clearing businesses from June 1, the State Council said on its website on Wednesday. The measure is set to end a near monopoly held by domestic champion China UnionPay Co Ltd, and allow Visa and MasterCard, the world’s two largest credit and debit card suppliers, to challenge the state behemoth. Bank card consumer transactions for both credit and debt stood at 42.38 trillion yuan ($6.84 trillion) last year, China’s central bank said, representing annual growth of 33 percent. The move is also set to resolve a longstanding trade dispute between China and the United States. In 2012, the World Trade Organization ruled that China’s policies on electronic payment providers discriminated against foreign card companies. “Opening up the market for bank card clearing will help improve the country’s card-clearing services through market competition,” the People’s Bank of China said in an online statement on Wednesday. “(The State Council announcement) fully represents the principles of opening up the Chinese financial system and achieving a fair and competitive market environment.” China had indicated in October that it would free up its credit card market to foreign players.     A China UnionPay spokesman said the company “supports and will firmly execute” the government’s decision. A senior credit card executive welcomed the “positive development”, but said further details and clarification were needed from China’s central bank and banking regulator.    “End to end, we could be in the market within 12 months,” he added. Visa and MasterCard now piggyback their services on China UnionPay’s network when accepting yuan payments and have to pay network access fees. Foreign players who provide only bank card clearing services in foreign currencies for cross-border trade are not required to set up a bank card clearing operation inside China in principle, the statement said. The central bank and banking regulator, China Banking Regulatory Commission, will issue detailed rules. “We are hopeful these new regulations will permit additional participants in the Chinese domestic market,” Visa said in a  statement. “Visa will review the new regulations and look forward to further implementation details.” Mastercard did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

350,V,MasterCard seen stealing a march on Visa as China opens doors,"(Reuters) - MasterCard Inc’s (MA.N) strong association with Chinese bank card behemoth UnionPay is expected to help it reap more benefits than larger rival Visa Inc (V.N) as the country opens up its $7 trillion bank card payments market to foreign players. The world’s largest debit and credit card issuers have so far been barred from operating independently in the China bank card market - projected to become the world’s biggest by 2020. But that is set to change. China’s State Council said last week foreign firms would be allowed to apply to the central bank for licenses for bank card clearing businesses from June 1. The measure is set to end a near-monopoly held by UnionPay. It will take at least a year for foreign card issuers to start operations in China, but investor expectations are high. Shares of MasterCard and Visa rose 4 percent in the three days following the announcement. “It’s pretty close ... but MasterCard has a little more leeway than Visa because of its existing relationship with China UnionPay,” Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria told Reuters. The U.S. companies currently use UnionPay’s network when accepting yuan payments and have to pay network access fees. MasterCard and UnionPay signed an agreement in 2010 to issue co-branded cards that Chinese people could use when traveling overseas. The agreement gives MasterCard a strong headstart, as the company has cornered a large chunk of the co-branded cards market in the past few years. (reut.rs/1HzMxVQ) Chief Executive Ajay Banga said last year that more than 90 percent of new co-branded card deals issued in China went to MasterCard. Barclays analyst Darrin Peller estimated that a 1 percent shift in purchase volume from UnionPay would boost MasterCard’s earnings per share by 3-6 cents, compared with 2-4 cents for Visa. “Given that MasterCard is starting off at a smaller base, incremental growth in China may be more impactful to MasterCard’s economics than Visa’s over the next few years,” Peller said. The opportunities for both MasterCard and Visa are immense. UnionPay’s transaction volumes rose the most last year, according to the Nilson Report, an industry publication. Of every $100 worth of transactions swiped, UnionPay’s cards accounted for $38, ahead of Visa’s $37 and MasterCard’s $18.

U.S. gross domestic product grew just 0.2 percent at an annual rate in the quarter as harsh weather put off shoppers and energy companies cut spending. The reading was the weakest in a year and lower than the 1.0 percent rate forecast by economists polled by Reuters. Investors will closely examine the Fed’s statement for clues on when rates are likely to be increased, as a batch of soft data could push back the timing of a hike until the end of the year. The statement is expected at 1400 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT). “I think the GDP data has to be taken with a grain of salt,” said Chris Bertelsen, chief investment officer at Global Financial Private Capital in Sarasota, Florida, which oversees $4.5 billion in funds. “We saw this movie last year where the first quarter was weak but followed up with a stronger second and third quarters and you’re going to see the same pattern this year too.” In contrast to the weak GDP numbers, other data showed that contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes rose in March to their highest level since 2013. At 11:39 a.m. EDT (1539 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 76.64 points, or 0.42 percent, at 18,033.5, the S&P; 500 was down 9.49 points, or 0.45 percent, at 2,105.27 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 27.47 points, or 0.54 percent, at 5,027.95. Earnings released on Wednesday painted a mixed picture. “Corporate America is very, very busy trying to create earnings that justify the current pricing of the market,” said Dave Heidel, regional investment manager at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, which oversees $128 billion. Heidel said the consequence of companies cutting costs to boost earnings reflects in the poor GDP numbers, which were partly due to low corporate spending. Twitter dived 5.5 percent to $39.90, a day after the company cut its full-year forecast due to weak demand for its new direct response advertising. MasterCard rose 2.6 percent to $92.63 after reporting a better-than-expected profit. The results also pushed up Visa  1.7 percent to $67.95, making it the biggest gainer among stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Lumber Liquidators slumped as much as 21 percent to a three-year low of $26.54 after the hardwood flooring retailer said the Department of Justice is seeking criminal charges related to its imports from China. Starwood Hotels rose 8.7 percent to touch a record high of $87.80 after it said it was exploring strategic and financial alternatives.

353,V,Visa forecasts current-quarter profit below Street,"(Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N), the world’s largest credit and debit card company, forecast profit below Wall Street expectations for the current quarter, hurt by continued pressure from lower crude prices and a strong dollar. The company forecast third-quarter earnings per share 6-8 cents lower than analysts’ expectations. Analysts on average are expecting the company to earn 65 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Visa earns international transaction revenues through cross-border transactions and currency conversion, making it sensitive to foreign-exchange fluctuations.  The dollar .DXY has gained about 22 percent in the past 12 months against a basket of major currencies. “We expect dollar strengthening and its associated impacts to continue for the balance of the year,” Chief Financial Officer Vasant Prabhu said on an earnings call. Lower oil prices also hurt the company, as customers get more gasoline for the buck, leading to a fall in the value of transactions.  Gas bills account for about 7-8 percent of Visa’s U.S. transaction volume, according to analysts. The company, which expects to return to double-digit revenue growth in the fourth quarter, said higher client incentives will also weigh on third-quarter results. Shares of the company, a Dow Jones Industrial Average component, fell about 2 percent in extended trading. The company’s net income fell slightly to $1.55 billion for the second quarter ended March 31 from $1.60 billion a year earlier. On a per Class A share basis, earnings were flat at 63 cents. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 62 cents per share on revenue of $3.34 billion.     Visa’s cross-border volume growth, where the issuing country is different from the merchant country, was flat at 8 percent on a constant-dollar basis during the quarter. The company’s operating revenue rose 7.8 percent to $3.41 billion. International transaction revenue grew about 10 percent and accounted for about 28 percent of total revenue. Speaking about China allowing foreign companies to clear domestic bank card transactions, Chief Executive Charlie Scharf said on a call, “We are not pursuing this for the short-term profit opportunity. This will pay off over the long term.”	 Visa and smaller rival MasterCard Inc (MA.N) stand to benefit from China’s decision.  Warehouse club Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) has chosen Visa to run its co-branded credit card starting next year, replacing American Express Co (AXP.N).

Visa’s cross-border volume growth, where the issuing country is different from the merchant country, was flat at 8 percent on a constant-dollar basis during the quarter. The company’s operating revenue rose 7.8 percent to $3.41 billion. International transaction revenue grew about 10 percent and accounted for about 28 percent of total revenue. Speaking about China allowing foreign companies to clear domestic bank card transactions, Chief Executive Charlie Scharf said on a call, “We are not pursuing this for the short-term profit opportunity. This will pay off over the long term.” Visa and smaller rival MasterCard Inc stand to benefit from China’s decision.

362,V,Visa threatens to ditch FIFA as sponsor dismay mounts,"NEW YORK/BERLIN (Reuters) - Visa Inc has told FIFA it could end its sponsorship if soccer’s governing body does not act fast to restore the reputation of the game after senior officials were arrested on  corruption charges. The statement from Visa was the strongest so far as sponsors lined up to express concern about the scandal engulfing the world’s most popular sport and their customers took to social media to threaten a boycott of brands associated with FIFA. Sponsors are trying to balance the growing sensitivity of consumers to corruption, human rights abuses and environmental issues against their relationship with the organization that holds the keys to a billion soccer fans worldwide. “Our disappointment and concern with FIFA in light of today’s developments is profound. As a sponsor, we expect FIFA to take swift and immediate steps to address these issues within its organization,” Visa said.     “This starts with rebuilding a culture with strong ethical practices,” it said. “Should FIFA fail to do so, we have informed them that we will reassess our sponsorship.” U.S. prosecutors issued an indictment on Wednesday accusing nine officials from soccer’s world governing body and five sports media and promotions executives of bribes involving more than $150 million over 24 years. Airline Emirates [EMIRA.UL] and Japanese electronics maker Sony Corp announced in November they would not renew deals with FIFA, although rivals Qatar Airways and Samsung are reportedly in talks to replace them. Emirates and Sony were among FIFA’s six main partners who together paid a total of $177 million in 2014 for the right to advertise in World Cup stadiums and use the FIFA trademark. A source familiar with the Sony decision said suspected corruption was one factor behind Sony’s withdrawal although the main reason was the high cost of the sponsorship deal. Sponsors have long faced risks to their brands from sports scandals ranging from doping to match fixing to misbehavior of top players on and off the pitch. Sponsors including Nike Inc dropped American cyclist Lance Armstrong in 2012 after he was banned for doping, but Germany’s Adidas decided last year to stick with Uruguay’s Luis Suarez after FIFA banned him for nine matches for biting an Italy defender. “Brands have to take a longer-term view. Any sport is littered with controversy on and off the field,” said Paul Smith, founder of sports marketing research group Repucom.  “What fans care about most of all is the game itself rather than the business of the game... Being a sponsor of FIFA implies you are a sponsor of the game, not of the organization.” FIFA’s longest standing partners are Adidas and Coca-Cola Co. Adidas has been the provider of the World Cup match ball since 1970 and has a partnership lasting until 2030, while the current deal for Coca-Cola, which has had a formal association since 1974 and has advertised in every World Cup stadium since 1950, lasts until 2022. That perhaps explains why they stopped short of threatening to cut ties like Visa, the world’s largest credit and debit card company, which only became a FIFA partner in 2007 and recently extended the relationship until 2022.  “This lengthy controversy has tarnished the mission and ideals of the FIFA World Cup and we have repeatedly expressed our concerns about these serious allegations,” Coca Cola said. Adidas, which is the world’s biggest manufacturer of soccer balls, boots and shirts, side stepped outright criticism, calling instead for FIFA “to continue to establish and follow transparent compliance standards”. Its shares fell 1.5 percent on Thursday. Meanwhile, Nike, which is not a FIFA partner but is challenging Adidas’ dominance in soccer by sponsoring many of the world’s top players and teams, said it was cooperating with authorities after it was indirectly identified in the U.S. indictment in relation to a 1996 deal with the Brazil team. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch declined to comment on whether there was any liability for companies that had won marketing rights and if they were being investigated. But she said “the investigation is continuing and covers all aspects.” She declined to comment when asked if one of the companies was Nike. Nike later said in a statement it was “concerned by the very serious allegations, adding: “Nike believes in ethical and fair play in both business and sport and strongly opposes any form of manipulation or bribery.” FIFA’s main sponsors were already getting uneasy even before the latest revelations.  Adidas, Visa and Coca-Cola all made statements last week pushing FIFA to take seriously the issue of rights for migrant workers in Qatar, responding to reports of abuses at the 2022 World Cup construction sites. That came after campaigners designed spoof ads for major FIFA sponsors subverting their brand images, including a Coca-Cola can dripping with oil and the iconic three stripes of Adidas tweaked to look like a line of gravestones. The pressure only mounted after Wednesday’s news, with social media full of appeals for brands to cut ties with FIFA.  “Adidas, Visa, Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Budweiser, Hyundai: stop supporting corrupt FIFA or I stop buying your brands,” wrote Stefan-Joerg Goebel on Twitter.  The Institute of Directors (IoD), a leading UK authority on corporate governance, said risks were mounting for sponsors. “They have a responsibility to their shareholders to make certain that the company’s cash is not going towards sporting events mired in bribery and corruption allegations,” said Roger Barker, IoD director of corporate governance. South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor, the sole Asian FIFA partner for the 2018 World Cup due to be held in Russia, said it was “extremely concerned” about the legal proceedings, while Bud-owner Anheuser-Busch InBev and McDonald’s Corp said they were in contact with FIFA. Australian sportswear company SKINS, which announced in a tongue-in-cheek campaign in January that it was the first “official” FIFA non-sponsor, urged the brands to clean up FIFA. “The only people FIFA will listen to are the sponsors. The real money is with the broadcasters but their brands aren’t exposed in the same way as the sponsors,” said SKINS chairman Jaimie Fuller. But brand experts were skeptical of a mass exodus of FIFA sponsors. “Football is one of the few global properties that enables you to connect with people around the world,” said Interbrand Chief Executive Jez Frampton.  Rob Prazmark, president of 21 Sports & Entertainment Marketing Group, a global sports and event sales agency agreed: “These sponsors put a lot of money into associating with the World Cup,” he said. “They’ll give them a little bit of time to get their house in order.” ",5282015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-soccer-fifa-sponsors/visa-threatens-to-ditch-fifa-as-sponsor-dismay-mounts-idUSKBN0OC2UH20150528

367,V,American Express loses emergency bid to block U.S. card injunction,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Tuesday rejected American Express Co’s emergency request to halt an injunction that requires the company to let merchants steer customers toward lower-cost cards offered by competitors. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York nonetheless said it will hear American Express’ appeal in the underlying antitrust case on an expedited basis. American Express is appealing a Feb. 19 decision by U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn, New York that its rules preventing merchants who accept its cards from recommending that customers pay with other cards, such as MasterCard and Visa, violate antitrust laws. The judge’s April 30 injunction against enforcing these rules also lets merchants offer discounts, rebates and other incentives to customers for using other cards with lower fees. Garaufis has said American Express’ practices wrongfully exploited the New York-based company’s 26.4 percent share of purchase volume in the U.S. credit and charge card market. “We are disappointed the request for a stay was denied,” American Express said in a statement on Tuesday. “We will move forward to modify the non-discrimination provisions in our merchant contracts, per the trial court’s remedy.” American Express has argued that enforcing the injunction would “weaken competition and harm consumers” in the $2.4 trillion U.S. credit card industry, and cause irreparable harm by costing it revenue and market share. It has said the February decision, if upheld, would help entrench Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc, which together have more than 1.1 billion cards in the United States versus American Express’ roughly 55 million. American Express said its card holders spend three to four times more, on average. Garaufis ruled in a lawsuit filed in 2010 by the U.S. government and 17 states. Visa and MasterCard were also sued by various governments over their anti-steering rules for merchants but settled in 2011 by agreeing to make changes. Card companies charge merchants more than $50 billion a year to process consumer transactions, the U.S. government has said. The case is U.S. et al v.

Garaufis has said American Express’ practices wrongfully exploited the New York-based company’s 26.4 percent share of purchase volume in the U.S. credit and charge card market. “We are disappointed the request for a stay was denied,” American Express said in a statement on Tuesday. “We will move forward to modify the non-discrimination provisions in our merchant contracts, per the trial court’s remedy.” American Express has argued that enforcing the injunction would “weaken competition and harm consumers” in the $2.4 trillion U.S. credit card industry, and cause irreparable harm by costing it revenue and market share. It has said the February decision, if upheld, would help entrench Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc, which together have more than 1.1 billion cards in the United States versus American Express’ roughly 55 million. American Express said its card holders spend three to four times more, on average. Garaufis ruled in a lawsuit filed in 2010 by the U.S. government and 17 states. Visa and MasterCard were also sued by various governments over their anti-steering rules for merchants but settled in 2011 by agreeing to make changes. Card companies charge merchants more than $50 billion a year to process consumer transactions, the U.S. government has said. The case is U.S. et al v. American Express Co et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-1672.

369,V,MasterCard stops allowing charges for Backpage.com sex ads,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - MasterCard said on Tuesday that its credit cards can no longer be used to pay for ads on the Backpage.com website, following a request from a Chicago law enforcement official who said the site is used by sex traffickers. Cook County Sheriff Thomas Dart said that so-called “escort” ads on Backpage.com and similar sites make up the foundation of the sex trafficking industry, which preys on the young and vulnerable. He has asked both Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc to cut off any association with the Backpage.com “adult” section. “Backpage has significantly lowered the barrier to entry for would-be traffickers,” said Dart, adding he will reveal details of a larger initiative against Backpage at a news conference on Wednesday. MasterCard spokesman Seth Eisen said in an email that the company has rules that prohibit its cards from being used for illegal or brand-damaging activities. Backpage is a classified advertising website that offers forums to find roommates and sell goods, like other sites, but its primary revenue stream is through its adult page, according to Dart’s office. An attorney for Backpage.com was not immediately available for comment. Cook County Sheriff’s police have made more than 800 arrests since 2009 stemming from Backpage ads, including an arrest for juvenile sex trafficking just last month, according to Dart’s office. American Express Co has already stopped allowing its credit cards to be used for “adult” ads on Backpage.com, company  spokeswoman Sanette Chao said. “We can terminate card acceptance for any merchant that we deem harmful to our brand, illegal or high risk,” Chao said.

374,V,UPDATE 2-PayPal returns to market with $52 bln valuation,"(Adds details, industry background) By Devika  Krishna Kumar and Mari Saito July 20 (Reuters) - PayPal Holdings Inc shares jumped as much as 11 percent in their highly anticipated return to the Nasdaq after more than a decade in eBay Inc’s  fold, valuing the digital payment processor at about $52 billion. PayPal is a giant in the market it helped create - it processed 4 billion payments totaling about $235 billion in 2014. But the online payments landscape has changed drastically since the company was snapped up by eBay in 2002. Freed from eBay, PayPal is now expected to partner with other e-commerce sites and try to seize market share from startups such as Stripe and Square and Apple Inc, which unveiled its own mobile payments service last year. For eBay, the separation allows the company to focus on its struggling e-commerce marketplace. PayPal shares soared to $42.55 in early trading. EBay’s stock fell as much as 4.7 percent, valuing the company at about $32 billion. “PayPal is the gorilla among independent digital payment service providers with more than 160 million active accounts, global scale and brand recognition,” J.P. Morgan analysts said. PayPal is also looking to compete with Western Union Co  and other money transfer companies. CEO Dan Shulman said he was looking to use PayPal’s size to offer affordable financial services widely. “It’s clear that the potential for mobile technology to transform money extends beyond commerce. The vast majority of the world’s 7 billion people lack access to even basic financial services,” Schulman told Reuters. PayPal was founded in the late 1990s by venture capitalist Peter Thiel, Tesla Motors Inc CEO Elon Musk and others. It went public in 2002 and was acquired by eBay soon after for $1.5 billion. Bowing to pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn, eBay said last year it would split PayPal as this would give both companies more focus and flexibility. The companies, however, are not severing ties altogether -eBay has agreed it won’t cut the volume of transactions it channels through PayPal for the next five years. Wall Street analysts were overwhelmingly bullish on the stock. Nine of the 11 starting coverage on the stock have a “buy” or similar rating. Only Evercore has a “sell”. Price targets range from $36 to $48. BMO capital Markets analysts said they expected investors to value PayPal relative to Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc , but added that PayPal had a relatively low EBITDA margin profile of 27 percent - around half that of the credit card giants. PayPal also faces a fight in the rapidly evolving mobile payments market. “The competitive advantages PayPal enjoyed in the traditional online commerce channel do not necessarily carry over into the mobile and offline worlds, in our view,” J.P. Morgan analysts said. PayPal recently acquired Xoom, putting it in a position to  take on Western Union and MoneyGram’s online businesses.

375,V,PayPal valued at about $50 bln ahead of market debut,"July 20 (Reuters) - PayPal Holdings Inc shares rose 5.9 percent in premarket trading, ahead of their highly anticipated return to the Nasdaq, valuing the company at about $50 billion. PayPal, spun off from eBay Inc, is widely expected to build partnerships with e-commerce rivals and try to seize market share from startups such as Stripe and Square and technology behemoth Apple Inc, which unveiled its own mobile payments service last year. PayPal shares traded at $40.62, up from Friday’s close of $38.35 when the shares were trading on a “when issued” basis. “PayPal is the gorilla among independent digital payment service providers with more than 160 million active accounts, global scale and brand recognition,” J.P.

EBay has split PayPal back off again, saying this would give both companies more focus and flexibility. Based on eBay common stock outstanding as of June 1, about 1.22 billion shares of PayPal common stock would have been distributed to eBay shareholders. “We believe PayPal represents the most direct way to play growth in online and mobile payments, which we expect will grow several hundred basis points faster than the industry as online takes share,” BMO capital Markets analysts said. They said they expected investors to value PayPal relative to Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc, but added that PayPal had a relatively low EBITDA margin profile - 27 percent versus 60-70 percent for the two credit card giants. Analysts added that PayPal faced a fight in the rapidly evolving mobile payments market. “... user engagement is changing, and the competitive advantages PayPal enjoyed in the traditional online commerce channel do not necessarily carry over into the mobile and offline worlds, in our view,” JP Morgan analysts said. Last week, eBay said it would sell its enterprise business to a consortium led by private equity firm Permira, a deal that leaves eBay with its marketplace business, where it faces stiff competition from rivals such as Amazon.com Inc.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell back into the red for the year, with 3M, American Express and Caterpillar contributing the most to the average’s fall. The Dow Jones transportation average was off 2.1 percent, with only one of its 20 components ending in the black. Union Pacific, down 5.7 percent at $92.12 after posting a lower quarterly profit, led the decline in transportation shares and was among the S&P; 500’s biggest drags. “The initial take on big earnings reports has been lukewarm at best,” said Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategist at Bolton Global Asset Management in Boston. “The strong dollar certainly has been mentioned a lot, and I think there are still questions about demand in the economy and what would translate into revenue growth for most reporting companies.” Caterpillar shares fell 3.6 percent to $76.88 and touched a four-year low. The world’s largest construction and mining equipment maker reported sales declines in key markets in a sluggish global economy. American Express was down 2.5 percent at $77.01 after its revenue missed expectations, while diversified manufacturer 3M  was down 3.8 percent at $149.50 after cutting its full-year forecast. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 119.09 points, or 0.67 percent, to 17,731.95, the S&P; 500 lost 12 points, or 0.57 percent, to 2,102.15 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 25.36 points, or 0.49 percent, to 5,146.41. After the bell, however, Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures  turned positive following results from Amazon, whose shares jumped 18 percent in extended trading. Also jumping after the close, Visa shares were up 7 percent following results. During the regular session, all of the 10 major S&P; 500 sectors were lower with the utilities index leading the decline with a 1.5 percent fall along with the materials index, also down 1.5 percent. Dow Chemical’s 5.2 percent drop to $47.45 weighed the most on the sector. Dow Chemical warned of soft demand in China after posting stronger-than-expected results. Second-quarter S&P; 500 earnings have been mixed, with 75 percent of companies so far beating analysts’ profit expectations and just 52 percent surpassing revenue expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data.

The two stocks, together with American Express,  contributed 68 points to the Dow’s fall. Caterpillar shares fell as much as 3.8 percent to a four-year low of $76.75 after the world’s largest construction and mining equipment maker reported sales decline in key markets in a sluggish global economy. American Express fell 3.2 percent to $76.40 as revenue missed expectations while 3M was down 3.4 percent at $150.09 after the diversified manufacturer cut its full-year forecasts. “Companies such as Caterpillar are a litmus test for the global economy especially at a time when the market is concerned about China’s economy,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. Luschini said strong results from General Motors was helping offset some of the losses by Caterpillar and 3M. General Motors jumped 4.3 percent to $31.60 after its adjusted net income more than doubled in the second quarter. At 12:43 p.m. ET (1643 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was down 92.8 points, or 0.52 percent, at 17,758.24, the S&P; 500 was down 9.59 points, or 0.45 percent, at 2,104.56 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 12.91 points, or 0.25 percent, at 5,158.87. Nine of the 10 major S&P; 500 sectors were lower with the utilities index leading the decliners with a 1.8 percent fall. The materials index fell 1.2 percent with Dow Chemical’s 3.5 percent drop weighing the most on the sector. Corporate earnings will continue to drive the market with a host of big companies scheduled to report on Thursday. Dow component Visa, Amazon and AT&T; are expected after the close. While markets remain near record highs, June-quarter S&P; 500 earnings are expected to dip 1 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data, less than the 3-percent decline expected at the start of July. Of the companies that have reported so far, 75 percent beat earnings expectations, above the 63-percent average beat rate since 1994. However, only 52 percent have topped revenue forecasts, below the 61-percent average beat rate since 2002. “For the markets to move higher we need to see revenue growth and consumer spending to pick up. There is a feeling that consumers aren’t spending enough and are saving instead,” said Kevin Dorwin, managing principal of Bingham, Osborn & Scarborough in San Francisco, which oversees $3.4 billion. The U.S. market is a little bit overvalued at the moment and is due for a correction, he said. The S&P; 500 is currently trading at 16.9 times forward 12 months earnings, above the 10-year median of 14.7 times, according to StarMine data. SanDisk jumped 16.2 percent to $62.94, a day after the data storage products maker reported a quarterly profit that was double of what analysts had expected.

384,V,CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-Cost cutting eases strong-dollar pain for American Express,"(Corrects to “Visa Inc” from “MasterCard Inc” in paragraph 14) * 2nd-qtr earnings $1.42/shr vs est $1.32/shr * Costs fall 4 pct; salaries, benefit costs down 25 pct By Richa Naidu and Sudarshan Varadhan July 22 (Reuters) - Credit card issuer American Express Co  reported a better-than-expected second-quarter profit as it benefited from cost-savings after cutting jobs. Stiff competition, a strong U.S. dollar and sluggish revenue growth in recent years prompted AmEx to announce in January that it would axe over 4,000 jobs this year. Salaries and employee benefits, AmEx’s second-biggest expense, fell 25 percent to $1.25 billion in the three months ended June 30, pulling total costs down by 4 percent to $5.6 billion. This helped AmEx report earnings of $1.42 per share instead of $1.32 per share as analysts had estimated, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. AmEx’s net income attributable to common shareholders fell 5 percent to $1.44 billion as a stronger dollar cut into revenue from markets outside the United States. These markets account for about a sixth of the company’s revenue. The dollar has gained about 21 percent against a basket of major currencies in the past 12 months. Shares of AmEx were down 2 percent at $77.40 in after-market trading. “(AmEx did) better than our expectations on earnings, but people might focus on revenue being slightly weaker, though a lot of that is driven by FX,” FBR & Co analyst Sanjay Sakhrani said. Total revenue, net of interest expense, fell 4 percent to $8.28 billion, dragged by a 9.6 percent decline in revenue from card services from markets outside the United States. Revenue from the U.S. Card Services business rose 6 percent to $4.7 billion, net of interest expense. Costs at this business rose 4 percent to $3 billion, partly driven by expenses from previously renewed co-brand partnerships, AmEx said. There is stiff competition in the industry to bag prominent “co-brand” deals, in which card issuers team up with prominent corporate partners - often supermarkets or airlines - to sell cards. AmEx, whose image relies on catering mainly to wealthy corporate clients, lost a couple of lucrative co-brand contracts this year because it charges higher prices than rivals. The company’s exclusive tie-up with Costco in the United States will be given over to Citigroup and Visa Inc  in March. The deal accounted for 8 percent of spending on AmEx cards in 2014. AmEx said in February that the loss of the U.S. Costco contract would hurt earnings for the next two years. The company also ended a deal with JetBlue Airways. The contract was picked up by Barclays Plc and MasterCard.

386,V,"Wall Street slides to end rough week on macro, earnings concerns","(Reuters) - The S&P; 500 and Nasdaq posted their largest weekly drops since March on Friday as slowing global growth dragged commodity-related stocks lower while an earnings-fueled drop in Biogen took down the biotech sector. Biogen (BIIB.O) more than halved its revenue growth forecast for 2015 and its stock lost 22 percent to close just above $300.  Stocks in the energy and materials sectors weighed heavily on the market after weaker-than-expected economic data from China and the euro zone raised concerns about global growth. Oil prices hit their lowest since March. “You got underwhelming revenue growth on balance and then you layer on top of that concern over a global economic slowdown, that becomes self-fulfilling,” Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York, said of the stock market weakness. Amazon (AMZN.O) was the bright spot on Friday, rising more than 20 percent at one point and closing up 10 percent at $530.50. The online retailer posted an unexpected quarterly profit and its market cap ballooned to $247 billion, making it the tenth-largest U.S. company by market value. However, Amazon’s spike highlighted the thinning of leadership in the S&P; 500. Gains on the index so far this year can be attributed to Amazon and just three more companies. At the close of trading on Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 163.39 points, or 0.92 percent, to 17,568.53, the S&P; 500 .SPX lost 22.5 points, or 1.07 percent, to 2,079.65 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 57.78 points, or 1.12 percent, to 5,088.63. For the week, the S&P; fell 2.2 percent and the Nasdaq slid 2.3 percent in their largest weekly drops since the last week of March. The 2.9 percent fall on the Dow was the largest for any week since January.  Selling in stocks accelerated after a report from the Wall Street Journal said Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will propose nearly doubling the U.S. capital gains tax rate on short-term investments. Second-quarter S&P; 500 earnings have been mixed, with 74 percent of companies beating analysts’ profit expectations but just 52 percent surpassing revenue expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data. Adding to the concerns regarding lukewarm earnings, the S&P; 500 is relatively expensive, trading at 16.9 times forward 12 months’ earnings, above the 10-year median of 14.7 times, according to StarMine data. Dow component Visa (V.N) ended up 4.3 percent at $74.80 after the credit and debit card company’s results handily beat expectations. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,246 to 831, for a 2.70-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 2,144 issues fell and 660 advanced for a 3.25-to-1 ratio favoring decliners. The benchmark S&P; 500 index posted 13 new 52-week highs and 54 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 50 new highs and 200 new lows.

To receive The Day Ahead, Eikon users can register at . Thomson One users can register at RT/DAY/US. All times in ET/GMT)  WEEK AHEAD Markets next week will be dominated by earnings, as big oil, healthcare and several notable social media names lead the pack in what has so far been a middling earnings season, save for some giants that have far exceeded expectations. Facebook, Exxon Mobil and Pfizer are all on the docket. The market will also gravitate to the Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting, the last before September, which still looms as the first possibility for an interest-rate increase from the Fed. Facebook Inc is expected to grow revenue, excluding the impact of a strong dollar, according to Wall Street analysts. Analysts expect the company’s ongoing traction with various segments of advertisers to help Facebook capturing a growing share of digital advertising budgets. When it posts its second-quarter results on Wednesday, investors will keep a close watch on costs and whether the company can keep up growth in monthly active users. Twitter Inc, which has been struggling with slowing user growth, is expected to report second-quarter revenue on Tuesday, below analysts’ expectations, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. Investors will look for commentary on the progress in the direct response ads. They will also be on the lookout for updates on the ongoing CEO search and the impact of a strong dollar. On Thursday, professional social network LinkedIn Corp is expected to report second-quarter revenue slightly above average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. Investors will keep a close watch on the company’s hiring business, in which revenue growth slowed to 36 percent in the first quarter. Exxon Mobil Corp, the world’s biggest listed oil company, and its U.S. peer, Chevron Corp, are scheduled to post second-quarter earnings on Friday. The world’s top oil companies are set to report yet another sharp drop in quarterly profits that could force more spending cuts due to a dim outlook for oil prices. Procter & Gamble Co and Colgate-Palmolive Co, the two U.S. personal care products companies with big operations outside the United States, have been working to reduce the impact of a stronger dollar on sales. While Colgate has raised prices in emerging markets, P&G; is setting up manufacturing plants there to localize supply chain activities. When Colgate reports its second-quarter results and P&G; its fourth quarter on Thursday, they are expected to beat analysts’ estimates on revenue, but miss on profit, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. Investors will be keen on any forecast updates and changes in strategy. Thursday’s data will show the U.S. economy is likely to have expanded at a much faster pace in the second quarter. The gross domestic product is projected to have risen at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the April-June quarter, compared to a contraction of 0.2 percent annual rate in the January-March quarter. Separately, the Labor Department issues Employment Cost Index on Friday. On the same day, the University of Michigan’s final July reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment is expected to come in at 94.0, a bit higher from a preliminary reading of 93.3. On Tuesday, financial firm Markit will release its preliminary reading of Purchasing Managers Index for the services sector, which is expected to increase to 55.0 from 54.8 in June. Pending Home Sales Index on Wednesday forecast to have risen 1.0 percent, compared to June’s 0.9 percent increase. Mastercard Inc is scheduled to post second-quarter results on Wednesday. A strong dollar is expected to hurt the world’s No.2 debit and credit card company, which gets 60 percent of its payment volumes from outside the United States. About 10 percent of transactions made using the company’s plastic are on gasoline, according to analysts, and the low oil prices remain a drag on Mastercard’s earnings. Arch rival Visa is in talks to buy Visa Europe, which could mean a more powerful threat in Europe, where Mastercard has a strong presence. The company is expected to report second-quarter earnings in line with analysts’ expectations, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. On Tuesday, Merck & Co, the No. 2 U.S. drugmaker, is expected to report lower sales for the second quarter, hurt by the stronger dollar and divestiture of its consumer care business. On the same day, Pfizer Inc, which captures 60 percent of its revenue from abroad, is expected to report lower second-quarter earnings as the stronger dollar hurts sales outside the United States. Amgen Inc is expected to report higher second-quarter sales and profit and may revise its full-year forecasts on Thursday. Investors will be looking for details on the company’s plans for the launch of its just approved injectable cholesterol treatment in Europe, as well as its expectations for likely U.S. approval and launch in the coming weeks. Biotechnology company Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc is expected to report lower-than-expected second-quarter earnings, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. Vertex was the first to develop a drug to treat the underlying cause of a rare lung scarring disorder called cystic fibrosis (CF). On Wednesday, investors will be looking to see how well the company is faring following the approval of Vertex’s latest CF drug, which allows the drugmaker to address a population of 8,500 patients, up from 2,000. Anthem Inc, which agreed to buy smaller rival Cigna recently, announces second-quarter earnings on Wednesday. It is expected to report a higher profit, but all ears will be on any signs that medical costs are a problem and any further commentary on its $54-billion deal for Cigna. Cigna Corp reports a second-quarter profit on Thursday that is expected to be higher. On Wednesday, Humana Inc, which has recently agreed to be bought by Aetna, posts its second-quarter earnings. The company warned of its weaker outlook for 2015 already due to higher medical costs in Medicare Advantage customers, and analysts have lowered their expectations for the quarter. On Tuesday, health insurer Centene Corp is likely to report a better-than-expected second-quarter profit, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. On Tuesday, chemicals company DuPont Co is expected to report a lower second-quarter profit, hurt by a fall in agriculture earnings and a stronger dollar. DuPont derives about 60 percent of its sales from outside North America. The company in May defeated a campaign by Trian to land seats on DuPont’s board, delivering a landmark setback to one of the most influential activist investor firms. The company has moved its focus to its agri business, but seed sales have been weighed down by a switch to soybean from corn in North America. Corn seed sales account for about half of the sales from the agricultural products unit, the company’s largest. Ford Motor Co is scheduled to post second-quarter earnings on Tuesday. Recently, Ford had announced that it is looking to a raft of new sedan and SUV launches in China later this year to regain momentum in the world’s largest auto market, after its sales barely grew in the first half of 2015. Canadian plane and train manufacturer Bombardier Inc reports its financial results for the second quarter on Thursday. Analysts and investors may be looking for news on the Global 7000/8000, its newest business jets, which are scheduled to go into service in 2016 and 2017 respectively. Separately, Textron Inc, the maker of Beechcraft and Cessna aircraft, announces second-quarter results on Tuesday. The company is expected to benefit from burgeoning international demand, especially in its commercial market. Video game publisher Electronic Arts Inc reports first-quarter results on Thursday.  The company is expected to report a quarterly profit above estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. EA is expected to benefit from its fast-growing digital business, which includes software distributed through the Internet. Investors, analysts and gamers alike will be looking any details on the company’s biggest release of the year, “Star Wars Battlefront”, which comes out in mid-November before the new “Star Wars” movie. Satellite-TV provider DirecTV is expected to report second-quarter earnings slightly below analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. When it reports on Thursday, all eyes will be on AT&T;’s $48.5 billion merger with DirecTV that is expected to close soon as U.S. telecom and antitrust regulators signaled a green light for the merger. On Thursday, wireless chip maker Broadcom Corp is expected to report better-than-expected second-quarter profit and revenue, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. The company has been benefiting from strong demand for Apple’s iPhone 6 and Samsung Electronics’ Galaxy S6. Investors will look for details on whether the company’s exit from the baseband chips business is creating competitive disadvantage due to the lack of a 4G product. On Thursday, cable provider Time Warner Cable Inc, which is being bought by Charter Communications, is expected to report second-quarter revenue slightly below the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. Last quarter, the company added 30,000 residential video customers, its first increase since 2009 and well above analysts’ average estimate, indicating a turnaround for the company. Analysts are looking for any update on the deal, future investments and guidance. On Thursday, T-Mobile US Inc, the No. 4 U.S. wireless carrier, is expected to report second-quarter revenue ahead of analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, helped by customer wins that are drawn to its low-cost plans. The company’s profit, however, is expected to take a hit, hurt by costs related to aggressive marketing campaign. On Tuesday, specialty glass maker Corning Inc is expected to report second-quarter revenue below analysts’ expectations, according to StarMine data. Analysts expect display glass demand to be hurt by weak sales of personal computers and lower TV sales due to instability in China, which accounts for a quarter of global TV demand. Investors will look to see if adoption of 4K TV and continued demand for Gorilla glass can make up for the weakness. Microsoft Corp, the world’s largest software company, releases Windows 10 on Wednesday. Windows 10 is the latest version of its venerable operating system which is fighting for relevance in a new mobile-computing world dominated by Apple and Google. U.S. pipeline company Williams Companies Inc, which is in the middle of a takeover battle with Energy Transfer Equity LP, is expected to report a higher profit for the second quarter on Wednesday. The focus with the quarter will be on Energy Transfer’s offer. Energy Transfer said this month it would take any steps necessary to acquire Williams, after the company rebuffed the offer and said it was it was exploring strategic options. Mondelez International Inc, the maker of Cadbury chocolate and Oreo cookies, is likely to report second-quarter sales below analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. The company has been grappling with volatility in markets such as Europe, where sales have fallen for the last three quarters. Investors will look for updates on the company’s discussion with Wal-Mart to “revisit” the strategy change, market conditions in Europe and progress on the sale of its French coffee brand, Carte Noir, when it reports on Thursday. D.R. Horton Inc, the largest U.S. homebuilder, is expected to report higher revenue and profit for the third quarter on Tuesday as it sold more homes at higher prices. Investors will be looking out for an update on its full-year financial forecast. The friendly pursuit by Canada’s Potash Corp of Saskatchewan Inc of German rival K+S tops the interest of investors and analysts in the fertilizer sector, and Potash CEO Jochen Tilk will be asked about his next move toward a potential $8-billion deal when the company announces its second-quarter results on Thursday. On Thursday, CME Group Inc reports second-quarter earnings, weeks after closing its open-outcry futures trading pits because of the shift of volume to computers. Sirius XM Holdings Inc announces second-quarter results on Tuesday. The company is expected to report robust customer wins for its satellite radio service through the year, helped by strong U.S. auto sales. People who buy new cars fitted with Sirius receivers usually get free access for a few months, but must pay a fee to continue the service. In April, the company raised its revenue and subscriber addition forecast for the full year. Akamai Technologies Inc, whose service helps speed up delivery of online content, is expected to report second-quarter revenue and profit marginally above estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. However, when it reports its results on Tuesday, the company’s revenue is expected to take a hit from a stronger dollar, as it rakes in about a quarter of its revenue from outside the United States. Western Digital Corp, the world’s No. 1 hard-disk drive maker, on Wednesday is expected to report fourth-quarter profit below estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, as the company has been facing slower growth in its cloud business, and lower demand from its enterprise customers. On Wednesday, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc, the owner of Waldorf Astoria and Conrad brands of hotels, is expected to report second-quarter revenue above analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. With hotel occupancy in the United States reaching record heights, analysts expect a spike in average room rates, boosting revenue. Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc is expected to post second-quarter profit and revenue below estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. Investors will be looking for updates on strategic and financial alternatives announcement made last quarter, when it reports on Thursday. On Thursday, U.S. refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp is expected to report a higher second-quarter profit, helped by strong profit margins. Gasoline crack spreads - the difference between crude oil and gasoline prices- have risen on weak crude prices and robust gasoline demand. Investors will look for details on the company’s expectations for the natural gas processing business. On the same day, Valero Energy Corp is expected to report a rise in quarterly profit, helped by robust gasoline demand and a steep fall in oil prices. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd reports second-quarter earnings on Friday. The world’s second-largest cruise operator is expected to report quarterly profit and sales below analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, hurt by higher fuel costs and a strong dollar. Increased promotional and marketing spending is likely to negatively impact margins as well. However, the company is likely to benefit from its partnership with online travel company Ctrip, which could lead to an increase revenue from the Asia-Pacific. Yelp Inc, the operator of consumer review website yelp.com, is expected to report a second-quarter profit below the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data.

Amazon.com shares jumped as much as 20.4 percent to a record of $580.57 after the online retailer posted an unexpected quarterly profit. The jump catapulted Amazon’s market value to about $270 billion, overtaking Wal-Mart. Metal prices hit multi-year lows as weaker-than-expected data from China and the euro zone raised concerns about global growth while oil prices neared four-month lows. The three major indexes were poised to end the week in the red as Biogen’s 19 percent slump weighed the most on the Nasdaq and the S&P; 500 and dragged down other health stocks. Adding to the day’s pressure, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will propose nearly doubling the U.S. capital gains tax rate on short-term investments, the Wall Street Journal reported. Second-quarter S&P; 500 earnings have been mixed, with 74 percent of companies beating analysts’ profit expectations but just 52 percent surpassing revenue expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data. RBC Capital Markets said investors were treating disappointing stocks harshly. While only 20 percent of companies have missed expectations, below the 23 percent over the past three years, there was a 3.5 percent selloff versus the 2.4 percent seen historically, a note said. Adding to the concerns regarding lukewarm earnings, the S&P; 500 is relatively expensive, trading at 16.9 times forward 12 months’ earnings, above the 10-year median of 14.7 times, according to StarMine data. “We are not going to see a lot of earnings growth in the second half of the year as the economic data hasn’t been very strong,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. “The fall in commodities is also a concern that global growth is slowing and that ties into U.S. growth too.” Data on Friday showed new U.S. single-family home sales fell in June to their lowest level in seven months and May’s sales were revised sharply lower. Other data showed manufacturing activity nudged up in July after slowing for three straight months. At 12:43 p.m. ET (1643 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was down 100.26 points, or 0.57 percent, at 17,631.66, the S&P; 500 was down 11.81 points, or 0.56 percent, at 2,090.34 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 16.61 points, or 0.32 percent, at 5,129.80. Six of the 10 major S&P; 500 indexes were lower with the materials index’s 1.79 percent fall leading the decliners. Dow component Visa was up 4.3 percent at $74.87 after the credit and debit card company’s results handsomely beat  expectations. Starbucks rose 2.4 percent to $57.96 after the world’s biggest coffee chain reported a higher quarterly profit.

391,V,"FIFA to meet sponsors after reproaches from Coke, Visa, McDonald's","ST PETERSBURG (Reuters) - FIFA will meet its leading commercial partners next month after three of them increased pressure for major reforms to soccer’s governing body following a series of corruption scandals. FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke said that Coca-Cola, Visa and McDonald’s had written asking for information about what was being done to clean up governance of the sport. He admitted that scandal had made it difficult to attract new sponsors. “Clearly, there were a number of sponsors, mainly three, its Coca-Cola, McDonald’s and Visa, who have expressed and sent a letter to FIFA, asking for information,” he told a new conference in the Russian city of St Petersburg. “Two or three days ago we received a letter from all of them offering to meet together, so there will there will be a meeting next month.” Criticism of FIFA’s governance came to a head in May when U.S. prosecutors indicted nine soccer officials, most of whom had FIFA positions, and five marketing and broadcasting company executives over a range of alleged offences. These included fraud, money-laundering and racketeering. Valcke added that FIFA has been keeping its partners informed of developments. “We sent (information) to all our commercial partners, not just those three,” he said. “We sent them an update, a summary, of all that has happened within FIFA since 2012 since the first reform process started, (of) what has been changed within FIFA’s administration and around FIFA.”  “Definitely, the current situation doesn’t help to finalize any new agreements, it’s a fact, and I’m sure that until the next election, until February 26, there (will be) no major (sponsorship) announcements.” FIFA President Sepp Blatter is stepping down and a replacement will be chosen in February. Valcke also signaled that he would be leaving his job then. Valcke said that despite the current difficulties there was still enough time before the 2018 World Cup, to be held in Russia, to sign up new partners. The current sponsors have been goal in demanding changes.  Earlier this month, Coca-Cola urged Zurich-based FIFA to support the creation of an independent body to reform the way it is run. McDonald’s said it had told FIFA that it’s internal controls and compliance culture were not consistent with expectations it has for its business partners. Visa joined in the criticism on Thursday when it also called for an independent reform commission to be set up. “We seek to partner with those who think and act like us,” said Visa Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf. “I don’t believe that FIFA is living up to these standards.” FIFA announced on Monday that it would set up a task force to recommend reforms, however this will be made up of representatives from the continental soccer confederations.  Those confederations are also responsible for electing the members of FIFA’s executive committee.

394,V,"Merchants seek to void $6 billion Visa, MasterCard, AmEx settlements","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Dozens of retailers are seeking to void nearly $6 billion of U.S. antitrust settlements with Visa Inc (V.N), MasterCard Inc (MA.N) and American Express Co (AXP.N) after learning that opposing lawyers exchanged confidential information, potentially tainting the accords. A group of retailers filed papers that remain under seal in the Brooklyn, New York federal court to scuttle their $5.7 billion accord with Visa and MasterCard, which won court approval in 2013, the retailers’ lawyer Owen Glist said in an email. Similar papers were made public in the American Express case on Wednesday in the same court, where retailers opposing the $79 million accord include Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Target Corp (TGT.N) and Home Depot Inc (HD.N) among others. Retailers claimed that the settlements were rigged in light of the discovery of an exchange of emails and other documents between Gary Friedman, a lawyer who represented them, and Keila Ravelo, a lawyer who represented MasterCard while she was a partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher. Friedman and Ravelo had previously been associates at another law firm and become close friends. Their alleged improper communications were discovered by Willkie after Ravelo and her husband were criminally charged in December with stealing from that firm, another law firm and MasterCard. Roy Simon, a Hofstra University legal ethics professor, in a court filing supporting the objecting retailers, said Friedman crossed a line by passing important information to Ravelo, whose firm should in turn have been disqualified. “In my three decades studying professional responsibility for lawyers,” Simon wrote, “I cannot recall ever seeing such repeated and serious violations of professional duties by an attorney representing a class, or such willing participation in those violations by an attorney for a defendant in a class action.” The settlements were meant to resolve claims that the card networks overcharged merchants on interchange fees, or swipe fees, whenever shoppers paid with debit or credit cards. In a Wednesday conference call discussing second-quarter results, MasterCard Chief Executive Ajay Banga called the lawyers’ alleged conduct “pretty disappointing,” but said he was “pretty confident” that the company’s settlement will stand. MasterCard spokesman Seth Eisen declined to elaborate. Visa spokeswoman Connie Kim declined to comment. American Express spokeswoman Marina Norville had no immediate comment. Friedman, in a Wednesday filing in the American Express case, said none of the challenged communications “detracts from the conclusion that this settlement represents the best feasible settlement for the merchant class, and is fair and adequate by any measure.” The cases are In re: Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 05-md-01720; and In re: American Express Anti-Steering Rules Litigation Antitrust Litigation in the same court, No. 11-md-02221.

396,V,"ATM fee lawsuits against Visa, Mastercard, banks revived on appeal","NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court has revived litigation against Visa Inc, Mastercard Inc and several U.S. banks accusing them of conspiring to inflate the prices of ATM access fees in violation of antitrust law. In a decision on Tuesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said a district court erred when it concluded that consumers had no standing to sue and had not adequately alleged antitrust violations. It remanded the three consolidated lawsuits to the district court for further proceedings. The decision revives two class actions brought by consumers and another one brought by independent ATM operators. Their lawsuits accused Visa and MasterCard of adopting rules protecting themselves from competition with lower-cost ATM network. The rules blocked ATM operators from charging less when ATM transactions were processed by networks competing with Visa and Mastercard, the lawsuits said. The rules also benefited major banks, which were equity shareholders of Visa and Mastercard, the lawsuits said. The lawsuits seek damages for consumers and ATM operators for violations of antitrust law. The ruling sends the litigation back to the U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia, where the complaints were dismissed in 2013. Steve Berman, a lawyer for the consumers, said he plans to seek permission to amend the complaints. “This is a big win for consumers, who now can seek not only damages caused by the defendants but can now also pursue an injunction that will spark competition in the ATM market,” Berman said. Matthew Eisenstein, a lawyer for Visa, declined comment. Lawyers for Mastercard could not immediately be reached for comment. Also named as defendants in the lawsuits were Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co.. The lawsuit said that the banks controlled Visa and MasterCard and set higher ATM charges before the credit card companies went public in 2008 and 2006, respectively. Lawyers for the banks could not immediately be reached for comment. In Tuesday’s ruling, the appeals panel said “it can be inferred” that banks continue to benefit from the challenged conduct because they still own shares in Visa and Mastercard.

399,V,U.S. judge rejects American Express class action settlement,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday rejected a proposed class action settlement between American Express Co (AXP.N) and merchants who sued the company over swipe fees, ruling that a lawyer for the merchants compromised the fairness of the agreement. U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn, New York, ruled that lawyer Gary Friedman acted improperly by talking about the case and sharing confidential information with a friend who represented MasterCard Inc (MA.N) in a parallel class action against MasterCard and Visa Inc (V.N). Garaufis wrote that Friedman repeatedly violated court rules meant to protect confidential information and created a conflict of interest.  The violations were so blatant that in at least two emails, Friedman wrote to his friend, “burn after reading.” Garaufis ordered Friedman removed as co-lead counsel for the merchants and ordered a new round of written briefs to be filed in the case by Sept. 8. Two lawyers who represent Friedman could not immediately be reached for comment. The proposed antitrust settlement would have allowed merchants to impose a surcharge on American Express users, potentially treating those cardholders differently from other customers. Such settlements generally require court approval. Merchants were not due to receive any money from the agreement, although Friedman and two other law firms that served as co-lead counsel were due to receive $75 million in fees. American Express said in a statement it was disappointed in the ruling because it considered the settlement agreement fair. It added: “We believe we have strong defenses against the merchants’ claims, and will continue to fight our case in court.”  The case is In Re: American Express Anti-Steering Rules Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, No. 1:11-md-2221.

400,V,FIFA sponsor McDonald's backs independent reform body: group,"ZURICH (Reuters) - World Cup sponsor McDonald’s has joined Coca-Cola and Visa in urging FIFA to adopt an independent reform commission in response to the scandals that have plagued world soccer’s governing body. The campaign group New FIFA Now on Thursday published an email from a McDonald’s saying the fast food giant supports the creation of an independent body to deal with FIFA’s problems.     “In regards to an independent reform commission, we do believe this is an important step in the greater reform that has to happen within FIFA,” McDonald’s vice-president of global media relations and issues management, Heidi Barker Sa Shekhem wrote in the email.       Previously, McDonald’s had been critical of FIFA and urged change without specifically calling for an independent reform process.     “An independent commission would bring an appropriate level of credibility, transparency, and neutrality to the role, and ultimately provide sponsors and fans across the globe with the confidence that the reform effort is both meaningful and a step in the right direction,” wrote Sa Shekhem.     World soccer’s governing body has been in crisis since May, when nine officials and five marketing executives were charged by the U.S. Justice Department with exploiting the sport for their own gain through bribes of more than $150 million over 24 years.     In the wake of the scandal, FIFA President Sepp Blatter has said he will stand down next February.     Last month FIFA announced they were creating a Reform Task Force made up of ten representatives of its regional confederations and to be chaired by someone from outside of soccer.     That body, which has yet to have its membership announced, is scheduled to make its proposals to FIFA’s executive committee in late September.    Campaigners were critical of the move, saying only an entirely independent body could bring about effective change.      “We applaud McDonald’s for joining with Coca-Cola and Visa. They understand just how vital it is that reform of FIFA is independent of the deep vested interests surrounding the organization and its personnel,” said New FIFA Now co-founder Jaimie Fuller.

The meeting will take place in Zurich, the source told Reuters, although no further details were available. FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke said last month that Coca-Cola, Visa and McDonald’s had written asking for information about what was being done to clean up governance of the sport and offering to meet soccer’s ruling body. Valcke’s announcement came after Coca-Cola and Visa urged FIFA to support the creation of an independent body to reform the way it is run. McDonald’s said it had told FIFA that its internal controls and compliance culture were not consistent with the expectations it had for its business partners. Coca-Cola confirmed in a statement that they would be involved. “The Coca-Cola Company will be participating in the working session with FIFA. We are not providing any further details at this time,” it said. FIFA was thrown into turmoil in May when U.S. prosecutors indicted nine soccer officials, most of whom had FIFA positions, and five marketing and broadcasting company executives over a range of alleged offences. The charges included fraud, money-laundering and racketeering. Visa and McDonald’s did not initially respond to requests for comment on the meeting. FIFA has set up a new Reform Committee, headed by former International Olympic Committee (IOC) director general Francois Carrard. However, critics say it lacks independence as it is made up mostly of members of the continental confederations who also elect the members of the executive committee.

405,V,Visa: Consumers using it online finish transactions more than those using PayPal,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Visa Inc said on Monday online shoppers using its payment service are 17 percentage points more likely to complete their purchases than those using PayPal. Visa Checkout, which allows shoppers to store their payment information without having to re-enter it every time they make a purchase online, said 66 percent of its enrolled customers completed their transactions after putting items in their shopping cart compared to 49 percent of PayPal Holdings Inc’s Express Checkout customers. The data was collated for Visa by retail analytics firm ComScore Inc.  PayPal’s online payment service offers a similar convenience by allowing customers to log into their accounts on a merchant’s website.

412,V,RPT - INSIGHT-JPMorgan uses its might to cut costs in credit card market,"(Repeats for additional subscribers) By David Henry NEW YORK, Sept 8 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co. is cutting prices for a group of its credit card customers and getting Visa Inc to shoulder at least some of the burden of the lost revenue, underscoring how the largest U.S. bank’s size can help it hang onto business in fiercely competitive markets. At stake are the billions of dollars that banks receive annually from consumer use of a credit card to pay a retailer. Chase, which generated roughly $3.6 billion of revenue last year from those fees, is increasingly occupied with fending off banking rivals like Citigroup Inc, as well as Silicon Valley companies such as Paypal Inc and Square Inc. Chase’s revenue from those fees is showing signs of eroding. In the first half of 2015, fee income in the bank’s credit and debit card business fell 2 percent from the same period a year earlier, even as the bank processed a higher volume of transactions. A person familiar with the matter said lower processing fees were a critical part of that decline. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon pledged in an April letter to shareholders “to be very aggressive in growing this business.” At a conference with securities analysts in February, he cited the credit card operation as an example of how JPMorgan has to cut prices and upgrade products to keep from falling behind competitors. “In a capitalist world,” Dimon said, “you’ve got to be giving the client more, better, faster, quicker, or you lose.” Credit card fees generated about 4 percent of the bank’s revenue in 2014, but analysts said that much of that money has historically fallen to the bottom line, making it a critical support for the bank’s $22 billion of annual profits. To stem the decline, Chase is assembling a vast array of parts into what will become either a brilliant machine or a makeshift disappointment. A key part of the strategy came in 2013, when Chase inked a deal with Visa that allowed the bank to essentially lease Visa’s network for 10 years at what industry sources said is a fixed rate. There are some signs that the Visa deal is starting to pay off for Chase. This year, the bank won the right to process credit card transactions for customers of Marriott International at some 3,700 hotels in the U.S. and Canada and for Chevron USA at nearly 8,000 gas stations. Steve Mott, an independent payments consultant said, “Fizzle was the watchword until they got the Chevron deal.” Some wonder if the bank is wasting its time. “So far, there is no evidence that it has mattered in a way that changes market share,” said veteran card company analyst Craig Maurer of Autonomous Research. Chase’s efforts are the brainchild of Gordon Smith, the head of JPMorgan’s consumer business, who joined Chase in 2007 after 26 years at American Express. He is trying to recreate large parts of American Express inside of JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank by assets. An American Express spokeswoman declined to comment. To imitate American Express, Smith needed a few components. When a consumer pays for a sweater at a department store with a credit card, three parties usually get involved: money moves from the bank that issues the consumer’s credit card through a network like Visa or MasterCard to the bank that processes transactions for the retailer. Each of those three, the two banks and the network, collects a fee for its role. American Express usually occupies all three links of the chain. But Chase, without borrowing Visa’s network, was only able to be two of the three: the bank for retailers and the bank that issued the credit card to the consumer. The deal that Chase signed with Visa allows the bank to essentially serve as all three links, which in the near term gives it more leeway to cut costs. Longer term, the deal with Visa will allow Chase to corral more information about what its customers are up to, said Mike Passilla, the Chase executive running this effort, in an interview. When a retailer uses Chase to process its credit card transactions, it can now sign up for a service known as ChaseNet, which means that when a consumer buys something with a credit card issued by Chase, the bank will process the transaction from start to finish, essentially serving as all three links in the chain. When that happens, Chase can charge the retailers lower fees for processing partly because of terms it negotiated with Visa, although the details of how much lower the charges can be have not been disclosed. Consumers may never know that ChaseNet exists. Their cards feature a Visa brand, and they can use them wherever Visa cards are accepted. ChaseNet works only when Chase is both the consumer’s bank and the retailer’s bank. That could happen fairly often, because Chase is second only to American Express among U.S. issuers in spending on cards, with market share of 19.4 percent last year, according to the Nilson Report. Chase is the biggest U.S. card issuer by outstanding balances, according to Nilson. Having the chance to cut fees for retailers is important now because many merchants are pressing on every front for lower processing costs. Retailers have won court cases against card companies over pricing in recent years. Mark Horwedel, CEO of the Merchants Advisory Group, said merchants expect more concessions because they have seen regulators in Europe move to cap fees on credit cards at about 15 percent of U.S. levels. Costco Wholesale Corp is widely believed to have chiseled lower fees out of Citigroup and Visa when it decided to stop using American Express as its transaction processing bank, and to stop putting its brand on American Express cards. Costco declined to comment on the specific terms of its agreement with Citi and Visa. Neither Visa, nor Chase, which is the biggest issuer of its cards, have disclosed the terms of their deal, but payments experts believe both sides had reasons to sign on the dotted line. For Visa, it was the chance to lock in 10 years of business from the biggest issuer on their network, without the fear of their fleeing for rival MasterCard Inc. For Chase, the deal gives it the chance to run as much additional volume over the network as it can gather for no extra cost, which gives it more leeway to cut rates to retailers, two people in the industry said. The bank’s sales pitch has worked on at least some companies. Michael Cullen, a finance executive for Marriott International, said that Chase’s deal with his hotel company will yield “significant” cost savings. He added that the bank’s history of investments in its credit card business gives him confidence that Chase will keep up with technology and customer demand for advanced payment devices and spending information. “Payment processing is such an important part of the business,” Cullen said. “You’re going to go with the provider that has the technology and the customer base and is investing.”    (Reporting by David Henry; Editing by Dan Wilchins and John Pickering)",9082015,http://www.reuters.com/article/jpmorganchase-creditcards-insight-graphi/rpt-insight-jpmorgan-uses-its-might-to-cut-costs-in-credit-card-market-idUSL1N11A29H20150908

Sam’s Club will also accept Amex’s Bluebird prepaid debit card, sold in Wal-Mart stores, which was launched in 2012 as an alternative to bank checking accounts that can carry high fees. American Express lost a crucial relationship with Sam’s Club competitor Costco Wholesale Corp earlier this year. Costco stopped accepting Amex cards exclusively, and switched to Visa instead. Citigroup Inc will issue Costco Visa credit cards. Amex said in February the loss of Costco would hurt its earnings for the next two years, and threaten nearly 8 percent of the worldwide annual spending on its cards. Sam’s Club says it is the eighth largest U.S. retailer, with more than 650 locations in the United States and Puerto Rico. It accepts MasterCard Inc’s MasterCard and Discover Financial Services Inc’s Discover card in its physical stores. Online, Sam’s Club already accepts American Express, in addition to Mastercard, Discover, and Visa Inc’s Visa. Wal-Mart’s main stores already accept American Express.

416,V,U.S. judge certifies class action over Target Corp data breach,"(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday certified a class action against Target Corp brought by several banks over the retailer’s massive data breach in 2013. U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson in St. Paul, Minnesota, said the banks could pursue their claims together over the breach, which compromised at least 40 million credit cards during the holiday season. In a statement, Charles Zimmerman, one of the lead lawyers representing the banks, said, “This important ruling brings financial institutions one step closer to collectively holding Target accountable for its unprecedented data breach.” Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said the company was “disappointed” and would evaluate its next steps after reviewing the decision. The ruling, which makes a settlement with the banks more likely, comes four weeks after Target agreed to pay as much as $67 million to financial institutions that issue Visa Inc  cards, in a deal struck directly with the credit card network. Earlier this year, a proposed $19 million settlement with MasterCard Inc fell through when not enough banks accepted the agreement. It is not clear how many Visa card issuers accepted the terms of that deal by the deadline of Sept. 4. Snyder declined to comment on the number of institutions that have agreed to participate in the Visa deal but emphasized that the class action includes only those card issuers that have not settled their claims. Attorney Zimmerman has said the Visa deal, like the failed MasterCard settlement, does not fully reimburse banks for their losses and was negotiated without input from the plaintiffs. Carrie Hunt, the general counsel for the National Association of Federal Credit Unions, praised the judge’s decision and said it “constitutes one important avenue for recovery” for credit unions affected by the breach. The Target breach was one in a series of high-profile data security failures to hit major retailers, including Home Depot Inc and Staples Inc.

The report said several unnamed financial industry sources told Krebs that the incident may still be ongoing and could date back as far as November 2014. “Unfortunately the possibility of fraudulent credit card activity is all too common for every company in today’s marketplace,” a Hilton spokesman said in a statement. “We take any potential issue very seriously, and we are looking into this matter.” The spokesman declined to elaborate on the statement. Krebs, who broke the news of a massive 2013 breach at Target Corp a day before the company announced it, said the cards had been used at the McLean, Virginia-based company’s flagship Hilton locations as well as Embassy Suites, Doubletree, Hampton Inn and Suites, and the upscale Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts.

A lawyer for retailers including Target Corp (TGT.N) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) urged the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York to reject the deal, saying it forces merchants to give up their rights to sue over various policies and practices. “The defendants are trying to buy something that is not for sale,” said Thomas Goldstein, the lawyer. But Paul Clement, a lawyer for merchants who negotiated the deal, said the settlement was fair and provided not just $5.7 billion but reforms an expert valued as worth up to $62 billion. “There was meaningful relief here,” he said. The settlement, the largest in a U.S. antitrust class action, resolved lawsuits by merchants pending since 2005. The lawsuits accused Visa and MasterCard of fixing the fees they were charged each time customers used credit or debit cards. Merchants also claimed Visa and MasterCard prevented retailers from encouraging customers to use cheaper payment methods. U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn in 2013 approved the deal, saying it provided significant monetary award and meaningful relief. The settlement provides for cash payments to merchants and lets them begin charging customers a surcharge when they use Visa or MasterCard credit cards. Around 8,000 merchants, representing 25 percent of the transactional volume at issue, opted out of the deal, driving its value down to $5.7 billion from $7.2 billion. Over 30 lawsuits by those opt-outs are pending. Those retailers say a broad litigation release in the settlement forces current and future merchants who accept Visa or MasterCard to forgo rights to sue over various current and future policies and practices.  The deal’s approval was thrown into further flux after Keila Ravelo, an ex-lawyer at MasterCard’s law firm, was charged in December with engaging in a fraud scheme. Following her arrest, the firm, Willkie Farr & Gallagher, discovered an exchange of communications between Gary Friedman, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, and Ravelo.

422,V,UPDATE 1-China forex regulator says to cap overseas cash withdrawals,"* Regulator caps annual cash withdrawals via UnionPay cards * Annual limit at 100,000 yuan, daily limit at 10,000 yuan * Coincides with recent steps to curb capital outflows * New restrictions also apply to Visa, MasterCard   (Adds details, quotes) BEIJING, Sept 30 (Reuters) - China will introduce an annual cap of 100,000 yuan ($15,734) on cash withdrawals made through UnionPay cards outside the country  from 2016, the nation’s foreign exchange regulator said, to combat money laundering amid concerns about capital flight. Cards issued by Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc  will also be subject to the annual cash withdrawal limit, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) said in a statement on its website. The current rule only sets a daily withdrawal limit of 10,000 yuan per card. For the last three months of this year, the maximum amount of cash that can be withdrawn overseas using a single card will be 50,000 yuan, SAFE said. The step was aimed at curbing “money laundering risks” after it found some unusual activities among card holders, it said. “Recent monitoring found that some UnionPay card holders have made frequent, large cash withdrawals overseas, foreign financial regulators have also alerted on this,” the SAFE said. The announcement by SAFE confirmed an earlier Reuters report. Chinese law prohibits individuals from transferring more than $50,000 out of the country per year, but overseas cash withdrawals via bank cards provided a regulatory loophole. The move coincided with recent steps by China to stem capital outflows. Banks have been told to bolster checks on foreign exchange transactions and identify “abnormal” cross-border fund transfers. Worries over China’s economic slowdown and possible interest rate rises by the U.S. Federal Reserve have led to a wave of capital outflows that intensified after China’s surprise yuan devaluation in August.

424,V,"UPDATE 3-Soccer-Coke, McDonald's join sponsor call for FIFA's Blatter to resign","* Blatter says through U.S. lawyer he will not go * Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Visa, Budweiser demand departure * FIFA image tarnished by Swiss criminal probe of Blatter   (Update with comments) By Mica Rosenberg and Simon Evans NEW YORK/ZURICH, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Major soccer sponsors on Friday issued coordinated calls for the immediate resignation of FIFA president Sepp Blatter in the most significant move by companies supporting the sport since a bribery and corruption scandal erupted at world football’s governing body last May. Coca-Cola Co, McDonald’s, Visa, and Budweiser owner Anheuser-Busch InBev, companies that have long linked their brand names to soccer, on Friday demanded Blatter step down immediately in a strong push for change at the organization. Blatter earlier announced he would resign in February next year. The sponsor statements, all using similar language, came just a week after Swiss authorities said they were opening a criminal investigation into Blatter, the 79-year-old Swiss national who has lead FIFA for the past 17 years. AB InBev said it has been “actively engaged” in the FIFA reform process as part of a group of sponsors. “Every day that passes, the image and reputation of FIFA continues to tarnish,” Coca Cola said. “FIFA needs comprehensive and urgent reform, and that can only be accomplished through a truly independent approach.” Visa and McDonald’s joined the call for Blatter to step aside. “The events of recent weeks have continued to diminish the reputation of FIFA and public confidence in its leadership,” McDonald’s said in an emailed statement. Blatter responded by saying he would not resign, setting the stage for a battle over who should take the helm in the next few months before February when elections are set for a new FIFA president. In a statement from his U.S. lawyer Richard Cullen, Blatter said he believed leaving office would not be in FIFA’s best interest or advance the needed reforms of the organization. Scandals surrounding global soccer exploded in May, when 14 soccer officials and sports marketing executives were indicted on U.S. charges of racketeering, money laundering and wire fraud in relation to bribery schemes that dated back decades. Last Friday, the Swiss Office of the Attorney General said it opened a criminal investigation into Blatter on suspicion of criminal mismanagement and misappropriation of funds. It was the first time that authorities investigating corruption in the world’s most popular sport had pointed the finger directly at Blatter. He has denied wrongdoing and his U.S. attorney said he was cooperating with the Swiss probe. FIFA’s awarding of the 2018 and 2022 competitions to Russia and Qatar is one of the strands under scrutiny from U.S. and Swiss authorities investigating corruption in the organization, a worry for tournament sponsors including McDonald’s, Coca-Cola and Visa. “One of the things consumers are looking for in brands today is for them to be responsible,” said Trevor Wade from the brand consultancy firm Landor. She said the moves by the sponsors was a way to take a public stand about something they think matters to customers. It is an unprecedented decision by companies that have largely stood back as developments in the case unfolded in recent months, said Jaimie Fuller a co-founder of campaign group #NewFifaNow. “The drastic nature of this call stresses the extreme problems faced by FIFA,” Fuller said, “and should show everybody how the sports governing body is teetering on the abyss.”    (Reporting by Simon Evans in Zurich and Mica Rosenberg in New York; Additional reporting by Devika Krishna Kumar and Nandita Bose; Editing by Grant McCool)",10022015,http://www.reuters.com/article/soccer-fifa-coca-cola/update-3-soccer-coke-mcdonalds-join-sponsor-call-for-fifas-blatter-to-resign-idUSL1N1221X920151002

427,V,European banks set for windfall from Visa Europe deal: sources,"LONDON (Reuters) - Europe’s banks are in line to share billions of euros from a buyout of Visa Europe by its U.S. sister company Visa Inc. (V.N), which is expected to be sealed in the next two weeks, sources said. Credit card company Visa is in talks to buy Visa Europe, and proceeds would then be shared by more than 3,000 banks and payment firms that own the network. Visa Inc. wants to re-unite with the European arm to give it more global scale to compete with arch-rival MasterCard (MA.N). It said in July it wanted to conclude talks by the end of October. Sources familiar with the matter said the deal was close to being agreed, with one saying it is earmarked for Oct. 23 or shortly afterwards, once the boards formally approve a deal. Sky News has previously reported Visa Inc.’s offer is worth $21 billion. Britain’s Barclays (BARC.L) could get about $2 billion from a deal, as banks will be paid based on how much business they account for on the Visa Europe network. The data are not publicly available but Barclays accounts for about 10 percent of the business, industry sources estimated. The windfall would be a welcome boost for a European banking sector hit hard over the last few years by the global financial crisis, fines and tighter regulation. The sources estimated British banks account for about 40 percent of Visa Europe’s card payments, so could be in line to receive about $8 billion, or more than 5 billion pounds. Much of the remaining activity is in France, Spain and Italy. That could see major banks including Lloyds (LLOY.L), Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L), HSBC (HSBA.L), Santander (SAN.MC) and BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) in line for hundreds of millions of euros each, sources said. Visa Europe declined to comment and Visa Inc. did not immediately return requests for comment. Visa Europe processed 16.1 billion transactions last year and its cards are used to pay for 1 euro in every 6.1 euros spent in the region.  The structure of the deal is expected to include an upfront payment and some deferred payments, the sources said. That is a complicating factor, however. Any payments that depend on future performance-related measures could be regarded as “locking in” banks to the Visa system and be seen as anti-competitive if they extend for several years, sources said. Another complicating factor regards potential future legal costs due to the threat of lawsuits related to past interchange charges, fees paid between banks on card transactions.  Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have waged lengthy battles against interchange charges and the EU this year capped fees on purchases by debit and credit cards, which will come into effect in December. Visa Europe made a pre-tax profit of 343 million euros  ($389.3 million) in the year to the end of September 2014, on revenues of 1.3 billion euros. It dominates the debit card market, although MasterCard has a bigger share of the credit card market. Under a long-standing agreement Visa Europe has a put option which would oblige Visa Inc to buy it at a price calculated by a formula. Visa Inc. is also free to make an offer to Visa Europe at any time and price.

431,V,Foreign bank card firms fear tough China regulatory regime,"* Foreign firms may have to partner with local cos - sources * China Unionpay currently has monopoly on payment card market * Forcing foreign cos into partnerships may breach 2012 WTO ruling * China tipped to be world’s biggest payment card market by 2020 By Matthew Miller and Michael Martina BEIJING, Oct 27 (Reuters) - China is considering imposing tough new conditions on overseas bank card providers such as Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc, in a potential setback to their plans to enter the country’s $7 trillion card payments market, according to people familiar with discussions. Industry sources, lawyers and U.S. business lobbies are worried that Chinese regulators will push foreign card firms to operate through a domestic consortium and may try to force them to partner with local companies and governments, reducing the amount of control they would have over their businesses and limiting their returns. Such measures, if implemented, would be a blow to global card payment firms, which have been lobbying for more than a decade to access the world’s fastest-growing cards market, projected to become the biggest by 2020. It may also defy a 2012 World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling that found China was discriminating against U.S. credit card firms by allowing China UnionPay, a state-controlled consortium, a monopoly on all yuan payment cards issued and used in the country. The State Council, the government’s cabinet, announced in April that China would open the card market to all properly-licensed domestic and foreign businesses, a move precipitated by the 2012 WTO ruling. But possible new conditions have been raised in discussions between card companies and domestic enterprises and municipal governments in the months since the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) issued its draft implementation regulations, sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Jeremie Waterman, Greater China executive director at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told the U.S. Trade Representative this month in testimony that any foreign card provider may be required to join a domestic consortium to get a licence, limiting their operational control. “We hope the State Council’s April decision ... will allow qualified foreign electronic payments firms to set up bank clearing operations in the near future - even as we are receiving reports that Chinese regulators may award new licences only to those foreign companies that partner with domestic companies,” Waterman said. There have also been discussions about whether to limit the number of licences granted to the foreign card companies, with the possibility that just one or two might be issued, sources said on condition of anonymity. “The concern on the number of licences that will be issued to foreign companies is still there,” one lawyer familiar with the issue told Reuters. Industry watchers expect the PBOC’s implementation regulations to be out imminently. The PBOC declined to comment on the issue and China’s Ministry of Commerce did not respond to a request for comment. The initial qualifications that were publicly outlined by the State Council earlier this year were already seen as onerous by some legal professionals, including requirements that applicants hold 1 billion yuan ($157 million) in registered capital in a local company, and store data and infrastructure inside mainland China. Even if the new conditions are not included in the text of the forthcoming PBOC regulations, there are concerns they could be imposed as unwritten rules. “If you look at other sectors, they are making those kinds of demands in high-tech, automobiles, and commercial airliners. So, that general pressure for foreign companies to partner with state-owned companies is growing,” said Scott Kennedy, Director of the Project on Chinese Business and Political Economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Kennedy said that while lawyers would debate whether such requirements comply with China’s WTO mandate, they would be inconsistent with the spirit of the 2012 ruling and Beijing’s original commitment to open access to financial markets. “I think people would read it for what it is - wanting to make sure that whatever access is given to foreign companies, the benefits still accrue to domestic companies,” Kennedy said. A spokeswoman for Visa declined to comment. MasterCard told Reuters it “has established strong industry partnerships” in China and that open payment systems would promote growth and reduce systemic risk. “We will continue to monitor closely and look forward to the day when we can compete for domestic business in China,” the company said in a statement. MasterCard and UnionPay signed an agreement in 2010 to issue co-branded cards that Chinese people could use when travelling overseas. Critics have argued China’s limitations on foreign card players sought to protect the country’s then nascent domestic industry from competition, allowing UnionPay unfettered access at a time of explosive growth in the interbank card market. Currently, China requires all foreign card companies to use UnionPay’s network when accepting yuan payments, effectively giving it a cut of every credit or debit card transaction. Foreign card issuers in most other countries pay only the bank involved in the transaction because they can use their own networks. At the same time, UnionPay has been expanding rapidly outside China as it battles MasterCard and Visa for global market share. UnionPay is now the world’s largest card brand with more than 5 billion cards issued internationally since its founding in 2002.

432,V,Visa to buy Visa Europe in deal worth as much as $23 billion,"(Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N) said on Monday it would buy former subsidiary Visa Europe Ltd for up to $23.3 billion in a deal that will give the world’s largest payments network a chance to cut costs over the long term and raise fees in the second-biggest card market. The price for the long-anticipated deal was higher than many had expected, but ended a period of strategic uncertainty that had dogged Visa in recent months. Visa Inc and Visa Europe, a cooperative of European banks with more than 500 million cards, were part of a global bank-owned network until 2007. Most of the units merged to form Visa Inc, which went public in 2008, leaving Visa Europe as a separate entity. The deal brings all of Visa’s networks under one roof again, cementing its lead over nearest-rival MasterCard Inc (MA.N). By value of payments, Visa Europe had a 52.2 percent share of the European card market in 2013. (bit.ly/1HVUjqe) Visa said it would pay 16.5 billion euros up front in cash and convertible preferred stock, with potential for an additional payment of up to 4.7 billion euros based on revenue targets four years after the deal closes. More than 3,000 companies stand to profit from the deal. Barclays Plc (BARC.L), the most active bank in the Visa Europe network, is likely to be the biggest winner, Bernstein analyst Chirantan Barua wrote in a note. Barclays said in a statement that it expected an after-tax profit of about 400 million pounds ($619 million) next year when the deal closes. The bank could receive up to 1.2 billion euros in total, a person familiar with the matter said. Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY.L) said it expected a pretax gain of about 300 million pounds when the deal closes, while payment services provider Worldpay Group Plc WPG.L said it expected about 1.25 billion euros from the deal, including 592 million euros when it closes. Visa said it was targeting savings of $200 million from the deal in 2020, a 30 percent reduction from the current run rate. Much of the savings will come from integration of technology. Currently, Visa Europe charges the banks - its owners - less than MasterCard. That is likely to change, analysts said.  “We will work with our banks, who formally were members, to come up with relationships that are more commercial than what you might have struck when you were dealing with an owner,” Chief Financial Officer Vasant Prabhu told Reuters. Chief Executive Charlie Scharf declined to disclose details on pricing in Europe on a call with analysts. Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria was among those who had expected Visa to pay a lower price. Luria and others had expected a deal worth $20 billion-$21 billion. Visa, whose shares were down 3.4 percent at $74.98 in afternoon trading, also reported a slightly lower-than-expected quarterly profit, due mainly to higher costs. The deal, which will be partly funded by the issue of senior unsecured debt of up to $16 billion, is expected to be dilutive to full-year adjusted earnings in fiscal 2016, but accretive to revenue and earnings growth in 2017. Visa said it would increase a buyback program by $5 billion for Class A common stock in 2016 and 2017 to offset the effects of issuing the preferred stock. Visa said its fourth-quarter net income jumped about 41 percent to $1.51 billion, or 62 cents per diluted class A share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, just short of the average analyst estimate of 63 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

That is likely to change, analysts said. “We will work with our banks, who formally were members, to come up with relationships that are more commercial than what you might have struck when you were dealing with an owner,” Chief Financial Officer Vasant Prabhu told Reuters. Chief Executive Charlie Scharf declined to disclose details on pricing in Europe on a call with analysts. Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria was among those who had expected Visa to pay a lower price. Luria and others had expected a deal worth $20 billion-$21 billion. Visa, whose shares were down 3.4 percent at $74.98 in afternoon trading, also reported a slightly lower-than-expected quarterly profit, due mainly to higher costs. The deal, which will be partly funded by the issue of senior unsecured debt of up to $16 billion, is expected to be dilutive to full-year adjusted earnings in fiscal 2016, but accretive to revenue and earnings growth in 2017. Visa said it would increase a buyback program by $5 billion for Class A common stock in 2016 and 2017 to offset the effects of issuing the preferred stock. Visa said its fourth-quarter net income jumped about 41 percent to $1.51 billion, or 62 cents per diluted class A share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, just short of the average analyst estimate of 63 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

U.S. factory activity slowed in October but came in ahead of expectations, while two reports showed manufacturing in China shrank but at a slower pace. In Europe, German manufacturing activity expanded, albeit at a slower clip. “The global economy is on track for growth,” said Ed Hyland, global investment specialist at J.P.

U.S. stocks ended October on Friday with their strongest monthly performance in four years, driven partly by largely positive earnings reports. “We’re seeing new money being allocated to equities after October’s very strong performance,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York. Visa was down about 3.1 percent at $75.17 after offering to buy Visa Europe for as much as $23.34 billion. Visa also reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit.

U.S. factory activity slowed in October. But, while the Institute for Supply Management’s national manufacturing index slipped to 50.1, it was ahead of the expected reading of 50.0. China’s official factory data on Sunday showed activity unexpectedly shrank again in October, but a private survey showed on Monday that the pace of decline has slowed.

447,V,"UPDATE 1-Fidelity drops credit card partners American Express, Bank of America","(Adds share price information, company comments, paragraphs 3, 6-8) By Tim McLaughlin BOSTON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments said on Monday it is dropping long-time credit card partners American Express Co and Bank of America Corp, ending a 12-year partnership that has generated billions of dollars in fees. Boston-based Fidelity, which has 24 million customers, said its new partners will be U.S. Bancorp and Visa Inc , effective Monday. The exclusive alliance will provide Visa branded credit-card products to U.S. consumers, including Fidelity customers. The switch is another setback for American Express, already reeling from its lost deal with warehouse club retailer Costco Wholesale Corp. AmEx said earlier this year the loss of the Costco contract would hurt profit for two years. AmEx shares are off 25 percent over the past year and were down 2.9 percent Monday morning. Many other major U.S. financial stocks were also lower, with shares of Bank of America, Visa Inc and U.S. Bancorp all down by more than 2 percent. Ram Subramaniam, president of Fidelity’s retail brokerage business, did not give any specific reason for ending the partnership with American Express and Bank of America. “It’s been a long, good partnership,” he said. A spokeswoman for American Express said the Fidelity portfolio accounts for less than 1 percent of billings. A Bank of America spokeswoman said the agreement not to continue the relationship with American Express was a mutual decision between the two companies. “Over the past several years, Bank of America has been exiting from our financial institutions card business where Bank of America has limited opportunity to deepen customer relationships, and this move is consistent with that strategy,” she wrote via email. Since 2003, Fidelity has offered 2 percent cash back credit cards with American Express and Bank of America’s FIA Card Services. During that time Fidelity customers have earned $1.1 billion cash rewards. The new alliance will feature cards with chip security technology, with access to digital wallets that include Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Android pay. The new card program will issue the Fidelity Rewards Visa Signature Card and the Fidelity Investments 529 College Rewards Visa Signature Card, where card members can earn unlimited 2 percent cash back with no annual fees, caps or categories when directing rewards into eligible Fidelity accounts.

453,V,Visa does not lower full-year forecast as Wall Street had expected,"(Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N), the world’s largest payments network operator, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit and did not lower its full-year forecasts as many Wall Street analysts were expecting. Visa’s strong report on Thursday comes amid fears of a global economic slowdown and a strong dollar, and helped send the company’s shares up more than 3 percent in extended trading. The company said it was maintaining the full-year profit and revenue forecasts issued on Nov. 2, but said moderating cross-border volume growth and subdued U.S. activity could affect its results. Since Visa last gave its forecast, analysts on average had reduced their profit estimate by nearly 5 percent and their revenue estimate by nearly 2 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “They maintained their guidance inspite of very concerning commentary around the global economy,” said Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. Visa had forecast adjusted class A earnings per share to rise in the low-end of the mid-teens percentage range on a constant dollar basis and revenue to rise in the high single-digit to low double-digit range on a constant dollar basis. Investors will find it encouraging that Visa continues to perform well despite of the issues in various parts of the world, Luria said. The average value of the dollar against a basket of currencies was 11.7 percent higher in the latest fourth quarter compared with the same quarter a year earlier. Visa’s total payments volume rose 11 percent to $1.3 trillion on a constant dollar basis in the three months ended Dec. 31. U.S. payment volumes, which account for more than half of its total payment volumes, jumped 9.5 percent. That helped boost total operating revenue rose 5.4 percent to $3.57 billion.

470,V,"Visa lowers revenue forecast, amends Visa Europe deal","(Reuters) - Visa Inc, the world’s largest payments network operator, lowered its full-year revenue forecast, blaming lack of improvement in cross-border spending.  Shares of the company, which is amending its deal to buy Visa Europe, fell 4.7 percent to $77 in after-market trading on Thursday. The stock — a Dow component — had risen 4.2 percent this year. Chief Financial Officer Vasant Prabhu on a conference call blamed weaker U.S. payment volumes due to gas prices and weakness in large commodity-based economies like Brazil for the lowered forecast.  Visa, which reported a better-than-expected profit for its second quarter ended March 31, said it swapped the earn-out option in its deal to buy Visa Europe for an increased cash consideration, following feedback from the European Commission. “The elimination of that earn out means the European banks can switch away from Visa sooner than they would have previously,” said Gil Luria, a Wedbush Securities analyst. The cash consideration of the deal will be increased by 1.75 billion euros ($1.97 billion), the company said. Visa said last year it would pay 16.5 billion euros upfront in cash and convertible preferred stock, with potential for an additional payment of up to 4.7 billion euros based on revenue targets four years after the deal closes. The company said it expects its full-year revenue to grow between 7 percent to 8 percent, lower than its previous forecast of high single-digit to low-double digit. On a constant-dollar basis, adjusted earnings per Class A share is now expected to grow in low single-digits, compared with its previous forecast of low-end of mid-teens. The company’s net income rose 10 percent to $1.71 billion in the second quarter, helped by a 10.5 percent jump in U.S. payment volumes. Payments on Visa’s U.S. cards account for more than half of the company’s total transaction volume. Excluding items, the company earned 68 cents per Class A share, beating analysts’ average estimate by a cent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

475,V,Visa calls travel projections for Olympics 'reassuring',"(Reuters) - Visa Inc is forecasting 400,000 to 500,000 international visitors to Rio de Janeiro in August, a projection one of its top marketing executives called “reassuring” given economic and health issues swirling around the August games in Brazil.  Chris Curtin, Visa’s chief brand and innovation marketing officer, said those figures are based on an “enormous amount of transactions” in Visa’s network in the region ranging from hotel nights, entertainment to transportation, as well as third-party historical data. Visa’s projections are higher than a 2014 prediction from Brazil’s tourism agency of 380,000 foreign visitors, while they are lower than the 590,000 foreign visitors who went to the United Kingdom for the last summer Olympics in 2012, according to UK government statistics.  The Rio Games run from Aug. 5-21 this year. Brazil was awarded the Olympics in 2009 when it was enjoying a period of strong economic growth, but has since fallen into its worst recession in decades, dragged down by a collapse in commodity prices. Brazil’s President Dilma Rousseff could also be forced from office before the Olympics, after losing an impeachment vote which has paralyzed her government.  At the same time, the country is waging a battle against the Zika virus, which is linked to birth defects in newborns. It is the first time that Visa is projecting Olympic travel attendance. The company has a unique vantage point on such plans because, as a sponsor of the International Olympic Committee since 1986, it is the only form of payment accepted besides cash for Olympic tickets and travel packages. Its data, combined with historical attendance and spending, shows “a lot of demand for getting to Brazil” to participate in or watch the Olympics, Curtin said in an interview.  About 45 percent of travelers will come from Latin America and the Caribbean, 30 percent from Europe and only 15 percent from North America, Visa predicts. U.S. travelers were the biggest spenders at the last summer Olympics, spending $91 million in London in 2012. Travel to Brazil will increase by 1.2 million travelers in 2016 compared with the average amount of tourists between 2010 and 2015.  Visa did not make a prediction of how much an average visitor to the games will spend. It said, however, that travelers to the London 2012 Olympic games spent an average of $1830, twice as much per visit as a typical tourist to the United Kingdom that year.  “(The Olympics) will bring the best of the world to Brazil at a time when Brazil could clearly use support and assistance,” Curtin said.

A Walmart Canada spokesman said the retailer pays more than C$100 million ($78.27 million) in credit card fees every year, but specific transaction fees are part of “confidential agreements.” Canadian retailers have long complained about what they call the high interchange fees they pay credit card companies. In 2014 Visa and MasterCard Inc said they would trim Canadian transaction rates to an average effective rate of 1.5 percent, after complaints about their fees almost resulted in government intervention. Unlike American Express Co, which typically negotiates a flat fee with every merchant, Visa and MasterCard have variable fees based on the status of their different cards. Small retailers, which usually have less power to negotiate transaction terms, have said that hurts them as they are never sure of the exact rate they will be billed between 1 percent and 3 percent on any given transaction. Walmart Canada said stores in Thunder Bay in the northwestern part of the Ontario province will be the first to stop accepting Visa cards, and the change will then be rolled out “in phases” to the rest of the more than 370 Canadian Walmart stores.

490,V,"Visa launches Olympics campaign, undeterred by woes in Brazil","(Reuters) - Visa Inc, one of the Olympics’ top global sponsors, kicks off its global advertising campaign for the Summer Games on Sunday with no plans to cut back on its Olympic presence despite difficulties in host country Brazil.  The U.S. payment provider said it has seen no significant cancellations in trips to Rio de Janeiro, either among its own team or Olympic ticket and travel package purchasers, over concerns of an outbreak of the Zika virus and political upheaval in Brazil.  “We are being very proactive about preparing our employees, guests and clients and customers who will be attending for eventualities that might occur, but we feel pretty good about it,” Lynne Biggar, Visa’s chief marketing and communications officer, said in an interview.  “We have not seen any different pattern of cancellation than we do in any Olympic games,” she added.  The company has a unique vantage point on travel plans because, as a sponsor of the International Olympic Committee since 1986, it provides the only form of payment accepted besides cash for official Olympic tickets and packages. Visa expects 400,000 to 500,000 visitors to attend the Rio Games, which run from Aug. 5-21, the first Olympics ever to be held in South America. Brazil was awarded the Olympics in 2009, when it was enjoying a period of strong economic growth, but has since fallen into its worst recession in decades. Congress has suspended President Dilma Rousseff while she faces an impeachment trial.  The country is waging the world’s most serious battle against Zika, a mosquito-borne virus that is linked to the birth defect microcephaly. The World Health Organization has advised that pregnant women avoid travel to Zika outbreak areas. Visa's global ad campaign kicks off Sunday night when it will air its first Olympics commercial during Game 7 of the National Basketball Association finals. It features the top athletes it sponsors such as U.S. swimmer Missy Franklin, Mexico's taekwondo athlete Maria Espinoza, South African sprinter Wayde van Niekerk and Canadian divers Jennifer Abel and Pamela Ware, carpooling to the Olympics.  (youtu.be/wrAiclq3dw8) The commercial, narrated by actor Morgan Freeman, is a change of tone from the past Olympics, Biggar said. In previous years, Visa focused more on the brand and less on how people can use their products. Athletes in the new ad are seen paying for items using chip cards and other Visa products en route to the games. “We are thinking a little bit more playfully and youthfully,” Biggar said, adding that in past years the commercials were “more corporate and staid.”  Visa is sponsoring 46 Olympic athletes this year, up from 37 at the Winter Games in Sochi. It also created 17 cuts of the commercial that can be used in different international markets such as Mexico, Canada and the Middle East that will feature local athletes carpooling to Rio.  While Visa declined to disclose what it spends on its global sponsorship deals with the International Olympic Committee, a source familiar with the matter said a top sponsor like Visa pays about $25 million per year for four years, or $100 million total for a summer and winter games.

493,V,Visa windfall gives European banks Q2 boost,"LONDON, June 22 (IFR) - Dozens of European banks will book hefty windfalls in the second quarter from the sale of their stakes in Visa Europe, after Visa Inc this week completed the purchase of its sister card payments firm. Barclays is set to be the biggest beneficiary due to the amount of trading on its Visa cards, booking a gain of about £396m now the sale has completed. The British bank will also receive shares in Visa and another cash payment in 2019 that could see it reap about 1.2bn from the sale, people familiar with the matter have previously said. Most other major European banks - including Lloyds, HSBC, Intesa Sanpaolo, Santander and Caixabank - will also get a second-quarter windfall of varying size depending on how active they are on the Visa network. That income will be timely, as bank profits are under pressure from sluggish economies and weak trading income. US card giant Visa agreed to buy Visa Europe for up to US$23.3bn in November, in a deal that unites the two arms of the world’s largest payments network. The proceeds will be shared by more than 3,000 banks and payment firms that own the European network. Visa and Visa Europe were part of a global bank-owned network until 2007, when Visa Europe became a separate entity. It has more than 500m cards in issue and had a 52% share of the European card market in 2013. Under November’s deal, Visa said it will pay 16.5bn up front in cash and convertible preferred stock, with potential for an additional payment of up to 4.7bn. Visa Europe’s members have this week received shares in Visa as well as the cash payment, and will get another cash payment on the third anniversary of closing, the size of which will depend on future net revenue for the business. UK banks could receive about 40% of the proceeds, because of the popularity of the Visa network in Britain, people have previously estimated. Much of the remaining activity is in France, Spain and Italy. Some banks have this week disclosed the second-quarter profit boost they will get, although some said most of the capital benefit was booked in 2015 results when the deal was struck. Italy’s Intesa Sanpaolo said the deal will result in a second-quarter net capital gain of around 150m and Spain’s Caixabank said it expected a gain of 115m. Austria’s Raiffeisen Bank International said it will get 97m from the initial cash payment and Britain’s Co-operative Bank said it will recognise a gain of £62m in its half-year results. Lloyds has previously said it expected a pretax gain of about £300m from the upfront cash payment when the deal closed. Payment services provider Worldpay Group said the sale of its 5.9% interest in Visa Europe will bring in 1.25bn. That consists of an upfront cash payment of 592m, 374m in Visa shares and a future payment of up to 283m.

499,V,Visa countersues Wal-Mart in debit card PIN vs signature case,"(Reuters) - Visa Inc filed a lawsuit against Wal-Mart Stores Inc on Wednesday, claiming the retailer secretly began testing a protocol that eliminated the need for signature verifications for transactions paid for with a Visa debit card. The lawsuit comes about a month after Wal-Mart had sued Visa saying the payments network operator was resisting the use of personal identification numbers (PINs) by customers for purchases made on debit cards at Walmart stores. Visa said Wal-Mart did not disclose the PIN-only policy to Visa and noted a significant drop in debit card transactions at Walmart stores as well as customer complaints on their inability to use their debit cards at Walmart stores without a PIN, according to a filing in a New York court. “Instead of complying with the terms of the commercial agreement that the two companies negotiated and agreed to in 2015, Walmart is attempting to avoid its obligation to provide a signature option for their customers when paying with a Visa debit card,” Visa said in an e-mailed statement. Wal-Mart disagreed with the allegations. “We have rightfully insisted on the use of PINs for debit card transactions in our stores, while Visa has continued to demand the more fraud-prone signature verification which is more profitable to them,” Wal-Mart spokesman Randy Hargrove said. Wal-Mart and other U.S. retailers have pushed their payment partners to allow customers to use PINs instead of old-school signatures in a bid to prevent counterfeit card fraud.

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said some of the retailers were inadequately represented in the case. It also decertified the case as a class action. The settlement was intended to resolve nearly a decade of litigation concerning whether Visa and MasterCard improperly fixed fees that merchants were charged when customers used credit or debit cards.   (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)",6302016,http://www.reuters.com/article/visa-mastercard-settlement/visa-mastercard-antitrust-settlement-with-merchants-is-voided-idUSL1N19M0UN
503,V,"Visa, MasterCard $7.25 billion settlement with retailers is thrown out","NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Thursday threw out a $7.25 billion antitrust settlement reached by Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) with millions of retailers that accused the card networks of improperly fixing credit and debit card fees. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said the accord was unfair to retailers that stood to receive no payments and, in the court’s view, little or no benefit at all. It also decertified the case as a class action. “This is not a settlement; it is a confiscation,” wrote Circuit Judge Pierre Leval, a member of the three-judge panel that unanimously struck down the settlement. The deal had been the largest all-cash U.S. antitrust settlement, though its value shrank to about $5.7 billion after roughly 8,000 retailers “opted out.” Thursday’s decision is a blow to the credit card industry, which hoped the settlement would end a decade of litigation brought on behalf of about 12 million retailers against Visa, MasterCard and banks that issue their cards. It was intended to resolve claims that merchants were overcharged on interchange fees, or swipe fees, when shoppers used credit or debit cards, and were barred from directing customers toward cheaper means of payment. The settlement may now need to be renegotiated, or the case could go to trial. “Swipe fees are an improper and unnecessary hidden tax on consumers,” said Jeffrey Shinder, a Constantine Cannon partner representing Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and other opponents of the accord. “The structure of swipe fees is back on the table.” Visa spokeswoman Connie Kim said the Foster City, California-based company is reviewing the decision. MasterCard spokesman Seth Eisen said the company, based in Purchase, New York, is disappointed in the decision and will review its next steps. Visa shares closed down $2.57, or 3.3 percent, at $74.17. MasterCard fell $4.07, or 4.4 percent, to $88.06. The S&P; 500 Information Technology Index .SPLRCT, which includes both, rose 1.1 percent. U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn had approved the settlement in December 2013, saying it offered “significant” damages and meaningful protections against future harm. Many retailers and trade groups nevertheless objected. Some said the payout should have been higher. Others said the accord would have made it too hard to sue Visa and MasterCard. Wal-Mart, in a statement, said the settlement would also have “stifled innovation around new payments technologies and left consumers facing continually increasing hidden swipe fees.” Card issuers American Express Co (AXP.N) and Discover Financial Services (DFS.N) also objected to the settlement. The National Retail Federation said retailers pay roughly $60 billion annually in swipe fees, which typically average around 2 percent. Mallory Duncan, the group’s general counsel, told Reuters in an interview that the settlement would have “forever” shielded card networks from a variety of litigation, while giving retailers “at best” three cents on the dollar in damages. Thursday’s decision “will give real incentives to the card networks to rethink their anti-competitive behavior,” he said.

504,V,"Visa, MasterCard $7.25 bln settlement with retailers is thrown out","NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Thursday threw out a $7.25 billion antitrust settlement reached by Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc with millions of retailers that accused the card networks of improperly fixing credit and debit card fees. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said the accord was unfair to retailers that stood to receive no payments and, in the court’s view, little or no benefit at all. It also decertified the case as a class action. “This is not a settlement; it is a confiscation,” wrote Circuit Judge Pierre Leval, a member of the three-judge panel that unanimously struck down the settlement. The deal had been the largest all-cash U.S. antitrust settlement, though its value shrank to about $5.7 billion after roughly 8,000 retailers “opted out.” Thursday’s decision is a blow to the credit card industry, which hoped the settlement would end a decade of litigation brought on behalf of about 12 million retailers against Visa, MasterCard and banks that issue their cards. It was intended to resolve claims that merchants were overcharged on interchange fees, or swipe fees, when shoppers used credit or debit cards, and were barred from directing customers toward cheaper means of payment. The settlement may now need to be renegotiated, or the case could go to trial. “Swipe fees are an improper and unnecessary hidden tax on consumers,” said Jeffrey Shinder, a Constantine Cannon partner representing Amazon.com Inc, Costco Wholesale Corp , Wal-Mart Stores Inc and other opponents of the accord. “The structure of swipe fees is back on the table.” Visa spokeswoman Connie Kim said the Foster City, California-based company is reviewing the decision. MasterCard spokesman Seth Eisen said the company, based in Purchase, New York, is disappointed in the decision and will review its next steps. Visa shares closed down $2.57, or 3.3 percent, at $74.17. MasterCard fell $4.07, or 4.4 percent, to $88.06. The S&P; 500 Information Technology Index, which includes both, rose 1.1 percent. U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn had approved the settlement in December 2013, saying it offered “significant” damages and meaningful protections against future harm. Many retailers and trade groups nevertheless objected. Some said the payout should have been higher. Others said the accord would have made it too hard to sue Visa and MasterCard. Wal-Mart, in a statement, said the settlement would also have “stifled innovation around new payments technologies and left consumers facing continually increasing hidden swipe fees.” Card issuers American Express Co and Discover Financial Services also objected to the settlement. The National Retail Federation said retailers pay roughly $60 billion annually in swipe fees, which typically average around 2 percent. Mallory Duncan, the group’s general counsel, told  Reuters in an interview that the settlement would have “forever” shielded card networks from a variety of litigation, while giving retailers “at best” three cents on the dollar in damages. Thursday’s decision “will give real incentives to the card networks to rethink their anti-competitive behavior,” he said.

In a rare example of negotiations between a major retailer and credit card company spilling out in public, Walmart said last month it had been unable to agree with Visa on an “acceptable fee” and would no longer accept the company’s credit cards unless it got a better deal. The decision to stop taking Visa in three stores in Thunder Bay, Ontario, will eventually be mirrored across the more than 370 outlets in the country, Walmart Canada said in a statement on Monday, though it did not give details.  The decision will not affect stores outside Canada, the company said. A spokesman added that Walmart was “optimistic that we will reach an agreement with Visa.” Canadian retailers have long complained about what they call the high interchange fees they pay credit card companies, though representatives of Walmart Canada and Visa have declined to address questions on specifics of payment terms. Visa has taken up ads in several Canadian newspapers, saying Walmart is using its customers as pawns in its bid to get lower fees.

511,V,Visa to sponsor refugee athletes in Olympics,"July 20 (Reuters) - Visa Inc, operator of the world’s largest payments network, said on Wednesday it had signed sponsorship deals with all ten members of the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) refugee team, essentially becoming their first corporate sponsor. The IOC introduced its inaugural refugee team in June to draw global attention to the plight of refugees. The athletes, six men and four women will compete in the sports of swimming, judo and athletics and march with the Olympic flag just before host Brazil at the opening ceremony August 5. The team includes five athletes from South Sudan, two from Syria, two from Democratic Republic of Congo and one from Ethiopia. All are required to have official refugee status, according to the United Nations. Chris Curtin, Visa’s chief marketing innovation and brand officer, said sponsoring refugee athletes ties into the concept of acceptance that is one of the creative threads behind the company’s Olympic campaign, and also an idea consumers associate with credit cards. The company can use the refugees in their marketing campaigns if the IOC approves it. The IOC could not be reached for comment on Visa’s campaign. Some advocates for refugees have questioned whether it is opportunistic for companies to use refugees in advertising campaigns. The value of Visa’s deals with refugee athletes, which it brokered directly with them with the help of the IOC, was not disclosed. Curtin said the contracts are “identical, comparable deals,” to the sponsorship agreements Visa has with more well-known athletes. Visa is working with 60 Olympians and Paralympians ahead of Rio, including U.S. athletes Missy Franklin, beach volleyball player Kerri Walsh Jennings and Ashton Eaton, who won the gold medal in decathlon in London. Visa had previously announced a sponsorship deal with Yusra  Mardini, an elite swimmer who left Syria last August. Mardini and her sister swam for more than three hours in the open sea to get to Greece after the small boat she was on started to capsize. She helped more than a dozen or so people on the boat survive the journey who could not swim. Mardini now trains in Germany. Visa posted a photo of Mardini on its Facebook page with the text “Accept me because I’ve swum against the current to get where I belong.” Visa also had a previous deal with Raheleh Asemani, an Iran-born female athlete in taekwondo who is now representing Belgium.

The company’s payments volume rose 10.2 percent to $1.35 trillion on a constant dollar basis in the quarter ended June 30. Cross-border volumes grew 5 percent during the quarter. “While little has changed in the global economic environment, and cross-border commerce continues to be challenged by a strong U.S. dollar, domestic consumer spend across the globe remains strong and resilient,” Chief Executive Charlie Scharf said in a statement.

Visa completed its acquisition of Visa Europe last month in a deal initially valued at as much as $23.3 billion. The strategic rationale for merging Visa and Visa Europe does not change with or without the Brexit vote, Chief Financial Officer Vasant Prabhu said on a conference call. Visa also said the long-term impact of Britain’s vote to leave the European Union on its business was too early to determine, although it would affect currency exchange rates in the short term. “The Brexit vote has introduced significant uncertainty, which is never good for business sentiment,” Prabhu said.

518,V,PayPal seeks to extend reach with Visa tie-up,"(Reuters) - PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O) moved to extend the reach of its online payments business through a deal with Visa Inc (V.N) that is expected to boost the revenue and number of users of the money-transfer service. The partnership announced on Thursday is intended to make it easier for customers to use Visa credit and debit cards in PayPal transactions and allow shoppers to use PayPal in brick-and-mortar retail locations. It is PayPal’s latest effort to bring its internet payments service to the physical checkout line. In the year since its spinoff from e-commerce company eBay Inc (EBAY.O), becoming an independently traded company on Wall Street for the second time, PayPal has grown aggressively. Its revenue for the second quarter is up more than 15 percent to $2.65 billion from a year ago and the volume of payments it processes is up 28 percent to $86.21 billion, the company said in its quarterly earnings report. The Visa partnership positions PayPal to sign more deals with major financial institutions. On a call with investors on Thursday, PayPal President and Chief Executive Dan Schulman said: “We are in discussions with a variety of players in our ecosystem.” The partnership with Visa allows PayPal users to withdraw cash from their PayPal accounts instantly by using a Visa debit card. The process used to take several hours or days, said Bill Ready, PayPal’s global head of product and engineering. In exchange, Visa will integrate PayPal into its tap-and-pay feature - which allows the shopper to wave a card or mobile phone over a reader to pay - at certain retail locations. PayPal agreed to share data about those transactions. The company declined to offer specifics on the timeline or locations, and some investors questioned the difficulty of getting agreement from merchants.  The deal removes some cost uncertainty for PayPal, as it locks in a set fee PayPal will pay to Visa. Any fee hikes by Visa would be a threat to the company’s profitability. “The partnership with Visa has removed an overhang on our business,” said company Chief Financial Officer John Rainey. But, he added, it also comes with some additional costs from more Visa transactions, at least initially. Still, many investors cheered the partnership as driving “meaningful upside” for PayPal, analyst Bill Carcache of Nomura Securities said in a research note. “A collaboration between PayPal and Visa could present a formidable obstacle to Apple Pay (and) Google Wallet,” added Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT. Shares of San Jose, California-based PayPal shares fell about 2 percent in after-hours trading following the call with investors. At their closing price on the Nasdaq of $40.13, shares are up more than 28 percent over the last six months. Visa shares rose less than 1 percent after the closing bell. Eighteen-year-old PayPal has 188 million active customer accounts, an 11 percent increase over a year ago and a 2 percent rise over the first quarter this year, the company said. About 28 percent, or $24 billion, of its payments are now processed on mobile phones.

In exchange, Visa will integrate PayPal into its tap-and-pay feature - which allows the shopper to wave a card or mobile phone over a reader to pay - at certain retail locations. PayPal agreed to share data about those transactions. The company declined to offer specifics on the timeline or locations, and some investors questioned the difficulty of getting agreement from merchants.  The deal removes some cost uncertainty for PayPal, as it locks in a set fee PayPal will pay to Visa. Any fee hikes by Visa would be a threat to the company’s profitability. “The partnership with Visa has removed an overhang on our business,” said company Chief Financial Officer John Rainey. But, he added, it also comes with some additional costs from more Visa transactions, at least initially. Still, many investors cheered the partnership as driving “meaningful upside” for PayPal, analyst Bill Carcache of Nomura Securities said in a research note. “A collaboration between PayPal and Visa could present a formidable obstacle to Apple Pay (and) Google Wallet,” added Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT. Shares of San Jose, California-based PayPal shares fell about 2 percent in after-hours trading following the call with investors. At their closing price on the Nasdaq of $40.13, shares are up more than 28 percent over the last six months. Visa shares rose less than 1 percent after the closing bell. Eighteen-year-old PayPal has 188 million active customer accounts, an 11 percent increase over a year ago and a 2 percent rise over the first quarter this year, the company said. About 28 percent, or $24 billion, of its payments are now processed on mobile phones.

521,V,UPDATE 1-Visa deal gain lifts Polish lender BZ WBK's 2nd-quarter profit,"* BZ WBK beats market forecasts with net profit of $182.4 mln * Q2 result was boosted by one-off transaction with Visa Europe   (Adds analyst’s comment, shares, details and background) WARSAW, July 27 (Reuters) - Polish lender Bank Zachodni WBK  reported a 34-percent rise in its second-quarter net profit on Wednesday, beating market expectations due to gains from the sale of Visa Europe. The No.3 Polish bank by assets, a unit of Spain’s Banco Santander , said net profit rose to 723.5 million zlotys ($182.4 million), compared with analysts’ expectations of 662 million. Credit and debit card company Visa Inc completed its acquisition of Visa Europe, a cooperative of European banks, in June in a deal initially valued at as much as $23.3 billion. BZ WBK gained 316 million zlotys from the deal. “The net profit is higher than market expectations, as the bank’s result on the Visa deal was better than forecasted,” DM BOS brokerage’s analyst Michal Sobolewski said. BZ WBK results were also boosted by trade results, which almost doubled year-on-year in the second quarter to 90 million zlotys. This includes gains on bond sales and foreign exchange transactions. Net interest income rose 12 percent to 1.15 billion zlotys, while its net fee income fell by 6 percent to 471 million year-on-year. The bank has been hit by a sector-wide bank tax imposed earlier this year. BZ WBK shares have lost more than 1 percent this year, after falling by 24 percent last year. It rose by 1.6 percent in early trade on Wednesday, outperforming the main Warsaw bourse index which lost 0.7 percent. Investors are awaiting a presidential solution for borrowers’ problems with Swiss franc-denominated mortgages, which may cost the banking sector up to 67 billion zlotys. BZ WBK has a significant portfolio of FX loans. President Andrzej Duda is expected to submit a bill on the issue later this year. More than half a million Poles took Swiss franc loans to benefit from low Swiss interest rates, but now face much bigger repayments because the currency has doubled its value over the last few years.

529,V,UPDATE 4-AmEx can bar merchants from steering card customers elsewhere,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Monday cleared the way for American Express Co (AXP.N) to block merchants that accept its cards from steering customers toward lower-cost cards from other issuers. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said a lower court judge in Brooklyn erred in February 2015 in finding that American Express’ “anti-steering” rules violated federal antitrust law. Underlying the case were the fees that merchants pay to process transactions, which the U.S. government estimated at more than $50 billion a year, and which can be passed along to cardholders in the form of higher prices. The lower court judge, Nicholas Garaufis, had found that non-discrimination provisions (NDPs) in American Express’ merchant agreements, meant to dissuade customers from using cards from Visa and MasterCard, unreasonably restrained competition. But the appeals court said Garaufis erred by focusing entirely on the interests of merchants rather than cardholders who might benefit from American Express rewards programs and perceived prestige. “Though merchants may desire lower fees, those fees are necessary to maintaining cardholder satisfaction,” Circuit Judge Richard Wesley wrote for a three-judge panel. “So long as AmEx’s market share is derived from cardholder satisfaction, there is no reason to intervene and disturb the present functioning of the payment-card industry,” he added. Shares of American Express, whose largest shareholder is billionaire Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), closed down 43 cents, or 0.7 percent, at $63.42. The shares had been down about 1.4 percent when the decision was issued. The decision may help American Express compete for space in customer wallets with Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N), whose cards are more plentiful but whose customers spend less. It may also help American Express boost revenue as it cuts costs to help offset the loss of lucrative co-branding relationships such as with Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O). Monday’s decision is also a defeat for the U.S. government and 17 states, led by Ohio, that challenged American Express’ anti-steering rules. Visa and MasterCard settled similar lawsuits in 2011 by agreeing to change their rules. Mark Abueg, a U.S. Department of Justice spokesman, declined to comment. Kate Hanson, a spokeswoman for Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, said that they are reviewing the decision. American Express welcomed the decision.  “Consumers will be able to choose how they pay and our card members will not be discriminated against at the point of sale,” spokeswoman Marina Norville said. Lawyers for dozens of retailers, such as Target Corp (TGT.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), had argued that voiding American Express’ anti-steering rules would encourage competition and drive prices they pay to card networks lower. In his ruling, Garaufis had said the NDPs enabled American Express to wrongfully exploit its 26.4 percent share of purchase volume in the U.S. credit and charge card market. The judge later imposed an injunction that also allowed merchants to offer discounts, rebates and other incentives to customers for using other cards with lower fees. But in December, after American Express said the injunction would cause irreparable harm, the appeals court temporarily lifted that injunction, enabling the company to enforce its rules during the appeal. Monday’s decision means it can continue doing so. Visa and MasterCard together recently had close to 1.2 billion cards in the United States. American Express had 47 million as of June 30, down about 15 percent from 55.3 million a year earlier. The case is U.S. et al v.

Kelly, who already sits on Visa’s board of directors, will take over as CEO following Scharf’s resignation, which is effective Dec. 1. Kelly said in an interview with Reuters that he “got a front row seat to the various opportunities and issues the company faces” as a Visa board member since January 2014. “I don’t come in here expecting to make a lot of big changes,” he said.

The quarterly disclosures of manager stock holdings, in what are known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are always intriguing for investors trying to divine a pattern in what savvy traders are selling and buying. But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some peril because the disclosures are backward looking and come out 45 days after the end of each quarter. Still, the records offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities to make money on the long side. The filings do not disclose short positions, bets that a stock will fall in price. And there is also little disclosure on bonds and other securities that do not trade on exchanges.

549,V,U.S. urges court to overturn AmEx antitrust decision,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Thursday asked a federal appeals court to reconsider a recent antitrust decision allowing American Express Co (AXP.N) to stop merchants from encouraging customers to use rival cards that charge lower fees. In its Sept. 26 decision, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York reversed a lower court ruling that had struck down AmEx’s “anti-steering” rules. At issue are the more than $50 billion of fees that merchants pay annually to process transactions. These fees are largely hidden from customers, but can be passed along to them through higher prices. The appeals court said AmEx can block merchants that accept its cards from steering customers to cheaper cards from Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N), even if the move saved them money. But in Thursday’s filing, the U.S. Department of Justice said the court erred by focusing on how AmEx’s policy affected customers and merchants, rather than merchants alone. The department also said it should not have had to show at the outset that the policy did more harm than good, and that instead AmEx must show how its policy promotes competition. “It is not for AmEx to decide on behalf of the entire market to eliminate merchant-side price competition, forcing all retail customers to subsidize rewards for AmEx’s affluent cardholders,” the Justice Department said. AmEx spokesman Andrew Johnson in a statement said the government’s claims lack merit, and that “if asked to do so by the court, we will oppose the DOJ’s petition vigorously.” The New York-based company accounted for about 26.4 percent of U.S. credit and charge card purchase volume in 2013. Visa and MasterCard settled similar lawsuits in 2011 by agreeing to change their rules. Thursday’s filing seeks reconsideration of the Sept. 26 decision by the original three-judge appeals court panel, or by the court’s 11 active judges in an “en banc” review. The 2nd Circuit rarely grants such requests, and holds en banc hearings at a rate of roughly one every other year. The case is U.S. et al v. American Express Co et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-1672.

555,V,"SCOTUS dismissal of ATM fees case: Visa, MasterCard swung for a home run, called out on strikes","(Reuters) - I doubt that when history books survey the shocking events of November 2016, they will spare many words for the U.S. Supreme Court’s announcement late Thursday that it had dismissed a pair of cases involving credit card networks and ATM fees ranks. But for lawyers in the elite ranks of the Supreme Court bar, the justices’ order – which said that Visa, MasterCard and bank members of credit card networks had changed their argument after persuading the court to take their case -- created a considerable stir in the elite appellate bar, not least because counsel of record for Visa and the other petitioners is Neal Katyal of Hogan Lovells, a former acting U.S. solicitor general and extremely accomplished Supreme Court litigator.  So what happened?  I should say right here that I don’t know for sure. Katyal didn’t respond to my email requesting comment and the lawyers I spoke with didn’t want to go on the record, for the most part. But those conversations and filings in the Supreme Court cases – there were two parallel proceedings with different respondents – suggest that the credit card companies briefed their petitions for Supreme Court review on quite narrow grounds that, even if they prevailed, wouldn’t be especially useful to them in the future. Once they reached the Supreme Court, though, they asserted a bolder argument that, had they won it, would have given their industry broad antitrust protection.  Strategically, in other words, the credit card companies may have been willing to risk the rare indignity of having their cases tossed for the chance of winning a decision worth potentially billions of dollars. The justices don’t seem to have appreciated that gamesmanship.  The underlying litigation alleged that Visa and MasterCard - which at the time operated as associations of member banks - and their member banks violated the Sherman Act by jacking up the fees for independent ATMs to access their networks. A trial judge in Washington, D.C., dismissed the cases, finding, among other things, that the plaintiffs hadn’t shown restraint of trade. The District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals revived the suits in 2015.  An array of distinguished firms represented Visa, MasterCard and the banks in their petition for certiorari: Arnold & Porter; Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom, Morrison & Foerster, Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler and Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison. Their argument was that the D.C. Circuit split with the 9th Circuit in a nearly identical case (and more broadly with other federal circuits) when it held that mere membership in and adherence to the rules of the Visa and MasterCard networks was sufficient to allege members engaged in an antitrust conspiracy. The cert petitions defined the question presented as: “Whether allegations that members of a business association agreed to adhere to the association's rules and possess governance rights in the association, without more, are sufficient to plead the element of conspiracy in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.”  Despite opposition from the consumers and from the independent ATM operators that had brought the underlying suits – which argued that the D.C. Circuit didn’t look only at membership in the Visa and MasterCard associations but at additional evidence of collusion as well – the justices agreed to take the cases to hear the question the credit card companies presented.  Between the cert grant on June 28 and the opening merits brief, Visa, MasterCard and the banks changed their counsel of record, bringing in Katyal of Hogan Lovells. The credit card companies and banks also changed their argument, though they didn’t say so. Instead of asserting that membership in a business association is not sufficient evidence of members participating in antitrust conspiracy, Katyal made the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2010 decision in American Needle v. National Football League the centerpiece of his merits brief. American Needle, you’ll recall, involved an antitrust challenge to NFL teams for granting apparel licenses as a group.  Though the NFL lost, the credit card companies’ merits brief asserted that the Supreme Court considered the teams a single entity – a sort of joint marketing venture. Each credit card company and its network of banks, the merits brief said, should be viewed not as horizontal competitors engaged in a conspiracy to fix ATM access fees but as a single network. “The D.C. Circuit thought respondents’ circumstantial allegations regarding the banks’ role in each network’s governance were enough” to let the case proceed, the brief said, citing American Needle. “But every joint venture involves cooperation between legally distinct entities, often with respect to how the venture will be run. And nothing in the complaints suggests the rules were the product of each network’s member banks’ ‘act[ing] on interests separate from those of’ their network.”  Now it’s important to remember that Visa and MasterCard are no longer membership associations – the subject of the question presented in the cert petition. But both still operate in networks with the banks that offer their cards. And both face big-dollar claims that they and their bank members collude on fees. If the Supreme Court were to agree with the Visa and MasterCard reframing of their networks’ activities in the ATM fee case, wrote Thomas Goldstein of Goldstein & Russell in a response brief for the independent ATM operators, “it is hard to see how competitors could ever be subject to suit under Section 1 for the activities of a joint venture.”  Goldstein’s brief pointed out that Visa and the other petitioners had not even mentioned American Needle or joint ventures when they asked the Supreme Court for review. Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, which represents the consumer respondents, said the same it its brief. So did the Justice Department in its filing in support of the respondents. All of the briefs urged the justices not to allow Visa and MasterCard to game the Supreme Court.  “Departing from this court’s settled practice of deciding only the Question Presented would be particularly improvident in this case,” Goldstein wrote. “The issue petitioners belatedly raise is central to an array of Section 1 claims against petitioners in other suits that have not yet been decided in the lower courts. Those cases involve a wide variety of restraints that have not even been described to this court, much less briefed in a manner that could permit a reasoned decision on such important matters. … Indeed, petitioners’ goal in pivoting their argument in this court so radically is almost certainly to secure such sweeping antitrust immunity, short-circuiting the other suits they now face.”  The justices gave Visa, MasterCard and their counsel a chance to respond, but in briefs filed earlier this week, Katyal mostly reargued the credit card companies’ position on antitrust and joint ventures, though he did point out that the consumer opposition to certiorari raised American Needle. The credit card companies’ joint venture assertions, the response brief said, fall squarely within the question that was presented in the cert petition.  Obviously, the justices disagreed, since they dismissed the cases the day after the response briefs were filed. The Supreme Court apparently had an open mind about whether to allow the credit card companies to expand their argument as recently as Nov. 14, when it granted the solicitor general’s office permission to participate in the scheduled Dec. 7 oral argument. It seems that the response briefs must have resolved any doubts, to the detriment of the credit card companies.",11192016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-otc-visa/scotus-dismissal-of-atm-fees-case-visa-mastercard-swung-for-a-home-run-called-out-on-strikes-idUSKBN13E03X
556,V,EU rules to stem payment fraud may disrupt six billion euros of e-commerce: Visa,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union’s planned rules to reduce fraud by forcing the use of passwords or codes to authenticate electronic payments above 10 euros ($10.60) risk disrupting online shopping and may not increase security, Visa said on Tuesday. As cybercrime and online fraud are on the rise, the European Banking Authority, the EU’s banking regulator, proposed in August draft technical standards to prevent illegal activities, including the passwords. “These new proposals threaten to seriously disrupt the way we all shop online,” Visa’s chief risk officer for Europe, Peter Bayley, said in a statement. “All of this inconvenience comes with no evidence that it will actually reduce fraud.” The world’s largest payments network operator said e-commerce may fall in Europe if the proposed rules where adopted, as consumers will be discouraged by the new technical hurdles while purchases outside the EU may be blocked. It said payments to vendors outside the EU amounting to more than 6 billion euros are at risk of being declined by network operators because foreign websites, based in the United States or Japan, may not apply the EU’s new security standards.  A survey conducted by Visa said that 51 percent of European consumers shop online from retailers outside the EU. Payments of more 10 euros with apps such as ride-hailing service Uber or on websites where consumers have registered their payment cards would also no longer be automatic, but will require verification codes.  Currently, payment services require authentication only when a shopper buys from vendors or from locations that are seen as suspicious because different from previous shopping patterns.  “The EBA had to make difficult trade-offs between various competing demands,” a spokeswoman for the regulator said. “These include the opposing objectives of achieving a high degree of security in retail payments against customer convenience.”  The banking authority will adopt a final proposal at the beginning of next year and is considering whether to introduce changes to its draft text, the spokeswoman told Reuters. The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, will have to confirm the proposed technical standards.

The S&P; 500 traded at levels it was six weeks ago, losing steam as investors focus on Trump’s priorities, such as restricting travel to the United States and rewriting trade deals. Markets had rallied following Trump’s Nov. 8 election win on the expectation that tax cuts, deregulation and a fiscal stimulus would accelerate economic growth. “The market had only priced in the potentially good type of policies like tax cuts,” said Arian Vojdani, investment strategist at MV Financial in Bethesda, Maryland. “Now we’re seeing potential protectionist and populist sentiment really come out and take the front seat. That could be bad for the world economy and that’s why markets are taking a step back.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 7.36 points, or 0.04 percent, to 19,883.58, the S&P; 500 gained 0.5 points, or 0.02 percent, to 2,280.05 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 8.51 points, or 0.15 percent, to 5,634.14. Trump reiterated his concerns about the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) deal and said he would like to speed up talks to either renegotiate or replace the deal. Investors are also wary of the consequences of other of Trump’s comments, including labeling a refugee swap agreement with staunch ally Australia as a “dumb deal” and that “nothing is off the table” in dealing with Iran after it test-fired a ballistic missile. Earnings of S&P; 500 companies are estimated to have risen 7.5 percent during the last quarter of 2016 - the most in nine quarters, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data.

Investors are also assessing possible consequences of Trump’s other comments, including labeling a refugee swap agreement with staunch ally Australia as a “dumb deal” and putting Iran “on notice” for firing a ballistic missile. U.S. equities had enjoyed a frenetic post-election rally on bets that Trump would usher in an era of growth, stimulating the economy through tax cuts, simpler regulations and higher infrastructure spending. However, the rally has been unraveling in the past weeks as Trump’s priorities, such as imposing restriction on travel to the United States and withdrawing from a trade deal, have caused uncertainty and made it hard for investors to have conviction in the equity market. “What you have is a tug-of-war between near-term positives in terms of economic data and earnings season juxtaposed against the confusion over what’s important in the first 100 days of the new administration and when will we get to see things like tax reforms,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Equity Capital Markets in New York.

The Fed, which left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, gave no firm signal of a hike in March as it closely watches the impact of President Donald Trump’s fiscal policies, adding another layer to the uncertainty triggered by his recent comments and decisions.

569,V,"UPDATE 2-Costco's same-store sales, profit miss estimates","(Reuters) - Warehouse club retailer Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) reported lower-than-expected quarterly comparable-store sales and profit as big grocery chains competed fiercely to attract customers with lower prices. The company’s shares fell about 4 percent to $170.80 in extended trading on Thursday. Price war in the industry has intensified, with Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) reportedly running a new price-comparison test to knock out competition from grocery chains and big-box retailers. The cut-throat competition has already hit supermarket operator Kroger Co (KR.N), which reported its first decline in quarterly comparable sales in 13 years on Thursday. Costco’s total same-store sales rose 3 percent in the second quarter ended Feb. 12, excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices and foreign exchange.  Analysts on average were expecting 3.2 percent growth, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. Costco said it would raise annual fees by $5 to $60 for Goldstar and business members and by $10 to $120 for executive memberships from June 1. The fee increases will impact around 35 million members, roughly half of them executive members, the company said. Membership fees accounted for about 72 percent of the Costco’s operating income in 2016, according to the company’s latest annual filing. Net income attributable to Costco fell to $515 million, or $1.17 per share, in the latest quarter from $546 million, or $1.24 per share, a year earlier.    Excluding items, Costco earned $1.17 per share, while total revenue rose 5.7 percent to $29.77 billion.  Analysts on average had estimated adjusted earnings of $1.36 per share and revenue of $29.86 billion in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Costco performed well in the last two quarters, despite a tough environment for retailers, as it partly benefited from paying lower fees to credit card partner Visa Inc (V.N). The company completed the switch to Visa from American Express Co (AXP.N) during the fourth quarter last year.

570,V,UPDATE 1-U.S. top court rejects bid to revive $7.25 billion credit card settlement,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear a bid by retailers to revive a $7.25 billion antitrust settlement they reached with Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc over claims the card networks improperly fixed credit and debit card fees. The high court left in place a 2016 lower court decision that threw out the settlement on the basis that it was unfair to retailers that stood to receive no payments and derive no other benefits. The brief Supreme Court order noted that Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito did not participate in consideration of whether to take up the appeal. No reason was given. The settlement had been intended to resolve claims that merchants were overcharged on interchange fees, or “swipe fees,” when shoppers used credit or debit cards, and were barred from directing customers toward cheaper means of payment. The deal had been the largest all-cash U.S. antitrust settlement, although its value shrank to about $5.7 billion after roughly 8,000 retailers “opted out.” The New York-based 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals found that the accord was unfair to retailers that stood to receive no payments and, in the court’s view, little or no benefit at all. It also decertified the case as a class action. The circuit court’s decision was a blow to the credit card industry, which hoped the settlement would end a decade of litigation brought on behalf of about 12 million retailers against Visa, MasterCard and banks that issue their cards. Companies including Amazon.com Inc, Costco Wholesale Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc opposed the settlement and challenged it on appeal. Card issuers American Express Co and Discover Financial Services also objected to the settlement. A federal judge in Brooklyn had approved the settlement in 2013, saying it offered significant damages and meaningful protections against future harm. Many retailers and trade groups objected. Some said the payout should have been higher while others said the settlement would have made it too difficult to sue Visa and MasterCard. According to the National Retail Federation trade group, retailers pay roughly $60 billion annually in swipe fees, which typically average around 2 percent. Card-issuing banks would have funded much of the settlement. JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp had estimated they were responsible for roughly one-fifth and one-tenth, respectively, of a payout.

572,V,Blockchain startup Chain teams with Thales to bolster security,"NEW YORK(Reuters) - U.S. blockchain startup Chain Inc has teamed with security firm Thales Group to make it easier for large companies that use blockchain technology to safely store their security credentials, the two companies said on Thursday. Adoption of blockchain technology, which is still in its early days, has been in part slowed down on concerns over security. A new service from Chain uses Thales’s hardware security modules (HSM) - highly secure processors designed to safeguard passwords and “digital keys” - to make it more attractive for large companies to adopt blockchain, the companies said in a joint statement.   The move follows the launch of a similar service by Accenture Plc  in February.  Blockchain, which first emerged as the system underpinning crypto-currency bitcoin, is a shared record of transactions that is maintained by a network of computers on the internet, instead of a centralized authority.  Large companies, which include exchange group Nasdaq Inc  and credit card company Visa Inc, have been ramping up their investments in blockchain in hopes that it can help reduce the cost and complexity of some of their most complex processes.  Information on the blockchain can only be edited by users that possess one-time cryptographic keys, which are normally stored in digital wallets. These have been hacked before, making them not sufficiently secure for use by large finance firms, which normally use HSMs.  Integration of Thales’ HSMs makes it easier for firms using Chain’s technology to meet their usual security standards when storing and generating keys, the companies said.  “As Chain takes blockchain networks to production, we’ve invested heavily in the secure generation and storage of private key material,” said Ryan Smith, chief technology officer at Chain. San Francisco-based Chain is one of the most established companies in the nascent blockchain industry.

574,V,UK consumer spending grows at slowest rate in three years: Visa,"LONDON (Reuters) - British consumer spending increased at the slowest annual pace in more than three years in the first three months of 2017, in a further sign that one of the economy’s main engines is losing steam as Brexit preparations begin, a survey showed on Monday. Payment card company Visa (V.N) said real-terms spending increased 0.9 percent year-on-year in the three months to March, the weakest calendar-quarter performance since late 2013 and down from 2.7 percent in the last quarter of 2016. In March alone, spending dropped 0.7 percent compared with the previous month, after being flat in February. The survey adds to a growing mass of indicators showing that rising inflation - caused in part by the pound’s post-Brexit vote tumble - is crimping consumer spending, just as Prime Minister Theresa May begins Britain’s EU divorce talks. “Our data suggests that consumer spending is beginning to slow from the strong levels seen in late 2016, as rising prices increasingly squeeze household purchasing power,” said Kevin Jenkins, UK and Ireland managing director at Visa. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, speaking at Thomson Reuters’ London office on Friday, said he would keep a close eye on whether consumer demand weakens in line with the central bank’s expectations. Last week pension provider Scottish Friendly and the Social Market Foundation think tank said 46 percent of households plan to cut back on spending. More than half of these households blamed the rising cost of living. The Office for National Statistics releases inflation data for March on Tuesday. Economists polled by Reuters expect consumer prices rose at a 2.3 percent annual pace, unchanged from February’s rate. Visa’s monthly figures are based on spending on its credit and debit cards, which it says account for about a third of consumer spending in Britain.  The figures are adjusted to strip out payments such as taxes that do not count as consumer spending, and to take account of the growing proportion of purchases made by card rather than with cash.

578,V,"Visa's profit boosted by Europe unit, big card portfolio wins","(Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N) on Thursday reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and said it expects full-year profit at the high end of its forecast, as it benefits from the purchase of Visa Europe and big credit-card portfolio wins back home. Shares of Visa, the world’s largest payments network operator, were up 2.5 percent at $93.45 in trading after the bell, after it also announced a $5 billion share buyback program. The company said total payments volume jumped 37.2 percent to $1.73 trillion in the second quarter ended March 31, on a constant dollar basis. San Francisco-based Visa, like rival MasterCard (MA.N) generates revenue by facilitating credit- and debit-card transactions. The growth in payments volume was helped by the addition to Visa’s results of Visa Europe, a former subsidiary Visa bought in June last year in a deal worth as much as $23 billion. Visa Europe made up nearly a fifth of total payments volume.     Payments volume in the United States, Visa’s biggest market, increased 11.7 percent on a constant dollar basis, helped both by major portfolio contracts as well as a stronger economy. Warehouse club retailer Costco (COST.O) and USAA, one of the largest U.S. issuers of credit and debit cards, switched their card portfolios to Visa last year, in a competitive environment where large portfolios are hotly sought-after by payment networks. A healthier U.S. economy, which has seen strong jobs growth and rising incomes in the first quarter of 2017, bodes well for consumer spending — a key economic indicator for payments processors like Visa. The trends, while boosting quarterly profit and revenue, also helped Visa update its full-year forecast. The company now expects adjusted profit at the high end of its forecast for a mid-teens percentage point increase. Visa also said it expects full-year revenue at the high end of its forecast for a 16-18 percent increase. Net income fell to $430 million or 18 cents per Class A share in the second quarter, from $1.71 billion or 71 cents per Class A share, a year earlier, reflecting a $1.5 billion one-time charge related to Visa Europe. Excluding one-time items, Visa earned 86 cents per Class A share, beating analysts’ average estimate of 79 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net operating revenue rose 23.5 percent to $4.48 billion. Analysts on average had expected $4.29 billion. Visa’s stock — a Dow component — had climbed 12.3 percent in the 12 months through Thursday.

587,V,UK consumer spending falls for first time in nearly 4 years: Visa,"LONDON (Reuters) - British consumers cut their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month, figures from credit card firm Visa showed, as households turned more cautious even before last week’s shock election result. Consumer spending in May was 0.8 percent lower than in the same month in 2016 after adjusting for inflation, the first year-on-year fall since September 2013, Visa said on Monday. Sales fell by a hefty 1.9 percent in monthly terms.     “Our index clearly shows that with rising prices and stalling wage growth, more of us are starting to feel the squeeze,” Visa managing director Kevin Jenkins said. Britain’s economy has shown signs that it is stagnating and confidence among businesses and consumers it expected to take a further hit after Prime Minister Theresa May failed to win a parliamentary majority in last week’s election.  She now plans to lead a minority government with support from Northern Ireland’s main unionist party, raising questions about how Britain will progress in Brexit talks and whether another election might be called soon. After shrugging off the initial impact of last year’s vote to leave the European Union, the effects of sterling’s more than 10 percent fall is catching up with Britons in the form of higher inflation, which is its strongest since September 2013. Sterling weakened again after last week’s inconclusive election result and businesses have said the election result risks paralyzing the government at a time when it is meant to be negotiating a smooth exit from the European Union. [nL8N1J631M] Retail sales in the first three months of 2017 suffered their biggest fall since 2010. Data published on Friday showed industrial output and construction faltered again in April. Britain’s overall economy was the weakest performer among the Group of Seven rich nations in the first quarter of 2017. Visa said bricks-and-mortar retailers suffered their biggest fall in sales in five years, which was only partly offset by strong growth in online sales. Growth in spending at hotels and restaurants - which has risen much faster than at retailers in recent quarters - slowed to an annual 3.3 percent. Spending on transport and clothing were the categories with the biggest falls. “The outlook for consumer spending continues to look relatively bleak, with households facing faster increases in living costs and muted wage growth,” said Annabel Fiddes, an economist at IHS Markit, which compiled the data for Visa. “The squeeze on household finances is likely to get worse as the Bank of England forecasts faster increases in consumer prices in the coming months,” she added. The Visa figures strip out seasonal and inflation effects, and are adjusted to take account of the growing share of spending on cards rather than cash.

Analysts at Morgan Stanley and Nordea Equity Research both said the U.S. giants could be interested in Scandinavia’s largest payments processor, which had a market capitalization of 26 billion crowns ($4 billion) at Friday’s close. “Nets can confirm that it has been approached and is reviewing its options. However, it is very early stage and there can be no certainty as to the potential outcome,” the company said in a statement on Saturday. Shares in Nets jumped as much as 14 percent on Monday following the statement which came after Bloomberg reported that potential buyers, including U.S. private equity firm Hellman & Friedman LLC, were interested.  “We believe interest from pure acquiring companies is less likely. The U.S. payment schemes (Visa & Mastercard) are clearly large enough to be able to acquire a company the size of Nets,” Morgan Stanley analysts write in a research note. Nordea Equity Research analyst Oliver Schüler Pisani said Visa and Mastercard could be potential bidders for Nets, the issuer of the most used debit card in Denmark, Dankort. Analysts said Nets’s valuation was attractive. It trades at a discount to both the sector and its closest rival, Worldplay WPG.L, leaving room for a good takeover premium, Pisani said. Nets trades at a 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 14.6 compared with 21.3 for Worldpay Group and 24.6 for Worldline (WLN.PA).

593,V,UPDATE 4-BNY Mellon names former Visa CEO to top job,"(Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) said on Monday former Visa Chief Executive Charles Scharf will take the top job at the world’s largest custody bank, where he will focus on boosting organic growth. Scharf immediately replaces as CEO 65-year-old Gerald Hassell, who will remain chairman of BNY Mellon until the end of the year when he retires. Scharf will then become chairman. “The first priority is growing the company organically,” Scharf told Reuters. “We already are in places that have tremendous amounts of opportunity.” BNY Mellon had $30.6 trillion in assets under custody and administration at the end of March. The bank’s massive platform is a key part of the plumbing that keeps global financial markets flowing. Besides safeguarding the stocks and bonds of large institutions, the bank calculates mutual fund prices, trades foreign currencies and facilitates securities lending to enable short selling by hedge funds, for example.  Scharf, who headed Visa from October 2012 to December 2016, played a key role in orchestrating the world’s largest payments network’s reunion with its European affiliate. “It looks to me they got the right guy,” said Daniel O’Keefe, who runs the $2.9 billion Artisan Global Value Fund (ARTGX.O). That fund owned about 2.1 million BNY Mellon shares at the end of June, or 3.7 percent of its net assets. BNY Mellon shares closed up 1.9 percent at $53.35. The stock rose about 145 percent during the last five years of Hassell's tenure, which began in late August 2011. The S&P; 500 Index .SPX is up 81 percent over the past five years. In recent years, O’Keefe and other large BNY Mellon investors, including Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners, pushed for change at the bank. Hassell felt the brunt of the heat, getting support and a rebuke from Trian partner and chief investment officer Ed Garden at the bank’s 2015 annual meeting.  Still, O’Keefe said Scharf will run a company that is in a good position.  “Visa is a platform and a systems business, one of the best in the world,” O’Keefe said. “BNY is also effectively a systems and platform business. Its future lies in optimizing those systems and driving out costs.” Scharf and Hassell, during an interview with Reuters, agreed that the bank’s ability to wring out costs and keep up with the pace of change in technology will be a key part of its future. On a conference call BNY Mellon held on Monday afternoon with financial analysts, two asked about the timing of the executive change, which one called “a little abrupt.” Joseph Echevarria, the bank’s lead director, said the company has been engaged in the CEO succession process for “a couple of years” and looked at internal and external candidates.  Once the bank settled on Scharf, Hassell said, the goal was to show he was CEO from his first day on the job. “There’s nothing really sudden about it,” Hassell said.

Its future lies in optimizing those systems and driving out costs.” Scharf and Hassell, during an interview with Reuters, agreed that the bank’s ability to wring out costs and keep up with the pace of change in technology will be a key part of its future. On a conference call BNY Mellon held on Monday afternoon with financial analysts, two asked about the timing of the executive change, which one called “a little abrupt.” Joseph Echevarria, the bank’s lead director, said the company has been engaged in the CEO succession process for “a couple of years” and looked at internal and external candidates.  Once the bank settled on Scharf, Hassell said, the goal was to show he was CEO from his first day on the job. “There’s nothing really sudden about it,” Hassell said.

608,V,UK consumer spending sees longest decline since 2013: Visa,"LONDON (Reuters) - British consumer spending fell for the third month in a row in July in its longest losing streak in over four years, according to data released on Monday, in another sign that the impact of last year’s Brexit vote is rippling through to households. Overall consumer spending, the engine of the British economy, dropped by 0.8 percent in real terms last month compared with July 2016, payments company Visa said. That was quicker than June’s 0.2 percent fall, and following a further drop in May it marks the longest consecutive decline since February 2013, when a still-frail economy was struggling to recover from the financial crisis.  “The figure provides further evidence that rising prices and stagnant wage growth are squeezing consumers’ pockets,” said Kevin Jenkins, Visa’s managing director for the United Kingdom and Ireland. Last week the Bank of England downgraded its forecast for economic growth this year and next, due partly to slower-than-expected wage rises, and it sees a weaker outlook for household spending than for other sectors of the economy. Visa’s data chimed with other signs that households are under financial pressure - from lackluster retail sales to falling new car registrations and mortgage approvals. A fall in the value of sterling since the Brexit vote in June last year has stoked inflation at a time when wage growth is slowing, squeezing incomes. Consumer confidence dropped to a one-year low in July, according to market research firm GfK. Spending on transport and communications and on clothing and footwear took the biggest knocks, down by 6.1 percent and 5.2 percent respectively.  The fall in sales of clothing - a sector especially reliant on imports - was the second-biggest in five years, after an even larger drop in May. Clothing sales had enjoyed a boost early in July due to better-than-usual summer weather, a survey from the Confederation of British Industry showed, but since then both the weather and the picture from other retail measures has been gloomier. Visa pointed to continued strength in spending on hotels, restaurants and bars, as sterling’s weakness deterred Britons from going abroad.  “The sector is likely to have benefited from an early surge in summer staycations, as the weak pound made holidaying at home more attractive,” Jenkins said.

609,V,UPDATE 1-Fintech firm Fiserv raises offer for Monitise to $98 mln,"(Reuters) - U.S. financial technology provider Fiserv made an improved offer for Monitise worth about 75 million pounds ($98 million) on Monday, hoping to secure backing from the British financial services technology group’s investors. Fiserv’s earlier offer, which valued the group at about 70 million pounds, drew criticism from Monitise’s investors led by Cavendish Asset Management, for being too low, given that the British group was worth over 1 billion pounds three year ago. Fiserv’s final offer of 3.1 pence in cash per share represents a premium of 34.8 percent over Monitise’s closing price on June 12, the last before the initial offer was made. Monitise said its directors unanimously recommended the increased and final offer, which is higher than the original 2.9 pence per share bid. Fiserv urged shareholders to accept the offer, pointing to the fact that Monitise’s board had stated that they would need to consider raising further capital and divestment of the business, were the deal to fall through. The values of payments firms have surged and mergers and acquisitions have proliferated in the sector as shoppers switch from cash to paying for purchases by smartphones or other mobile devices. AIM-listed Monitise blazed a trail by linking banks and mobile operators to build a business capable of handling billions of dollars in mobile payments, purchases and money transfers. But it has faced increased competition from free mobile payment systems offered by the likes of Alphabet Inc and Apple Inc.  Banco Santander, Monitise’s top shareholder with a 4.67 percent stake, had submitted a letter of intent to back the deal, as had Visa Inc, a large customer and investor with a 2.41 percent stake.      This alongside Monitise directors’ shares, meant that Fiserv had letters of intent or irrevocable undertakings for 229.6 million shares, representing 9.9 percent of Monitise’s existing issued share capital. Cavendish did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

620,V,American Express wins dismissal of lawsuit over lost Costco contract,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - American Express Co (AXP.N) has won the dismissal of a lawsuit accusing the credit card services company of defrauding shareholders about the loss in 2015 of a lucrative co-branding relationship with Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O). In a decision made public on Monday, U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe in Manhattan rejected claims that American Express improperly downplayed the risk its 16-year relationship with Costco might end, and concealed how the warehouse chain had generated 8 percent of its revenue and 20 percent of its loans. While the proposed class-action complaint alleged that Costco might have viewed American Express as “just another vendor” that could be shunted aside for a “cheaper” rival, the judge said American Express merely viewed such statements as evidence that Costco would “drive a hard bargain,” not walk away. The plaintiffs were led by the Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 137 Pension Fund in Springfield, Illinois. Its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. American Express spokeswoman Marina Norville said the New York-based company was pleased with the decision, which was dated Sept. 30. The judge said the plaintiffs may amend their complaint. The market value of American Express fell by roughly $8 billion in the two days after the company, whose largest shareholder is Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), disclosed the loss of the Costco contract, which moved to Visa Inc (V.N). American Express has long traditionally focused on affluent customers who often pay bills on time, but has been encouraging some cardholders to borrow more and earn more rewards. This summer, American Express announced a plan to let cardholders pay off purchases of $100 or more in installments, which could result in more fees. American Express shares closed Monday up 8 cents at $90.54, roughly 6 percent below their all-time high set in 2014.

621,V,"UK consumer spending spikes up in September, but trend gloomy: Visa"," (This October 8 story has been corrected to show survey was published on Monday, not Friday) LONDON (Reuters) - British consumer spending jumped in September, but not by enough to halt a year-on-year decline that reflects rising living costs, a survey by payments company Visa showed on Monday. Consumer spending - adjusted for inflation and seasonal effects - rose by 1.4 percent in September after falling 0.4 percent month on month in August, Visa said, based on its credit and debit card data. This was the biggest monthly rise since November, but still left overall spending in real terms 0.3 percent below its level a year ago. Spending has fallen year-on-year for four of the past five months, the longest series of such declines since April 2013. “Rising living costs, muted wage growth, and ongoing uncertainties surrounding Brexit negotiations and the strength of the UK economy continue to act as drags on household spending,” said Annabel Fiddes, an economist at financial data company IHS Markit, which compiled the data for Visa. The upbeat tone in September month-on-month data echoed that in figures from the Confederation of British Industry, which reported the biggest annual increase in retail sales in two years in the early part of the month. But Fiddes said overall expenditure remained on track for its weakest performance in four years. The Bank of England is looking to see if consumer spending will recover from its weakness in the first half of the year as it prepares to raise interest rates for the first time in more than a decade. Official data showed household spending rose 1.6 percent year-on-year in the three months to June.

624,V,"UPDATE 3-PayPal tops profit estimates, lifts target on mobile payments growth","(Reuters) - Sharp growth in mobile payments led PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O) to report a better-than-expected third-quarter profit on Thursday and lift its guidance for earnings through the rest of the year. The San Jose, California-based payments company has been working hard in recent years to expand its reach to new customers through partnerships and acquisitions, particularly in mobile payments. Those deals are clearly starting to bear fruit, analysts said. “It was just a very strong quarter across the board,” said A.B. Mendez, an analyst and fund manager at Frost Investment Advisors. PayPal shares were up 3.9 percent at $69.89 in after-hours trading following the results. Since separating from online marketplace eBay Inc (EBAY.O) in 2015, PayPal has reshaped itself from a company that mostly processed transactions for its parent to a payments giant that handles money transfers between other companies and customers, as well as friends, roommates, overseas relatives and small businesses. It has partnered with household names like Mastercard Inc (MA.N), Visa Inc (V.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Alphabet Inc’s (GOOG.O) Google, Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT.O) Skype, and acquired startups like online lender Swift Financial and remittances company Xoom. It also owns Venmo, the mobile payments app that is popular with young adults, and still handles transactions for eBay. In a call with analysts, Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman characterized the third quarter as possibly the best since its split from eBay and said PayPal is on the hunt for more acquisitions. “We have very strong balance sheet, and it’s a potential weapon for us as we think about competing going forward,” he said. The company’s adjusted profit rose 32 percent during the third quarter to $560 million, or 46 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 43 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 21.4 percent to $3.24 billion. PayPal lifted its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to a range of $1.86 to $1.88 per share from $1.80 per share to $1.84 per share. It expects 50 cents to 52 cents per share in earnings during the fourth quarter, compared with an average analyst estimate of 51 cents. Much of the gains have come from PayPal’s aggressive effort to pick up market share in the fast-growing mobile payments space. Its mobile payments volume jumped 54 percent during the third quarter compared with the year-ago period, to about $40 billion. Total payments volume rose 31 percent to $114 billion. Venmo, which allows individuals in the United States to send each other money through a mobile app, more than doubled its payments volumes. Earlier this week, PayPal said it would soon allow more than 2 million merchant customers to start accepting payments through the platform.

626,V,"Visa's profit beats on higher card swipes, stock at record","(Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N) beat Wall Street’s quarterly profit expectations on Wednesday helped by more people using its world-wide network to pay for everything from groceries to Uber rides, sending its shares to a record. Visa has seen an uptick of card payments in the U.S. as consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, remains at a healthy clip. The company’s U.S. market share for card payments has climbed steadily as consumers switch from cash and checks. Visa has been tapping into the U.S. market aggressively, offering incentives to use to cards instead of cash on everyday purchases. It recently partnered with Uber that lets riders, whose Uber account is linked to a Visa card, earn ride credits for buying goods at participating merchants. Shares of Visa, a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, rose as much as 2 percent to a record of $110.61. In the latest quarter, the world’s largest payments network operator saw payment volumes rise 9.8 percent to $1.93 trillion, on a constant dollar basis, with the United States accounting for about 43 percent of the total. It expects payment volume growth of high-single digits in 2018, on a constant dollar basis.  The company is also making progress with integrating its $23 billion Visa Europe acquisition last year. “Visa ended our fiscal year as we began, with strong growth across payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions, which was bolstered by the addition of Visa Europe,” Chief Executive Alfred Kelly Jr said. Earnings rose 11 percent to $2.14 billion in the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30. Earnings per Class A share rose to 90 cents and beat analysts’ estimates of 85 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Visa has topped estimates for eight straight quarters.    Operating expenses rose marginally to $1.64 billion from severance costs related to Visa Europe. Visa expects adjusted operating expenses to be in the mid-single-digit range in 2018. Total operating revenue rose 14 percent to $4.86 billion, beating estimates for the fifth straight quarter. bit.ly/2z5EEeA Visa expects revenue growth of high-single digits in 2018, on a nominal dollar basis. “Overall we see trends as sound, and while some may see net revenue guidance as light, we see another year of strong growth,” Barclays said in a note.

641,V,EBay investors cheer move to ditch PayPal as main payments partner,"(Reuters) - Shares of eBay (EBAY.O) hit an all-time high on Thursday after the e-commerce platform unveiled a plan to take more control of customer payments from long-standing partner PayPal, a move analysts said would help it compete better with Amazon. Dutch fintech company Adyen will become eBay’s primary payments processor under the plan, which seeks to have more transactions conducted directly on eBay’s sites. Analysts said that might bring in more revenue for eBay while lowering costs, adding to optimism from a strong holiday quarter for the e-commerce company. “Moving away from PayPal (PYPL.O), lowering the costs of selling products on the marketplace makes eBay a more significant competitor because it lowers the relative cost versus others including Amazon (AMZN.O),” said D.A. Davidson & Co’s analyst Tom Forte. EBay is adapting to the likes of online crafts retailer Etsy Inc’s (ETSY.O) model by taking control of the payment process on its marketplaces from PayPal, Forte added. “But to be clear, there will always be a place for PayPal on eBay — it just will be less prominent,” said Forte. Some analysts said they were surprised by eBay’s estimate of the benefits from taking payments intermediary service in-house. The company said it would add $500 million to operating profit after the PayPal deal expires in mid-2020. Transactions through eBay account for roughly 13 percent of total payments processed by PayPal, whose shares sank more than 8 percent in response on Thursday. PayPal might be able to fill the hole created by eBay thanks to its strong growth rate, although that is not certain at this point, BTIG analyst Mark Palmer said. EBay’s backing for Adyen could turn the smaller payment processor into a “much more robust competitor” to PayPal over time, Palmer added. Other analysts, however, said PayPal, which has been eBay’s preferred provider for the past 15 years and will remain a payment page option on the platform for the foreseeable future, had the scale to ride out the blow. “Over time, given the recent agreements with Visa (V.N) and MasterCard (MA.N), PayPal will be able to scale and expand margins,” Wedbush Securities analysts said in a client note. At least 13 Wall Street analysts raised their price targets on eBay’s shares. EBay’s stock climbed 15 percent on Thursday, recording its biggest one-day gain since 1998, the year of its market debut.

647,V,Visa to defend tourists' card fees at EU antitrust hearing,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Visa (V.N) will on Tuesday try to fend off European Union  antitrust charges that it subjects foreign tourists to excessive fees when they use their cards in the EU, people familiar with the matter said. The world’s largest payments network operator will present its case before senior European Commission officials and national competition officials at a two-day closed hearing, six months after charges were filed against the company. An adverse ruling could leave Visa subject to a hefty fine. The EU competition enforcer said in August last year that fees charged to retailers when they accept Visa cards issued outside the EU could raise prices for consumer goods and services. Such fees have long been a sore point with retailers, who see it as a hidden cost for consumers. The case is important for the EU, which wants to trim such costs and improve cross-border trade. “We welcome the opportunity to meet with the European Commission to outline our position regarding inter-regional interchange fees,” Visa spokesman Richard Braham said. “Visa firmly believes that payment card transactions by international tourists are an important contributor to European economies.” The Commission declined to comment. Visa could face fines of up to 10 percent of its global turnover if found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules. MasterCard (MA.N), which will also attend Tuesday’s hearing,  faces similar charges by the Commission, and it has warned it might be subject to a fine in excess of $1 billion. In July 2015, the Commission accused MasterCard of levying excessive fees on non-EU issued cards used in the bloc. It also charged that MasterCard rules prevented banks in one EU country from offering lower interchange fees to a retailer in a second EU country where interchange fees may be higher. To end another EU investigation, Visa and MasterCard have capped cross-border fees within Europe - that is, fees on transactions in one EU country charged for transactions in another EU country. Business lobbying group EuroCommerce, whose members include Swedish retailer Ikea [IKEA.UL], French supermarket chain Carrefour (CARR.PA) and Spanish clothing retailer Inditex, will also take part in the event.

648,V,UK consumers cut spending as snow adds to inflation squeeze: Visa,"LONDON (Reuters) - British consumers cut their spending by the most in more than five years in early 2018 as heavy snowfalls combined with an ongoing squeeze on household budgets to hit retailers, payments company Visa said on Monday. Visa said inflation-adjusted consumer spending in the three month to the end of March was 1.4 percent lower than a year earlier - the biggest fall since the fourth quarter of 2012 - after a 1.3 percent fall in the fourth quarter of 2017. Spending in March alone fell by the most since October, down 2.1 percent on the year after a 1.0 percent fall in February. Visa said the weakness in consumer spending reflected a dip in confidence among many households as well as unusually snowy weather. “That said, it is too early to read a great deal into this year-on-year decline, which should be viewed in the context of high growth rates in early 2017,” Mark Antipof, chief commercial officer at Visa, said. Online sales fell for the first time in 10 months. Last month online supermarket Ocado (OCDO.L) reported that its sales suffered after snow storms disrupted its deliveries. Britain’s overall economy appears to have slowed in early 2018 as the snow added to uncertainty about the country’s departure from the European Union next year. Visa said only spending on food and in hotels, restaurants and bars rose in March, probably due in part to the early Easter holiday weekend. Official retail sales figures, due on Thursday, are also expected to show a fall in spending in March. Figures published by the British Retail Consortium on Monday showed a 6 percent fall in the number of people visiting retailers, the biggest annual drop since the end of 2010, reflecting the bad weather. For more than a year, British consumers have been hit by a double-whammy of slow wage growth and a jump in inflation caused largely by the pound’s plunge after the 2016 Brexit vote. But there are signs that the worst of the squeeze has passed. Official figures due this week are expected to show the strongest wage growth in nearly two-and-a-half years at 3.0 percent in the three months to February, while inflation is forecast to have held at 2.7 percent, according to a Reuters poll of economists. That would represent the first time that wages have grown more strongly than inflation since March of last year. The Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates next month for only the second time since the start of the global financial crisis more than 10 years ago, due in large part to signs that wage growth is picking up. Visa’s data is based on spending on its debit, credit and prepaid cards, which account for about a third of consumer spending. The growth rates are adjusted for inflation, seasonal effects and differences between typical card and cash spending.

651,V,"UPDATE 3-Visa tops profit estimates, raises full-year earnings forecast","(Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N) topped Wall Street targets for quarterly profit and raised its full-year earnings forecast on Wednesday, as more people use credit cards worldwide to buy everything from gas to online goods. The world’s largest payments network, like its smaller rival Mastercard Inc (MA.N), gets most of its revenue through transaction fees, which are earned every time a customer swipes their credit or debit card on the company’s network. Visa has seen card payments grow thanks to higher U.S. consumer spending and rising oil prices. Higher gas prices translate to a higher dollar volume in transaction fees for Visa. The company said payment volumes rose 11 percent to $1.99 trillion on a constant dollar basis for the second quarter, with the United States accounting for about 43 percent of the total amount. Cross-border volumes – the value of transactions made outside the United States – rose 11 percent on constant dollar basis. Visa’s shares rose 2.7 percent to $124.52 in after-hours trading on Wednesday. The company now expects full-year adjusted earnings to grow at the high end of a mid-20s percentage digit forecast. Visa expects double-digit expense growth in the third quarter, due to personnel costs, increased investments and the upcoming FIFA World Cup in Russia, in which the company is an official payment services partner. Total operating expenses in the second quarter rose 4 percent to $1.74 billion.  Its net operating revenue rose 13 percent to $5.07 billion in the quarter ended March 31. Net income rose to $2.61 billion from $430 million a year earlier. Earnings per Class A share rose to $1.11 from 18 cents a year earlier.
