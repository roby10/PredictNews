1,VZ,Internet providers to act against online pirates,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Consumers who illegally download copyrighted films, music or television shows might see their Internet speed slowed or access restricted under an industry anti-piracy effort announced on Thursday.  U.S. Internet service providers, including Verizon Communications Inc, Comcast Corp, Time Warner Cable Inc, Cablevision Systems Corp and AT&T Inc agreed to alert customers, up to six times, when it appears their account is used for illegal downloading. Warnings will come as e-mails or pop-up messages.  If suspected illegal activity persists, the provider might temporarily slow Internet speed or redirect the browser to a specific Web page until the customer contacts the company. The user can seek an independent review of whether they acted legally.  Internet access will not be terminated, according to a statement from the industry partners behind the effort. The coalition includes groups representing movie studios, independent film makers and record labels.  The group argues that content piracy costs the U.S. economy more than 373,000 jobs, $16 billion in lost earnings and $3 billion in tax revenue each year.  Industry officials said they thought most people would stop copyright violations once they were warned about illegal activity. The warnings also might alert parents unaware of their children’s activity.  “We are confident that, once informed that content theft is taking place on their accounts, the great majority of broadband subscribers will take steps to stop it,” James Assey, executive vice president of the National Cable & Telecommunications Association, said in a statement.  Two consumer groups said the effort had the “potential to be an important educational vehicle” to help reduce online copyright infringement, but voiced concern about the sanctions.  “We are particularly disappointed that the agreement lists Internet account suspension among the possible remedies,” the Center for Democracy & Technology and Public Knowledge said in a statement.  The groups said it would be “wrong for any (Internet service provider) to cut off subscribers, even temporarily, based on allegations that have not been tested in court.”  The Obama administration welcomed the industry effort.  “We believe it will have a significant impact on reducing online piracy,” Victoria Espinel, the U.S. intellectual property enforcement coordinator, wrote on the White House blog.  The administration expects the organization that implements the program to consult with advocacy groups “to assure that its practices are fully consistent with the democratic values that have helped the Internet to flourish,” she added.

3,VZ,Varney to step down as top antitrust official,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Christine Varney, the top antitrust official in the U.S. Justice Department, is stepping down, the department said on Wednesday.  She will join elite law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore, the firm said in an internal memo on Wednesday. She will be leaving the Justice Department as of August 5, the department said.  Varney’s decision comes as the division is looking at AT&T Inc’s $39 billion plan to buy T-Mobile USA. The deal, which requires Federal Communications Commission and Justice Department approval, would concentrate 80 percent of U.S. wireless contract customers in just two companies — AT&T/T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless.  There was no immediate word on a successor, but none of the antitrust experts interviewed expected Varney’s successor to be someone whose decision making would be sharply different.  “The policies of the division are less influenced by who occupies that chair than some people might think, and more by who is doing the picking. Since the same individuals may be picking the successor, I do not anticipate that there will be a major shift,” said Stephen Axinn, of law firm Axinn Veltrop and Harkrider LLP.  Varney was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2009 to beef up antitrust enforcement, which critics saw as too quick to approve mergers under President George W. Bush.  But Varney did not turn out to be the hard-nosed enforcer many had hoped.  Her division’s willingness to agree to remedies such as requiring a firewall to protect rivals’ key data in the Ticketmaster case was a departure from an earlier preference for divestitures in cases when a merger would have led to monopoly.  But Varney did step in and threaten to sue NASDAQ OMX Group and IntercontinentalExchange Inc if they proceeded with a bid to buy NYSE Euronext. The deal was scuttled in May.  During her two years on the job, Varney approved Comcast’s acquisition of a 51 percent stake in NBC Universal from General Electric Co, creating a $30 billion business that includes broadcast, cable networks, movie studios and theme parks. The mammoth deal included the condition that Comcast give up day-to-day control of video website Hulu.  The Justice Department under Varney also extended controversial approvals of Ticketmaster’s buy of Live Nation in 2010 and Google’s buy of ticketing software company ITA in April.  “In each case, the remedy is impossible to evaluate at this point in time,” said Bert Foer, head of the American Antitrust Institute and a skeptic of behavioral remedies.  Foer, however, gave Varney credit for reinvigorating the agency and pressing on with criminal enforcement such as price fixing cases that tend not to change from administration to administration. “I would probably give her about a B-minus grade,” he said.  Prior to becoming assistant attorney general for the Antitrust Division, Varney was at Hogan & Hartson, now Hogan Lovells. She was previously a commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission.  Cravath, a law firm with about 500 attorneys, has a renowned antitrust practice. It represented United Airlines in its merger with Continental, which was completed in October. The firm also has represented IBM and Time Warner Cable for years. The law firm’s average profits per partner in 2010 were $3.2 million, according to The American Lawyer. Gross revenue was $591 million.  ",7072011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-antitrust/varney-to-step-down-as-top-antitrust-official-idUSTRE7656VS20110707

6,VZ,Courts OK Nortel patent sale to Apple/RIM group,"WILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) - Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp, Research in Motion Ltd and three other leading tech companies received court approval on Monday to buy wireless patents from bankrupt Nortel Networks Corp for $4.5 billion.  Judges in the United States and Canada approved the sale of 6,000 patents and applications, which fetched three times what some analysts expected from the four-day auction in June.  Nortel Networks Corp filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors in January 2009 and courts in the two countries are overseeing the disposal of the company’s assets as the former telecommunications giant winds down its operations.  The group of six that won the auction, a collection that bid as Rockstar Bidco LP, also included EMC Corp, Ericsson and Sony Corp.  The auction was “record breaking in terms of this case and in the patent industry generally,” Lisa Schweitzer of Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, which represents Nortel, told a Delaware Bankruptcy Court hearing.  The auction started with a “stalking horse” bid of $900 million by Google Inc, a company with a relatively small pool of wireless patents in a booming industry increasingly fraught with lawsuits over intellectual property.  The price paid after 19 rounds of bidding indicated the lengths the Apple group was willing to go to thwart the mobile ambitions of Google, according to analysts.  The winning group would likely try to maximize their return on the patents by using them to litigate against others, with Google and its Android mobile phone software first on the list, analysts said.  Also bidding were Intel Corp and RPX Corp, which licenses patents to clients for a fee. Apple initially bid on its own, but partnered with the Rockstar group after round five.  The sale spans wireless, data networking, optical, voice, Internet and semiconductor technologies. The most prized relate to emerging 4G standards such as long-term evolution (LTE).  Several large technology companies such as Verizon Communications Inc and Hewlett-Packard Co objected to the sale. Most objections were resolved by reiterating the sale did not negate licensing agreements involving the patents included in the sale.  Delaware bankruptcy judge Kevin Gross said it would be a “$4.5 billion mistake” not to approve the sale.  The money will become part of the Nortel estate and will eventually be distributed to creditors that range from suppliers to investors holding the company’s bonds.  “This is truly a ‘wow’ transaction,” said David Botter of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer Feld LLP, which represents the official committee of creditors.  The transaction is expected to close in about a month, according to Schweitzer.  The Rockstar group got antitrust clearance on June 23 for the transaction. However, the American Antitrust Institute has asked the Justice Department for “an in-depth investigation” into the consortium’s patent portfolio purchase.  This sale fetched a higher price than all of Nortel’s other asset sales combined. Nortel has now raised almost $8 billion from asset sales.  The July 1 announcement of the auction outcome pushed some of Nortel’s bonds above par, indicating traders are speculating the money from the sale could lead to certain bonds being paid in full.  The hearing was held simultaneously by way of a telecast with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, where it was approved by Judge Geoffrey Morawetz. Nortel is based in Mississauga, Ontario.

8,VZ,Regulators combat unauthorized phone bill fees,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Telephone companies would have to make third-party charges on landline phone bills clear and distinct to help people detect unauthorized fees under rules proposed on Tuesday by communications regulators.  The Federal Communications Commission unanimously proposed rules to against so-called mystery fees and “cramming,” the illegal placement of extra charges on phone bills.  Cramming may affect up to 20 million Americans, the FCC estimates, with only one person in 20 realizing that they are being charged for unwanted services.  “We’re sending a clear message: if you charge consumers for something they didn’t request, you’ll be discovered and you’ll be punished,” FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski said.  The FCC’s proposal would require landline phone companies to tell people about any blocking services they offer and denote charges from third parties in a separate section of the bill from the telephone company’s charges.  The rules also would require the FCC’s contact information to appear on all landline and wireless phone companies’ bills and websites with a notice that customers can file complaints with the agency.  Cramming generally adds anywhere from $1.99 to $19.99 a month to a phone bill. The charges can originate from the phone companies or from third parties for services such as horoscopes, yoga lessons and diet plans.  Cramming also is an emerging concern for wireless carriers, and the FCC’s proposal seeks comment on whether the rules should apply to wireless companies too.  Genachowski said that the proposal minimizes the compliance burdens on carriers.  The FCC has also asked whether phone companies like AT&T Inc (T.N), Verizon Communications (VZ.N) and Qwest Communications should be subject to further requirements such as making them provide and ensure the accuracy of contact information of third-party vendors and a ban on extra charges for blocking services.  The FCC Enforcement Bureau as part of its work against unauthorized charges, found that Main Street Telephone, VoiceNet Telephone LLC, Cheap2Digital Telephone LLC and Norristown Telephone LLC appear to have overcharged consumers about $8 million, and last month proposed $11.7 million in penalties against the four companies.  Verizon Wireless (VZ.N) (VOD.L), the top U.S. mobile service, agreed to a $25 million settlement last October on top of refunding consumers more than $50 million for charging mystery fees after a 10-month FCC investigation.  States, the Federal Trade Commission and lawmakers have also targeted cramming and are looking to crack down on unauthorized fees. The Senate Commerce Committee will hold a hearing on Wednesday on its yearlong investigation into cramming and its impact on consumers.

11,VZ,"As copper soars, thieves extract a price","NEW YORK (Reuters) - When thieves ransacked eight air conditioners in an apartment complex in the city of Mobile, Alabama, the culprits made off with $800 worth of scrap metal and left residents with $38,000 worth of damages.  “We’ve had copper robberies since forever,” said Officer Christopher Levy of the Mobile Police Department, “but we’ve seen a spike so far this summer.”  Record copper prices have caused a surge in U.S. copper thefts, plaguing law enforcement and local governments and prompting states to pass new laws.  “Since the beginning of the 2004 spike in copper prices, copper theft and copper prices have been directly linked,” a 2010 U.S. Department of Energy study on copper wire thefts said.  The price of the red metal traded in New York rallied to its highest in nearly three months during the first week of July, placing it within 5 percent of its all-time high of $465 per pound in mid-February this year. Even at roughly $439 on Wednesday morning, the price was still right for thieves.  Copper’s historic price rise this year has been powered by strong global demand from China, which accounted for about 40 percent of this year’s 21 million metric tons of global consumption. Prices have also been driven up by a widely expected supply shortfall for the rest of this year into 2012.  With these prices, thievery of the metal is not just a U.S. problem: copper thefts increased 85 percent in London last year according to New Scotland Yard. France has suffered from a similar problem with the number of thefts rising 123 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2010, according to police figures.  Copper, valued because it is an excellent conductor of electricity, works for almost all types of wiring and is used by most utilities, giving thieves plenty of targets. Wired lines and substations are especially popular theft zones, often cutting off electricity or telephone access and running up millions of dollars in damage.  Michigan utility company DTE Energy (DTE.N) reported thefts costing the company $10 million in 2007. Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PCG.N) was spending more than $1 million per year in damages, the Department of Energy reported.  “You can get a few thousand to tens of thousands worth of damage” in any one incident, Verizon Communications (VZ.N) spokesman Lee Gierczynski said.  Thieves also have stripped copper and other materials from houses left vacant by the rash of mortgage foreclosures across much of the country.  Some states have passed laws to stem copper thefts in recent years, after the Copper Theft Prevention Act failed to reach the floor for a vote in the U.S. Congress in 2008. At least 33 states have copper theft laws, South Carolina being the most recent after passing its law in late June.  “This was a huge communitywide problem,” Minority Leader Harry L. Ott Jr. of the South Carolina House of Representatives said of the law that takes effect in August. His own district had suffered from irrigation and air-conditioning damages.  The new law prohibits recyclers from paying cash for copper, with the aim to make copper less attractive to drug addicts trying to make a quick dollar.  “We wanted to take the incentive to steal out of the equation,” Ott said.

18,VZ,Sweden raids local Nasdaq bourse in competition probe,"STOCKHOLM, July 14 - Swedish regulators have raided U.S.-owned bourse operator Nasdaq OMX Group in a competition probe likely to raise questions over exchanges’ efforts to woo controversial high-frequency traders.  The raid, carried out last month, was prompted by a complaint by new Nordic marketplace Burgundy.  Burgundy said it was denied space for its computers alongside those of clients, such as banks, in a data center owned by U.S. telecoms company Verizon.  That put it at a disadvantage to larger rival Nasdaq OMX, Burgundy said, which had got space in the data center near clients enabling the exchange to execute super-fast trades.  Physical closeness of a trader’s computers to those of a stock exchange — a practice known as co-location — can shave fractions of seconds off client orders, giving the super-fast trader an edge over those that are further away.  “It was only a matter of time before the regulators began to look at how people have access to markets in terms of co-location because how close you are to the box can make a vital difference,” said Herbie Skeete, managing director at exchange consultants Mondo Visione.  Established stock exchanges, under pressure from alternative venues such as Burgundy, are increasingly relying on the revenues and liquidity provided by hedge funds and proprietary firms that use algorithms to execute lightning-fast trades.  Burgundy Chief Executive Olof Neiglick told Reuters his company had agreed in 2010 to house its servers in the Verizon center, but the U.S. firm later canceled the deal and it had to move to a location 5 kilometers away.  Nasdaq OMX and Verizon said on Thursday they were cooperating with authorities.  Court documents showed the Swedish competition authority had been authorized to raid both Nasdaq and Verizon’s Swedish business. A spokeswoman for the regulator confirmed a raid had taken place.  The court documents said KKV, the competition authority, wanted to investigate whether OMX had applied pressure on Verizon or threatened to punish Verizon if the telecoms company made an agreement with one of its competitors.  “According to the KKV, OMX and Verizon’s actions mean that Burgundy risks being shut of the market in bourse trade with Nordic securities,” the document said, adding there was reason to believe that “OMX’s actions amount to a violation of rules on abuse of a dominant position.”  The competition authority was allowed to look for evidence such as e-mails, notes, letters, faxes and meeting minutes.  Competition between exchanges has become intense, with this year seeing a flurry of cross-border deal attempts by bourses eager to cut costs and diversify in the face of fast-eroding market shares in their traditional businesses.  Burgundy was launched in 2009 by its owners, a consortium of Nordic banks and brokers, to pressure OMX to keep trading fees low. Larger so-called multi-lateral trading facilities (MTFs) such as BATS and Chi-X also compete in Europe.  Mondo Visione’s Skeete said other smaller players were also likely to challenge the practices of their bigger rivals.  “If you are a small player ... and you think the incumbent is not making it easy for you then you are going to look at any angle you can to level the playing field,” he said.  Burgundy’s average daily turnover in June was 147 million euros for a total monthly trade of just over 3 billion euros, while equity trading on Nasdaq OMX’s Nordic market in June, including over-the-counter business, came to 50.9 billion euros for average daily turnover of 2.6 billion euros.  The Vienna Stock Exchange told Reuters on Wednesday that it was looking to boost lagging volumes by attracting high-frequency trading firms.  But global regulators said earlier this month that high-frequency traders needed to be reined in to avoid a repeat of last year’s “flash crash” that briefly sent U.S. blue chips into freefall, sending shivers down the spines of investors.  High-frequency derived volumes now account for half or more of trading on exchanges such as the London Stock Exchange and U.S. trading platforms.

23,VZ,UPDATE 2-Isis hooks up with four payment networks," * Isis in deals with Visa, MasterCard, Discover, Amex   * Still expects to offer service in 2012   * Sees 2012 launch with “handful” of banks   (Adds Isis comment, background)   By Sinead Carew   NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) -  Isis, a venture of three of the top four U.S. mobile providers, plans to launch mobile payments services with major payment networks Visa (V.N), MasterCard (MA.N), Discover (DFS.N) and American Express (AXP.N), the venture said on Tuesday.   The venture of Verizon Wireless, AT&T Inc (T.N), and T-Mobile USA hopes to convince consumers to start using their mobile phones to pay for goods instead of plastic credit cards or cash.   Isis, which plans to kick off its service in the first half of 2012, will compete with Google Inc (GOOG.O) and No. 3 U.S. mobile service Sprint Nextel (S.N), which plan to launch services this summer.   Now that it has signed up the four payment networks, Isis expects to be able to more easily finalize deals with banks that issue credit cards, Ryan Hughes, Isis Chief Marketing Officer, told Reuters.   “It delivers a message to the banking community,” said Hughes, who noted that banks needed to know that their payment network partners would work with Isis before signing up as partners for the service.   Which payment networks are involved in the service launch depends on whether Isis has been able to sign up the network’s bank partners, said Hughes, who expects to have a “handful” of banks ready for its launch next year.   Participating banks need to invest in new technology to support a mobile payments and several have already done so, according to Hughes, who would not name bank partners.   Isis expects to make money from the service by generating revenue from their financial services partners and by offering merchants the option to link loyalty programs or coupon offerings to the Isis service, the executive said.   For example, instead of printing out a coupon found on a merchant’s website, consumers would be able to click on an Isis button to have the coupon delivered to their cellphone. Then the coupon could be applied automatically during a mobile transaction in that merchant’s store.   Hughes said merchants will be able to access an application interface to link their offerings with Isis.   While the company is still working on pricing for mobile payments, Hughes said he expects Isis to “take a small percentage of the cost of delivering” an ad or coupon to the Isis application.   In countries such as the United States, where most people have bank accounts and credit cards, analysts see easy-to-use electronic coupons and loyalty programs as the main way for wireless companies to convince consumers to pay with their cellphones instead of their credit cards.

25,VZ,Verizon to dominate Q2 wireless growth,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Wireless is expected to far outstrip its biggest rivals AT&T Inc and Sprint Nextel in subscriber growth for its first full quarter selling the Apple Inc iPhone.  But the top U.S. wireless service may not have long to celebrate, as it grapples with profit margin pressure and the possibility of new iPhone sellers.  Verizon Wireless is expected to add about 930,000 net subscribers in its second-quarter results to be issued July 22, according to the average of estimates from seven analysts contacted by Reuters.  AT&T, which lost exclusive rights to the iPhone when Verizon started selling the device in February, is expected to scrape together just 91,000 net new subscribers this quarter. Sprint is expected to lose about 15,000 contract customers, according to the same analysts.  AT&T plans to post its results July 21, a week before Sprint’s July 28 report.  On top of growth from the iPhone, analysts said Verizon Wireless also appears to be drumming up strong sales of smartphones for a high-speed network it is building based on Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology.  “It’s due to solid iPhone sales as well as LTE handsets selling well,” Mizuho analyst Michael Nelson said.  Apart from coping with the loss of iPhone exclusivity, which had boosted AT&T’s growth for more than three years, the No. 2 U.S. mobile provider also lost about 100,000 customers in the second quarter according to Nelson. Those were customers that came from an acquisition of Alltel assets, who would have had to switch phones to stick with AT&T.  AT&T is seeking regulatory approval to buy T-Mobile USA, the No. 4 U.S. mobile provider owned by Deutsche Telekom. If the deal is approved, the $39 billion transaction would create a new market leader in 2012, surpassing Verizon Wireless in customer numbers.  Verizon Wireless, jointly held by Verizon Communications and Vodafone Group, has long led the U.S. market in wireless service profit margins.  But those margins may have come under pressure because it pays a higher subsidy to sell iPhones than other devices. Those subsidies allow operators like Verizon and AT&T to discount phones in order to lure consumers into two-year contracts.  As a result, analysts see Verizon’s wireless service profit margin falling to as low as 44.7 percent in the second quarter, from 47.5 percent a year earlier. AT&T’s margin is expected to fall to about 40 percent from 43.1 percent a year.  Some analysts also speculate that Apple may allow Sprint Nextel, the No. 3 U.S. mobile service, and T-Mobile USA to sell the next version of iPhone, which is expected to go on sale in September.  That would create tougher competition for both Verizon and AT&T. If Sprint continues to offer wireless service plans that allow unlimited mobile web-surfing — a key offering for iPhone customers — this could make it more attractive to heavy data users than today’s two iPhone providers.  This puts pressure on Verizon Wireless to win as many new iPhone customers as it can and as quickly as possible, according to Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Larsen, who expects wider U.S. iPhone distribution to come soon.  “In general you’ll see share shift to Sprint and T-Mobile from Verizon and AT&T” if they get the iPhone Larsen said.

27,VZ,Senator Kohl says AT&T; deal should be blocked,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator Herb Kohl, chairman of the U.S. Senate’s antitrust subcommittee, urged the federal government to block AT&T’s $39 billion plan to buy T-Mobile USA, a unit of Deutsche Telekom.  In a letter to the Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission, Kohl said that the deal “would likely cause substantial harm to competition and consumers, would be contrary to antitrust law and not in the public interest, and therefore should be blocked by your agencies.”  Separately, three other lawmakers, Representatives Edward Markey, John Conyers and Anna Eshoo, also expressed concern about the deal on Wednesday, saying in a letter that they were worried about growing concentration in the wireless market.  In June, 76 lawmakers sent a letter to the Justice Department and FCC urging approval of the deal, citing AT&T’s promises to improve access to poor and rural Americans.  The lawmakers have no direct role in reviewing the merger that was proposed in March, but Congress, through oversight of the regulators and by holding hearings on such deals, can influence the climate of public opinion.  Kohl’s letter said the transaction would eliminate low-price competitor T-Mobile from the market.  If approved, the deal would vault No. 2 U.S. mobile service AT&T well ahead of current market leader Verizon Wireless and put nearly 80 percent of the wireless market in the hands of just two companies. Third placed Sprint Nextel has urged U.S. regulators to reject the deal.  Verizon Wireless is a venture of Verizon Communications and Vodafone Group Plc.  In his letter to Attorney General Eric Holder and FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski, Kohl said AT&T and T-Mobile are head-to-head competitors and the deal would leave just three nationwide wireless carriers.  Kohl argued that the market should be evaluated on a national basis, rather than by local markets as antitrust regulators often do in telecommunications deals.  Kohl also argued that there were no effective remedies that the companies could offer regulators that would allow them to fix the deal, saying that any proposed fix would “involve extensive regulatory supervision and interference with the complex on-going business operations of AT&T.”  Kohl is head of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s antitrust subcommittee, which oversees the Justice Department’s antitrust division.  AT&T said that it continued to believe the deal would be approved.  “We respect Senator Kohl,” said an AT&T spokesman in an emailed statement. “However, we feel his view is inconsistent with antitrust law, is shared by few others, and ignores the many positive benefits and numerous supporters of the transaction.”  The three representatives said in their letter that approval of the deal would be a backward step from nearly two decades of promoting competition by accepting a duopoly in the wireless marketplace.  “Such industry consolidation could reduce competition and increase consumer costs at a time our country can least afford it,” they said in their letter to Holder and Genachowski.

33,VZ,Google boosts federal lobbying,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google Inc boosted its spending to lobby the U.S. government by 54 percent in the second quarter, as the world’s No.1 Internet search engine faces an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission.  Google’s total federal lobbying spending during the quarter jumped to $2.06 million compared with $1.48 million in the first quarter and $1.34 million in the year-earlier period, according to documents filed by the company late on Wednesday.  Among the one dozen issues Google officials discussed with the federal government were privacy and competition issues in online advertising, as well as regulation of online advertising.  Google reported its lobbyists met with officials from the FTC, the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of representatives and the Executive Office of the President to discuss those topics.  Last month, Google disclosed the FTC was investigating some of its business practices. The company also faces antitrust investigations from several states and in the European Union.  “We want to help policymakers understand our business and the work we do to keep the Internet open, to encourage innovation, and to create economic opportunity. Lobbying is a part of that process,” a Google spokeswoman said in an emailed statement.  Google critics contend the Internet giant uses its search dominance to gain an unfair advantage over rivals, giving top-billing to its own services such as online maps, shopping and travel.  Some legal experts believe the FTC investigation is unlikely to result in the most drastic repercussions, such as breaking up the company or regulating its Web search algorithm, but could constrain Google’s efforts to acquire companies and expand into new markets.  Google, which generated roughly $29 billion in revenue in 2010, outspent rivals Microsoft Corp and Apple Inc in lobbying spending in the second quarter. Social networking giant Facebook spent $320,000 in federal lobbying during the quarter, compared with roughly $60,000 in the second quarter of 2010.

35,VZ,"AT&T; profit, subscriber growth beat expectations","NEW YORK (Reuters) - AT&T Inc (T.N) posted better-than-expected subscriber growth for the second quarter, pushing its profits and sales past Wall Street estimates despite the loss of exclusive U.S. rights to sell the Apple Inc (AAPL.O) iPhone.  The No. 2 U.S. mobile provider, which is seeking approval to buy T-Mobile USA for $39 billion, added 331,000 net subscribers in the quarter, compared with the average expectation for 91,000 from seven analysts contacted by Reuters.  “The net (subscriber) additions were surprisingly strong,” said Mizuho analyst Michael Nelson. “It seems like AT&T really successfully defended its turf after losing iPhone exclusivity.”  AT&T shares were up 1.1 percent to $30.57 in Thursday afternoon trading, in line with gains for stocks generally. Nelson said the strong results could be overshadowed by investor concern about growing opposition to AT&T’s controversial plan to buy T-Mobile USA.  U.S. Senator Herb Kohl, chairman of the Senate’s antitrust subcommittee, urged regulators on Wednesday to block the deal and other lawmakers also expressed concern. The deal would cost AT&T about $6 billion in breakup fees if it is rejected.  AT&T said on Thursday that it still expects the deal to close in the first quarter of 2012 and that U.S. regulators reviewing the transaction are “asking the questions you would expect.”  Its results came a day before rival Verizon Communications (VZ.N) was slated to release quarterly results. Verizon operates market leader Verizon Wireless in partnership with Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L).  In the first quarter of this year, Verizon Wireless started selling the iPhone, ending more than three years of AT&T’s exclusive rights to sell the device in the United States. While Verizon is expected to add about three times more subscribers than AT&T this quarter as a result, AT&T fared better than expected.  AT&T said the iPhone was still its strongest-selling smartphone despite the Verizon competition and that half of its customers were using smartphones by the end of the quarter, with 70 percent of its phone sales comprising the advanced phones, which command higher monthly service charges.  While wireless services have long been driving growth at AT&T, Chief Financial Officer John Stephens told analysts on a conference call that wireline revenue should start to resume growth soon even if the economy does not improve.  “Whether it happens in the third quarter or the fourth quarter, we’re on the cusp of it now,” said Stephens, who noted that business customer trends were improving.  One wrinkle in the results appeared to be slower than expected sales of connected devices which include the Amazon.com Kindle e-reader. AT&T’s 379,000 net additions of connected devices was well below an estimate for 750,000 from Pacific Crest analyst Steve Clement.  “Maybe the mix shifted quite a bit to the Wi-Fi only device,” said Clement. While many consumers buy e-readers with connections to cellular networks such as AT&T’s so they can download books on the run, others make do with cheaper devices that only support Wi-Fi short-range networks found in homes and cafes.  This could be why Amazon announced on July 13 that AT&T would sponsor Kindles with cellular connections — reducing the price to $139 from $189, Clement said.  AT&T said the shortfall may be seasonal after an initial flurry of purchases from consumers who received e-books around the holidays. AT&T numbers exclude customers who have not bought a book in 60 days.  AT&T’s net profit fell to $3.59 billion, or 60 cents per share, from $4 billion or 67 cents per share a year earlier and compared with analyst expectations for earnings of 59 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Excluding a Telmex Internacional transaction in the year-ago quarter, AT&T said earnings would have been flat.  Revenue rose 2.2 percent to $31.5 billion, compared with Wall Street expectations for $31.3 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  As well as subscriber numbers, Nelson said he was impressed with AT&T’s profit margin of 41.1 percent based on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. This compared with the analyst’s expectation for 39.6 percent.  AT&T said it increased its 2011 capital spending budget to around $20 billion from its previous target of $19 billion to support increasing demand for its wireless services.

This could be why Amazon announced on July 13 that AT&T would sponsor Kindles with cellular connections — reducing the price to $139 from $189, Clement said.   AT&T said the shortfall may be seasonal after an initial flurry of purchases from consumers who received e-books around the holidays. AT&T numbers exclude customers who have not bought a book in 60 days.   AT&T’s net profit fell to $3.59 billion, or 60 cents per share, from $4 billion or 67 cents per share a year earlier and compared with analyst expectations for earnings of 59 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   Excluding a Telmex Internacional transaction in the year-ago quarter, AT&T said earnings would have been flat.   Revenue rose 2.2 percent to $31.5 billion, compared with Wall Street expectations for $31.3 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   As well as subscriber numbers, Nelson said he was impressed with AT&T’s profit margin of 41.1 percent based on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. This compared with the analyst’s expectation for 39.6 percent.   AT&T said it increased its 2011 capital spending budget to around $20 billion from its previous target of $19 billion to support increasing demand for its wireless services.

37,VZ,"UPDATE 4-AT&T; profit, subscriber growth beat expectations","   * Q2 shr $0.60 vs $0.67 year ago   * Q2 rev $31.5 billion vs Street view $31.3 billion   * Adds 331,000 net subscribers vs analyst view 91,000   * Shares up slightly in morning trade  (Adds analyst comment, connected device sales, share price)   By Sinead Carew   NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters) - AT&T Inc’s (T.N) second-quarter profit and revenue beat Wall Street estimates and it added more subscribers than expected despite the loss of exclusive U.S. rights to sell Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) iPhone.   The No. 2 U.S. mobile provider, which is seeking approval to buy T-Mobile USA for $39 billion, added 331,000 net subscribers in the quarter, compared with the average expectation for 91,000 from seven analysts contacted by Reuters.   “The net (subscriber) additions were surprisingly strong,” said Mizuho analyst Michael Nelson. “It seems like AT&T really successfully defended its turf after losing iPhone exclusivity.”   AT&T shares were up 12 cents at $30.35 on Thursday morning. Nelson noted that the strong results could be overshadowed by investor concern about growing opposition to AT&T’s controversial plan to buy T-Mobile USA.   U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl, chairman of the Senate’s antitrust subcommittee, urged regulators on Wednesday to block the deal and other lawmakers also expressed concern. The deal would cost AT&T about $6 billion in breakup fees if it is rejected. [ID:nN1E76J1CI]   AT&T said on Thursday that it still expects the deal to close in the first quarter of 2012 and that U.S. regulators reviewing the transaction are “asking the questions you would expect.”   Its results came a day before its bigger rival Verizon Wireless — a venture of Verizon Communications (VZ.N) and Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L) — was slated to release quarterly results.   In the first quarter of this year, Verizon Wireless started selling iPhone, ending more than three years of AT&T’s exclusive rights to sell the device in the United States. While Verizon is expected to add about three times more subscribers than AT&T this quarter as a result, AT&T fared better than expected.   AT&T said iPhone was still its strongest-selling smartphone despite the Verizon competition.   One wrinkle in the results appeared to be slower than expected sales of connected devices which include the Amazon.com (AMZN.O) Kindle e-reader. AT&T’s 379,000 net additions of connected devices was well below an estimate for 750,000 from Pacific Crest analyst Steve Clement.   “Maybe the mix shifted quite a bit to the Wi-Fi only device,” said Clement.

38,VZ,Verizon iPhone sales dash hopes; shares fall,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications may have the iPhone, but the blockbuster smartphone has yet to pay off in its battle against AT&T Inc.  In the second quarter, Verizon Wireless, the No. 1 U.S. mobile service, signed up 1.3 million fewer iPhone customers than AT&T, dashing high hopes of investors who sent its shares down almost 3 percent.  On top of this, Verizon Wireless customers spent less per month than expected as the company changed its data service price plans, further disappointing Wall Street on Friday.  While Verizon Wireless added three times more net subscribers in the quarter than AT&T, it only activated 2.3 million Apple Inc iPhones compared with 3.6 million activations at AT&T.  “AT&T has done a much better job of hanging on to iPhone customers than anybody expected,” said Credit Suisse analyst Jonathan Chaplin.  There was simply not enough good news in the report to justify Verizon’s richer valuation than AT&T’s, said Chaplin, who said Verizon shares have been trading at about 14 times 2012 earnings estimates compared with AT&T’s 12 multiple.  Verizon Wireless’ 1.9 percent growth in average monthly revenue per user (ARPU) was well behind Chaplin’s expectation for 2.9 percent.  “Without the share gain in the smartphone category driving the ARPU, which would drive earnings per share growth, it’s difficult to get enthusiastic about the (Verizon) shares at this valuation,” Chaplin said.  AT&T may leapfrog Verizon Wireless and become the top U.S. mobile service next year if regulators approve its plan to buy Deutsche Telekom unit T-Mobile USA.  And while  the subscriber numbers were strong on the surface “they were the wrong kind of subscribers,” Chaplin said. Subscribers using devices such as the iPhone spend more on data services on a monthly basis than other wireless customers.  Verizon Wireless said it would now take it a quarter longer than expected to increase its smartphone user base to 50 percent of is subscribers. It blamed the delay on the launch of the next iPhone a quarter later than it had expected. Verizon said it now expects to sell the next version of iPhone in the autumn.  Still, Verizon Wireless, owned by Verizon and Vodafone Group Plc, added 1.3 million net subscribers in the quarter compared with the average expectation for about 930,000, according to seven analysts contacted by Reuters.  Stifel Nicolaus analyst Chris King was impressed with Verizon’s customer growth and its sale of 1.2 million high-speed wireless devices for the new 4G network it is building.  While some investors had worried that the relatively expensive iPhone would hurt Verizon’s profit margins, King said its wireless service margin of 45.4 percent was well ahead of his expectation for 43.9 percent.  Verizon’s quarterly profit was $1.61 billion, or 57 cents a share and was ahead of the average analyst estimate of 55 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Revenue rose 2.8 percent to $27.53 billion, ahead of Wall Street expectations for $27.42 billion.  Also on Friday, Verizon named Chief Operating Officer Lowell McAdam as chief executive, starting August 1. McAdam, the former CEO of Verizon Wireless, is replacing Ivan Seidenberg, who will remain chairman. The move follows its succession plan announced late last year.  Seidenberg has led Verizon since its inception in 2000 and before that he was CEO of Verizon’s predecessor companies. The executive, who started out as a cable splicer’s assistant at New York Telephone, has worked at the company for more than 40 years.  Verizon shares were down $1.06 or 2.8 percent at $36.51 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after falling as much as 3 percent shortly after the market opened.

46,VZ,Senator Al Franken urges rejection of AT&T; T-Mobile deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator Al Franken called on federal regulators on Tuesday to reject AT&T Inc’s proposed buy of rival T-Mobile, saying it would mean pricier wireless and could cost thousands of jobs.  AT&T, the No. 2 U.S. mobile provider, is seeking regulators’ approval to buy T-Mobile USA, a unit of Deutsche Telekom AG, for $39 billion.  Franken, a Minnesota Democrat, said in a letter to the heads of the Federal Communications Commission and Justice Department, which are reviewing the merger, that the transaction was not in the public interest and could not be fixed by putting conditions on it.  “The competitive effects of a merger of this size and scope will reverberate throughout the telecommunications sector for decades to come and will affect consumer prices, customer service, innovation, competition in handsets and the quality and quantity of network coverage. These threats are too large and too irrevocable to be prevented or alleviated by conditions,” wrote Franken.  The letter dated Tuesday was sent to FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski and three fellow commissioners, as well as Attorney General Eric Holder.  The other giant in the wireless space is rival and market leader Verizon Wireless, a joint venture of Verizon Communications Inc and Vodafone Group Plc.  Franken quoted economists from third place Sprint Nextel Corp as estimating that, if AT&T buys T-Mobile, then AT&T and Verizon would control 82 percent of the postpaid wireless market nationwide.  He also expressed skepticism AT&T would live up to its promise to deploy LTE broadband to more than 97 percent of Americans after the merger.  Last, the deal would also allow the giant wireless companies to stifle competition by closing off new companies’ access to popular handsets, roaming and other needed services, with the inevitable result that wireless prices would go up, wrote Franken.  Franken, while acknowledging union support for the deal, said he feared its approval would lead to thousands or tens of thousands of layoffs.  “I ... urge you to compel AT&T to publicly release its plans for job cuts in the first, second, and third years following the merger approval,” wrote Franken. “Many proponents of this merger have acknowledged that short-term job losses may occur, but I think it is important for the American public to understand exactly what those numbers will be, especially given the weak state of the U.S. job market.”  AT&T and T-Mobile said it had strong support for the merger.  “While we respect Senator Franken, his analysis of our pending transaction is just wrong,” Tom Sugrue, T-Mobile senior vice president of government affairs, said in a statement. The merger should be approved because it will deliver consumers “speed, service quality and reduced costs,” he added.  Jim Cicconi, AT&T’s senior executive vice president-external and legislative affairs, said in an email: “It is very clear that the few opposing voices are far outweighed by the enormous depth and breadth of support we are seeing.  “And, as more officials and organizations learn about the major benefits of this merger, that support continues to grow.”  U.S. Senator Herb Kohl, chairman of the Senate’s antitrust subcommittee, has also urged regulators to block the deal, and other lawmakers also expressed concern. A rejection would cost AT&T about $6 billion in breakup fees.  Despite criticism from many quarters, AT&T said recently it still expected to close the deal in the first quarter of 2012.

48,VZ,Reid's debt plan could speed wireless auctions,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Efforts to give U.S. regulators the authority to auction off some television airwaves for mobile broadband use are getting a boost in a debt ceiling plan proposed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.  The auctions have the potential to raise $15 billion in revenue, according to Reid’s plan, with some of the proceeds going to broadcasters as compensation.  The Federal Communications Commission has been pushing for the authority to hold such auctions as a part of its broader National Broadband Plan. The FCC wants to repurpose 120 megahertz of spectrum currently used by TV broadcasters to free up more airwaves for rapidly growing wireless services.  The final shape of a plan to cut government spending in an effort to gain Republican support for raising the nation’s $14.3 trillion borrowing limit is very uncertain.  Lawmakers are still far apart over competing plans in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate to raise the debt ceiling before August 2, when the U.S. Treasury says the government will start to run out of money to pay its bills.  The debt package proposed by House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, does not include spectrum auctions, multiple industry sources said.  But the inclusion by Reid, a Democrat, of the auction revenues could speed a spectrum reshuffle if it were to become part of the final plan.  Some 25 million Americans already watch video on smartphones and tablet computers like Apple Inc’s iPad, putting 120 times more demand on spectrum than older mobile phones.  “This deficit-reducing proposal reflects insight from members of the FCC, leading economists and wireless technology experts, all of whom have cautioned a spectrum crunch is looming,” said Jonathan Spalter, chairman of Mobile Future, a coalition whose membership includes technology and communications companies.  But broadcasters have expressed concerns over the unintended consequences repurposing their spectrum could have on their TV signals and the 46 million viewers that still rely on over-the-air TV.  Broadcasters worry that the FCC’s plan would affect not only those who voluntarily part with their spectrum, but the entire industry. The FCC would “repack,” or move TV stations, to make large swaths of spectrum considered more suited for mobile broadband use available.  A study released by the National Association of Broadcasters on Monday found that 40 percent of U.S. full power local television stations could have to vacate their current TV channel assignment.  “NAB is deeply concerned about provisions currently in Senate Majority Leader Reid’s legislation that would threaten the future of a great American institution — free and local television. We will work with him as the process moves forward in hopes that our issues can be addressed,” said Dennis Wharton, NAB’s executive vice president of communications.

50,VZ,RadioShack shuns T-Mobile for Verizon,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - RadioShack Corp disconnected an unprofitable wireless partnership with T-Mobile and replaced it with much bigger Verizon Wireless, sending shares of the U.S. consumer electronics chain up 19 percent.  The news, which overshadowed weaker-than-expected results from the retailer on Tuesday, came less than six months after RadioShack alleged that Deutsche Telekom AG’s T-Mobile USA unit had “materially breached” their contract. The retailer has also said T-Mobile’s product offerings were not competitive with those of other carriers.  The retailer did not shed light on how T-Mobile violated the contract, but indicated that pulling the plug on that partnership was a simpler, faster and cheaper solution to the problem than a costly legal battle with T-Mobile.  RadioShack said Verizon Wireless, a joint venture of Verizon Communications Inc and Vodafone Group Plc, would provide postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services in more than 4,300 RadioShack U.S. stores starting September 15.  Verizon Wireless is the No. 1 U.S. mobile provider.  “That is actually a pretty big deal,” Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said. “Verizon is a pretty big partner. T-Mobile was a pretty small partner.”  Verizon is “three times as big” as T-Mobile, Pachter said. adding that Verizon’s larger customer base would be a boon to the retailer, which has been struggling with weak sales despite its “ubiquitous” presence in the United States.  Other industry watchers agreed.  “This trades the weak for the strong,” Janney Capital Markets analyst David Strasser said.  The underperformance of T-Mobile has been a significant drag on RadioShack’s business since the fourth quarter of last year and has continued into the first and second quarters of this year, Chief Executive Officer Jim Gooch acknowledged on Tuesday.  “While it is difficult to predict the pace of improvement we will see in our business as we add Verizon Wireless to our offerings, we are comfortable with the range of analysts’ earnings estimates for the remainder of 2011,” Gooch said.  RadioShack’s partnership with T-Mobile had been a cause of worry for analysts.  “RadioShack gave up a lot of compensation from AT&T (Inc) and Sprint (Nextel Corp) to carry T-Mobile, and this partnership doesn’t appear to be panning out the way management expected,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Scot Ciccarelli said in April.  Meanwhile, T-Mobile said it was all set to partner with another key retailer soon.  “We are currently focused on higher-return national retailer opportunities and we expect to announce new channel growth in the coming weeks, which will be more than double the number of RadioShack doors currently offering T-Mobile products and services,” Hernan Daguerre, T-Mobile director of communications, said in an e-mailed statement.  RadioShack’s quarterly profit dropped after weak consumer demand and cutthroat competition forced it to offer more margin-sapping discounts.  Net income fell to $24.9 million, or 24 cents a share, in the second quarter, from $53.0 million, or 41 cents a share, a year earlier.  Sales at the company, which was recently dropped from the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, fell to $941.9 million from $962.3 million in the year-ago period.  Excluding items, RadioShack earned 31 cents a share in the quarter. On that basis, analysts on average were expecting a profit of 37 cents a share, on sales of $1.03 billion according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  The retailer has sought to counter weak demand for converter boxes, antennas and other accessories by selling wireless devices and calling plans.  Wedbush’s Pachter, who has a “neutral” rating and $14 target on RadioShack’s shares, was optimistic about the deal with Verizon, but said the company has still not done enough to rebrand itself as a destination for mobile phones or to cater to younger customers.  In afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading, RadioShack shares were up $2.51 or 19.2 percent to $15.60.

53,VZ,Analysis: Canadians who follow RIM take pity on a local hero,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Wall Street and Silicon Valley have issued verdicts on Research In Motion, and they are mostly damning for the BlackBerry maker. Canadians, on the other hand, are eager to give their compatriot the benefit of the doubt.  In both the smartphone and tablet computer markets, the momentum belongs to Apple, which edges ever closer to the title of world’s most valuable stock, and Google, its Android software embraced by an army of device makers.  By contrast, RIM’s shares have fallen 60 percent from a February peak, hammered by a litany of bad news. The company has missed its own limp quarterly forecasts, suffered crucial delays in bringing advanced smartphones to market and elicited yawns when it launched its long-awaited PlayBook tablet.  In the latest sign of decline, RIM said on Monday it will cut 11 percent of its workforce, even as it rushes to pull off a tricky transition to a new Blackberry operating system.  Against that backdrop, there is a discernible gap between Canadian and non-Canadian analysts covering the struggling Ontario-based technology leader. Put simply, the Canadians have a lot more time for their national champion.  One in five analysts covering RIM currently suggest buying the stock. But the ratio is one in three for Canadian analysts, and many Canadians think the stock sell-off is overdone.  “The pessimism of the big U.S. bulge-bracket firms is really what presumably has driven the stock to the levels that it’s at,” said Paul Taylor, chief investment officer for BMO Harris Private Banking. The Bank of Montreal unit manages C$14.5 billion ($15.3 billion) for wealthy Canadians and holds less than C$100 million of RIM stock.  “It irks them to think a Canadian company could possibly have the backbone to compete with the likes of Apple,” said Taylor, who clearly thinks investors aren’t giving RIM a fair shake.  RIM has long been a source of Canadian pride, a start-up that beat giants like Ericsson and Motorola to make the BlackBerry’s secure mobile email an essential tool. Now a global firm with billions in quarterly sales, RIM faces a new generation of users besotted with its touchscreen rivals.  Still, Canadian enthusiasm runs deep. A prime example is Scotia Capital’s Gus Papageorgiou, who kept an “outperform” rating on RIM since before the iPhone launched in early 2007.  Papageorgiou’s price targets since early 2009, on average, were 80 percent higher than the stock’s close that day.  Just before RIM issued disappointing quarterly numbers and a weak outlook last month, leading to the stock’s sharpest one-day decline in years, Papageorgiou forecast a price above C$80 a year later.  Even now he expects the stock to trade at C$57 in 12 months, while at least six U.S. firms (and one Canadian bank) see it staying under $30. The average target is $38. The targets differ slightly depending on whether the Nasdaq or Toronto-listed stock is quoted.  Papageorgiou declined to comment for this article.  Not everyone has held on so long. At RBC Capital Markets, analyst Mike Abramsky abandoned his “top pick” rating in April and slashed his target price to $55 from $90.

54,VZ,Canadians who follow RIM take pity on a local hero,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Wall Street and Silicon Valley have issued verdicts on Research In Motion RIM.TO, and they are mostly damning for the BlackBerry maker. Canadians, on the other hand, are eager to give their compatriot the benefit of the doubt.  In both the smartphone and tablet computer markets, the momentum belongs to Apple (AAPL.O), which edges ever closer to the title of world’s most valuable stock, and Google (GOOG.O), its Android software embraced by an army of device makers.  By contrast, RIM’s shares have fallen 60 percent from a February peak, hammered by a litany of bad news. The company has missed its own limp quarterly forecasts, suffered crucial delays in bringing advanced smartphones to market and elicited yawns when it launched its long-awaited PlayBook tablet.  In the latest sign of decline, RIM said on Monday it will cut 11 percent of its workforce, even as it rushes to pull off a tricky transition to a new Blackberry operating system.  Against that backdrop, there is a discernible gap between Canadian and non-Canadian analysts covering the struggling Ontario-based technology leader. Put simply, the Canadians have a lot more time for their national champion.  One in five analysts covering RIM currently suggest buying the stock. But the ratio is one in three for Canadian analysts, and many Canadians think the stock sell-off is overdone.  “The pessimism of the big U.S. bulge-bracket firms is really what presumably has driven the stock to the levels that it’s at,” said Paul Taylor, chief investment officer for BMO Harris Private Banking. The Bank of Montreal (BMO.TO) unit manages C$14.5 billion for wealthy Canadians and holds less than C$100 million of RIM stock.  “It irks them to think a Canadian company could possibly have the backbone to compete with the likes of Apple,” said Taylor, who clearly thinks investors aren’t giving RIM a fair shake.  RIM has long been a source of Canadian pride, a start-up that beat giants like Ericsson and Motorola to make the BlackBerry’s secure mobile email an essential tool. Now a global firm with billions in quarterly sales, RIM faces a new generation of users besotted with its touchscreen rivals.  Still, Canadian enthusiasm runs deep. A prime example is Scotia Capital’s Gus Papageorgiou, who kept an “outperform” rating on RIM since before the iPhone launched in early 2007.  Papageorgiou’s price targets since early 2009, on average, were 80 percent higher than the stock’s close that day.  Just before RIM issued disappointing quarterly numbers and a weak outlook last month, leading to the stock’s sharpest one-day decline in years, Papageorgiou forecast a price above C$80 a year later.  Even now he expects the stock to trade at C$57 in 12 months, while at least six U.S. firms (and one Canadian bank) see it staying under $30. The average target is $38. The targets differ slightly depending on whether the Nasdaq or Toronto-listed stock is quoted.  Papageorgiou declined to comment for this article.  Not everyone has held on so long. At RBC Capital Markets, analyst Mike Abramsky abandoned his “top pick” rating in April and slashed his target price to $55 from $90. Two months later he dropped it to $35 and this month he urged RIM to split into two separate businesses.  Opinion is sharply divided on RIM’s long-term prospects.

55,VZ,Business borrowing jumps in June: ELFA,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A measure of business activity improved in June as companies borrowed more to replace equipment, a lender group said on Tuesday.  The Equipment Leasing and Finance Association (ELFA) said U.S. businesses originated $7.3 billion in loans, leases and lines of credit in June for investment in everything from industrial equipment to computer systems and office furniture,  The figure was up 33 percent from a year earlier and up 30 percent from May. So far this year, new borrowings are up 28.5 percent from the year-earlier period.  ELFA, which reports economic activity for the $521 billion equipment finance sector, measures some of the same trends as the government’s durable goods report and the Institute of Supply Management index, but it precedes them by a few days.  Confidence about the direction of the leasing industry is higher, according to the survey. The monthly confidence index rose almost 7 percent to 56.2.  ELFA Chief Executive William Sutton said although the number of transactions submitted for approval decreased during the month, the number of approvals shot up.  “We may have had a real increase in quality,” Sutton said.  The group, which represents the lenders that finance half of the capital investment in the United States each year, said 2.5 percent of borrowers were delinquent 30 days or more, down from 2.9 percent in May.  Credit approvals in June increased to 79 percent from 76 percent in May.  ELFA members include Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), and financing affiliates or subsidiaries of Canon Inc (7751.T), Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), Dell Inc DELL.O, Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), among others.

The Louisiana Public Service Commission, which regulates public utilities and transportation in the state, said it voted 4-1 to approve the merger, after staff found nothing to suggest the wireless deal was contrary to the public interest.  Separately, 11 state attorneys general wrote to the U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission in support of the transaction that would vault the combined companies ahead of current market leader Verizon Wireless.  Attorneys general from Arkansas, Utah, Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota, West Virginia and Wyoming said they believed the merger would bring better service and faster data speeds.  They asked for merger-specific conditions to protect competition and the public interest without delaying the merger, according to a news release from the Arkansas AG’s office.  A statement by the Utah attorney general said the merger may raise competitive concerns in some discrete local markets and the AGs asked for targeted remedies in those cases.  The ultimate decision on the deal rests with the Justice Department, that is conducting an antitrust review, and the FCC, which is weighing whether the transaction is in the public interest.  The merger would concentrate 80 percent of the U.S. wireless market in just two companies — AT&T/T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless, a venture of Verizon Communications (VZ.N) and Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L).  AT&T argues that the purchase of T-Mobile will help it expand faster service to more customers.  Critics charge that less competition will increase prices and limit consumer choice.  AT&T’s top lawyer welcomed the position of the 11 state attorneys general.  “Their call for federal regulators to expeditiously review and approve the merger further builds on our unprecedented nationwide support from federal, state and local elected officials, national unions, non-profit organizations, and high-tech and venture capital firms,” said Wayne Watts, AT&T’s senior executive vice president and general counsel.  But some prominent U.S. lawmakers and competitors have come out against the deal, including Senator Herb Kohl, chairman of the U.S. Senate’s antitrust subcommittee.  Third-ranked U.S. wireless carrier Sprint Nextel (S.N) has said AT&T should use the money it plans to pay for T-Mobile to improve its network without removing a national competitor.  Sprint spokesman John Taylor said the Louisiana commission’s decision was simply not to oppose AT&T’s takeover and to instead defer to the FCC — “far from the ringing endorsement AT&T sought.”  ",7272011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tmobile-att-states/atts-t-mobile-plan-gets-boost-from-states-idUSTRE76Q6P020110727

58,VZ,Reid's debt plan could speed wireless auctions,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Efforts to give U.S. regulators the authority to auction off some television airwaves for mobile broadband use are getting a boost in a debt ceiling plan proposed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.  The auctions have the potential to raise $15 billion in revenue, according to Reid’s plan, with some of the proceeds going to broadcasters as compensation.  The Federal Communications Commission has been pushing for the authority to hold such auctions as a part of its broader National Broadband Plan. The FCC wants to repurpose 120 megahertz of spectrum currently used by TV broadcasters to free up more airwaves for rapidly growing wireless services.  The final shape of a plan to cut government spending in an effort to gain Republican support for raising the nation’s $14.3 trillion borrowing limit is very uncertain.  Lawmakers are still far apart over competing plans in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate to raise the debt ceiling before August 2, when the U.S. Treasury says the government will start to run out of money to pay its bills.  The debt package proposed by House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, does not include spectrum auctions, multiple industry sources said.  But the inclusion by Reid, a Democrat, of the auction revenues could speed a spectrum reshuffle if it were to become part of the final plan.  Some 25 million Americans already watch video on smartphones and tablet computers like Apple Inc’s iPad, putting 120 times more demand on spectrum than older mobile phones.  “This deficit-reducing proposal reflects insight from members of the FCC, leading economists and wireless technology experts, all of whom have cautioned a spectrum crunch is looming,” said Jonathan Spalter, chairman of Mobile Future, a coalition whose membership includes technology and communications companies.  But broadcasters have expressed concerns over the unintended consequences repurposing their spectrum could have on their TV signals and the 46 million viewers that still rely on over-the-air TV.  Broadcasters worry that the FCC’s plan would affect not only those who voluntarily part with their spectrum, but the entire industry. The FCC would “repack,” or move TV stations, to make large swaths of spectrum considered more suited for mobile broadband use available.  A study released by the National Association of Broadcasters on Monday found that 40 percent of U.S. full power local television stations could have to vacate their current TV channel assignment.  “NAB is deeply concerned about provisions currently in Senate Majority Leader Reid’s legislation that would threaten the future of a great American institution — free and local television. We will work with him as the process moves forward in hopes that our issues can be addressed,” said Dennis Wharton, NAB’s executive vice president of communications.

61,VZ,"Sprint results disappoint, shares fall 20 percent","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sprint Nextel Corp’s shares plunged nearly 20 percent on Thursday as heavy subscriber losses in the second quarter called into question the strategy and outlook of the No. 3 U.S. wireless company.  Sprint had spent heavily to promote its service and better compete against larger rivals Verizon Wireless and AT&T Inc. But that strategy backfired as profit margins eroded and customer losses persisted.  The weak results overshadowed Sprint’s announcement of a $9 billion network contract with start-up LightSquared, and sent the stock tumbling to its lowest point since February before recovering a little to close down 16 percent.  Investors questioned whether Sprint would be able to meet its 2011 targets after such a disappointing performance.  “Their cost of doing business went up dramatically,” said Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Larsen. “People have less confidence they can meet expectations.”  Sprint’s operating profit margin of 16.3 percent was well below the average Wall Street estimate of around 19 percent as the company had changed its product rebate terms in an effort to combat Verizon Wireless’ sale of the Apple Inc iPhone, and an iPhone discount at AT&T.  But the bet did not pay off as Sprint still saw defections of 101,000 net subscribers — also known as post-paid customers — compared with analysts’ expectation for losses of 15,000.  Meanwhile, Verizon Wireless added 1.3 million subscribers in the quarter and AT&T added 331,000 subscribers.  Chief Financial Officer Joe Euteneuer said Sprint made a “conscious decision” to spend more in the second quarter in the hope of avoiding getting “killed with market share.”  “This was a unique quarter because of intense competition,” he told analysts on a conference call.  Sprint warned the rate of customer defections would worsen this quarter, in line with typical third-quarter trends, but repeated a promise for subscriber growth in full-year 2011.  Chief Executive Dan Hesse said improvements in subscriber numbers in June gave him confidence the company could meet its targets for the rest of the year.  “If we continue at the current pace of improvement we will get there. The only way we won’t is if performance deteriorates,” Hesse told Reuters.  But analysts doubted if Sprint could meet its target for a 2011 operating profit that is roughly the same as in 2010.  “People are right to be skeptical,” Pacific Crest analyst Steve Clement said. “They didn’t point to any silver bullet.”  Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett was also skeptical.  “Without post-paid subscriber growth, Sprint has little prospect of generating sustainable revenue growth, nor of generating sustainably rising margins,” he said. “On those critical dimensions, Sprint’s results were a clear disappointment.”  Adding to the uncertainty, Sprint did not outline its plans to develop fourth-generation (4G) high-speed wireless services, and instead postponed that announcement to October.  Even news of the LightSquared deal failed to comfort investors, who questioned if they would ever see the fruits of that partnership because it is dependent on LightSquared solving difficult technology problems and raising money.  Under the agreement, LightSquared — backed by hedge-fund manager Philip Falcone’s Harbinger Capital — will pay Sprint $9 billion in cash over 11 years. Sprint also has the option to rent space on the LightSquared network through credits estimated to be worth $4.5 billion.  The news pushed Clearwire shares down 22 percent as Sprint is its majority owner and biggest customer. Sprint declined to comment when asked if it would continue to use Clearwire beyond its current agreement which expires in 2012.  “It’s less clear that Sprint and Clearwire will have a long-term fruitful relationship,” Larsen said.  Hesse said he would be in a position to give a clearer picture of Sprint’s strategy on October 7.  “There are some new pieces to the puzzle that were unanticipated that will add strength and color to the story if we wait a little longer,” Hesse said without giving details.  Sprint’s loss widened to $847 million, or 28 cents per share, from $760 million, or 25 cents a share, a year earlier.  Excluding items such as losses from its Clearwire investment, Sprint’s loss per share of 6 cents was better than Wall Street expectations for 12 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

63,VZ,Telecoms eye U.S. shift in subsidy focus to Web," * Telecom companies submit FCC filing on USF, ICC reform   * Plan would shift fund focus to broadband deployment   * Critics support shift but wary of the plan’s particulars   By Jasmin Melvin   WASHINGTON, July 29 (Reuters) - Six telecom providers told U.S. regulators they could begin to fund in 2012 a revamped government subsidy program that would help deploy high-speed Internet service to 4 million Americans living in rural and costly-to-serve areas.   The commitment was part of a proposal sent to the Federal Communications Commission as it shifts the focus of its $8 billion universal service fund to broadband service from phone lines.   AT&T (T.N), CenturyLink (CTL.N), FairPoint FRP.O, Frontier Communications FTR.N, Verizon (VZ.N) and Windstream (WIN.O) said on Friday they backed the proposal that could help provide broadband to underserved areas.   The current patchwork of programs in the FCC’s fund — paid for by fees added to consumers’ telephone bills — would be fully replaced by two new universal service programs to support fixed and mobile broadband under the telecom companies’ plan. The transition would be complete in 2016.   The industry proposal would also gradually lower the charges phone companies pay to each other for handling voice traffic, reforming the complex system of payments between carriers called intercarrier compensation.   The plan follows the FCC’s request for industry input after it proposed new rules in February to modernize the universal service fund. More than 20 million Americans are without access to high-speed Internet.   “We’re pleased that many have taken up that challenge, and we will consider those proposals as we finalize reforms,” an FCC official said.   “We urge the FCC to use the momentum this proposal has created to complete the reform process this fall,” Representatives Greg Walden and Lee Terry, chairman and vice chairman of the House communications subcommittee, said in a statement.   But elements of the industry plan were criticized by others.   Public interest group Free Press, while in support of shifting universal service to a broadband focus, said the proposal could raise the rates of urban customers.   Companies are expected to rely more on retail customer revenue as revenues from intercarrier compensation charges are lost. To ease this shift, the proposal from the six companies would loosen regulations on rates and pricing flexibility.   Free Press also said that federal subscriber line charge rates could go up by as much as $3.75 by July 2016.   “Raising this fee for everyone in the name of increasing the self-sufficiency of a small number of already highly profitable rural phone companies is unnecessary,” Free Press Research Director Derek Turner said in a statement.   The proposal argues that monthly subscriber line charges would be kept in check by competition, and the rate increases are capped as an additional protection to consumers.   The National Cable and Telecommunications Association said it would work with the FCC and other groups to achieve reforms, while the American Cable Association, representing independent companies providing broadband service to 7.6 million subscribers, said it would send its own comments to the FCC regarding the agency’s proposed rulemaking.

64,VZ,Vodafone to pay out $3.3 billion in Verizon windfall,"LONDON (Reuters) - Vodafone (VOD.L) shareholders will get $3.3 billion from a long-awaited Verizon Wireless dividend, raising hopes for regular payouts from the U.S. company after a six-year drought.  Shares in Vodafone, the world’s biggest mobile phone operator by revenue, rose as much as 5.7 percent on Friday after Verizon Wireless said it would pay $10 billion to the British company and co-owner Verizon Communications (VZ.N).  “Verizon’s attempt to squeeze Vodafone has resoundingly failed, they now have no choice but to pay the cash,” analyst Robin Bienenstock at brokerage Bernstein said, predicting regular dividends.  Vodafone has not received a payout from Verizon Wireless, in which it holds 45 percent, since 2005, partly because Verizon had hoped to force Vodafone out of the joint venture by not paying a dividend, say analysts.  The development is the latest victory in a campaign by Chief Executive Vittorio Colao’s campaign to make Vodafone’s sprawling portfolio more effective.  In the last year, Vodafone has resolved several shared-ownership issues, including buying Essar out of an Indian joint venture for $5.46 billion and selling a stake in China Mobile (0941.HK) for $6.5 billion.  Newbury, England-based Vodafone said its shareholders would receive 2 billion pounds ($3.3 billion) from its $4.5 billion share of the windfall via a special 4 pence-a-share dividend to be paid in February, with the balance used to pay down debt.  Shares in Vodafone were up 4.5 percent, or 7.2 pence, at 172.6 pence by 1033 GMT, having earlier risen as high as 174.9 pence to levels not seen since May. It was the biggest gainer on Britain's blue-chip FTSE 100 index .FTSE.  “We believe this will mark the resumption of regular dividend flows from VZW (Verizon Wireless),” Investec analysts wrote in a note to clients, adding it may also prove a turning point in Vodafone’s relationship with its U.S. partner.  “Verizon Wireless is the cash cow for Verizon (Communications) and in order that Verizon can sustain its dividends to shareholders, we believe the cash must continue to flow from VZW,” they wrote, reiterating a “buy” recommendation on Vodafone shares.  Vodafone had flagged in May that it expected to receive a dividend from Verizon next year.  “The timing of this announcement is pleasingly early and Vodafone immediately saying exactly what it will do with it is also welcome news,” MF Global analyst John Karidis said.  “This 4 pence special dividend may well happen every year, and it may well grow.”  Bernstein’s Bienenstock noted that including the special dividend, the effective yield on Vodafone next year would be 14.5 percent, putting the mobile operator ahead of many of its competitors in the sector such as Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE), on 6.5 percent, and BT (BT.L) on 3.7 percent.  The $4.5 billion payment to Vodafone is $1 billion less than the amount the British company’s chief financial officer said he expected on June 30, but analysts at Deutsche Bank said it was higher than their base case expectations.

66,VZ,"American Express, Verizon in mobile payments deal","   * Deal involves pre-loading of Serve app on Verizon phones   * Separate deal to Amex/Isis pact for in-store payments   NEW YORK, Aug 1 (Reuters) - American Express Co (AXP.N) is teaming up with No. 1 U.S. mobile service Verizon Wireless to offer online and person-to-person payments in the credit card company’s latest effort to expand in the mobile payments business.   The partnership comes weeks after American Express announced a deal with Sprint (S.N). The credit card company also recently unveiled a separate agreement with Isis, Verizon’s mobile payments venture.   Under the latest agreement, Verizon Wireless will pre-load many of its smartphones with the American Express “Serve” application, which will allow Verizon customers to make online payments by typing in their phone number and a personal identification number instead of having to type out their credit card number.   Serve allows individuals to pay one another with no transaction fees, and also comes with a card that can be used to pay any merchant that accepts American Express.   The Serve platform allows American Express to attract to its payments network customers who usually pay with cash, checks, and debit cards.   American Express built its Serve business on the foundation of Revolution Money, a company launched by Steve Case’s Revolution LLC that American Express acquired in early 2010. Steve Case is a co-founder of America Online.   Isis, which will introduce services in 2012, is a venture of Verizon Wireless, AT&T Inc (T.N) and T-Mobile USA, a unit of Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE). Verizon Wireless is a joint venture between Verizon Communications (VZ.N) and Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L).   The separate Isis partnership is designed to allow in-store payments where consumers will be able to wave their phone at the check-out terminal to pay.

68,VZ,U.S. lawmaker challenges opposition to AT&T; merger,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, urged the federal government to resist one-sided calls to block AT&T Inc’s $39 billion plan to buy wireless rival T-Mobile USA.  In a letter sent Monday to the U.S. Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission, Representative Lamar Smith said calls to block the merger that ignore the deal’s benefits to wireless service paint an incomplete picture.  “I urge you to carefully weigh all of the evidence, including the many benefits of this transaction, before coming to a conclusion,” the Republican from Texas wrote.  The ultimate decision on the deal rests with the Justice Department, that is conducting an antitrust review, and the FCC, which is weighing whether the transaction is in the public interest.  Lawmakers have no direct role in reviewing the merger that was proposed in March, but Congress, through oversight of the regulators, and by holding hearings on such deals, can influence the climate of public opinion.  Smith, whose committee oversees the Justice Department, said AT&T’s acquisition of T-Mobile from Deutsche Telekom AG had the potential to create jobs, spur innovation, enhance AT&T’s broadband network and encourage competitors to also improve their networks.  He called lawmakers’ objections to the deal one-sided and based on limited information as congressional hearings are not equipped to provide the detailed analysis required for a merger of this size.  “There is at least as much evidence in the hearing record supporting the merger as opposing it,” he said in the letter.  While Smith did not expressly endorse the merger, analysts at Stifel Nicolaus said in a note to clients, “his letter is helpful to AT&T/T-Mobile in answering the opposition of Senator (Herb) Kohl, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s antitrust subcommittee, as well as the resistance of other senior Democrats.”  Kohl sent a letter to regulators in July, saying the merger “would likely cause substantial harm to competition and consumers, would be contrary to antitrust law and not in the public interest, and therefore should be blocked.”  The merger would concentrate 80 percent of the U.S. wireless market in just two companies: AT&T/T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless, a venture of Verizon Communications and Vodafone Group Plc.  AT&T argues that the purchase of T-Mobile will help it expand faster service to more customers.  Critics charge that less competition will increase prices and limit consumer choice.

70,VZ,Broadband closer to advertised speeds: study,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Broadband speeds on average are within 80 percent of what major Internet service providers advertise, a big improvement from two years ago, according to a government study.  The Federal Communications Commission studied cable, DSL and fiber-to-the-home services at 13 top U.S. broadband providers.  The agency found Verizon Communications Inc’s fiber network was best at meeting or exceeding advertised maximum download speeds, while Cablevision Systems Corp was the worst.  Overall, the numbers were a big boost from 2009, when data indicated download speeds were often about half of Internet service providers’ (ISP) maximum advertised speeds.  “Most major ISPs are providing service close to what they’re advertising. This represents a significant improvement over the findings from two years ago when we first shined a light on this issue,” FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski said, unveiling the study’s findings at a Best Buy Co store in the District of Columbia.  During peak consumer usage hours when networks are busiest, actual download speeds varied from 114 percent to 54 percent of advertised speed among the different ISPs, the FCC said.  The report comes as the FCC is promoting its National Broadband Plan, unveiled last year. It is a blueprint for expanding coverage, making more airwaves available for mobile services and upgrading Internet speeds up to 25 times recent averages.  The complete findings of the report, its raw data and an FCC-prepared guide for consumers will be made available online. The FCC says the data will help consumers decide which Internet speed, service and provider best meet their needs.  “This report pretty well dispels the myth ... that there’s a huge gap between advertised and actual speeds, and in fact we do pretty well here in the United States,” said Richard Bennett, a senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.  Not everyone was impressed with the study’s findings.  “This study indicates Comcast, Cox and Verizon FiOS largely perform well, but other companies like Cablevision, AT&T, MediaCom and Frontier all fail to deliver their customers the quality of service promised,” said S. Derek Turner, research director for the public interest group Free Press.  Free Press said ISPs should be held to the same standard as other industries, where giving customers less than what they pay for is a serious offense.  The 13 participating ISPs in the new study included Verizon, which had its fiber and DSL services tested separately, AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp, Time Warner Cable Inc, Cox Communications, Cablevision, Frontier Communications Corp, CenturyLink Inc, Charter Communications Inc, Insight Communications Co, Mediacom Communications, Qwest Communications and Windstream Corp.

72,VZ,U.S. broadband closer to advertised speeds-study," * FCC to unveil results of national fixed broadband study   * Most ISPs within 80 percent of advertised speeds   By Jasmin Melvin   WASHINGTON, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Broadband speeds are now significantly closer to what Internet service providers advertise than they were in 2009, a study to be released by U.S. communications regulators on Tuesday found.   Cable, DSL and fiber-to-the-home services were examined at 13 top U.S. broadband providers, representing about 86 percent of all U.S. fixed broadband connections.   Actual download speeds provided by the majority of U.S. broadband providers were within 80 percent or better of companies’ advertised speeds even during peak usage hours, according to a draft copy of the report.   The findings are considerably improved from data collected in 2009 for a study on U.S. broadband performance that showed actual download speeds were more often around 50 percent of the Internet service provider’s (ISP) advertised speed, the Federal Communications Commission said.   During peak consumer usage hours when networks are most busy and experience the greatest degradation in speeds, actual download speeds varied from 114 percent of advertised speed to a low of 54 percent of advertised speed among the different ISPs, the draft report said.   The 13 participating ISPs in the new study included Verizon Communications (VZ.N), which had its fiber and DSL services tested separately, AT&T (T.N), Comcast (CMCSA.O), Time Warner TWC.N, Cox Communications, Cablevision CVC.N, Frontier FTR.N, CenturyLink (CTL.N), Charter (CHTR.O), Insight Communications Co, Mediacom Communications, Qwest Communications and Windstream (WIN.O).   Average download speeds as a percentage of those advertised were highest for Verizon’s fiber service and lowest for Cablevision.   Fiber-to-home services achieved the best speeds compared with advertised speeds during the peak hours between 7 p.m. and 11 p.m. on weeknights when residential networks tend to be most congested. They met download speeds, on average, of 114 percent of advertised speeds. Cable services met 93 percent of advertised speeds during peak hours, while DSL met 82 percent, the draft copy of the report said.   The study — a recommendation of the FCC’s National Broadband Plan — is the first to provide measurements of residential wireline broadband performance on a national level.   The complete findings of the report, its raw data and an FCC-prepared guide for consumers will be made available online, furthering the agency’s consumer empowerment agenda by helping consumers decide which Internet speed, service and provider best meets their needs, the FCC said.   “We’ve been working to arm consumers with information to help them make smart choices about the broadband service that’s right for them. Informed consumers should lead to a healthier and more competitive broadband market,” said Zachary Katz, chief counsel and senior legal adviser to FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski.   Academic researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Georgia Tech as well as technology vendors and consumer groups also worked on the study. Some 6,800 households were selected for testing with 13 different tests conducted multiple times a day over several months in each home to assess broadband performance.   Speed and performance were measured as broadband was delivered to the home, the FCC said, to eliminate the effects of equipment, home networks and other factors on test results.

73,VZ,UPDATE 3-RIM tilts at iPhone with new BlackBerry phones,"   * RIM says browser 40 percent faster than original Torch   * Touchscreens for all; faster processors, better display   * RIM stock, market share down since last phone launch   * Shares up 5 percent  (Adds analyst quote, updates with closing stock price)   By Alastair Sharp   TORONTO, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Research In Motion RIM.TO unveiled two new versions of its touchscreen BlackBerry Torch on Wednesday as it seeks to regain ground it has lost to Apple and Google with powerful consumer-friendly models.   Investors reacted favorably, pushing RIM’s deflated stock price up more than 5 percent. But some analysts were skeptical, given delays leading up to this launch. They said a radically new software package due next year would be RIM’s big test.   The new Torch models include an all-touch version that mimics the popular style of Apple’s iPhone and most Android devices. Along with a previously announced upgrade to its workhorse Bold model, they are part of what the Canadian company called the biggest global launch in its history.   “The pure touch model could be very interesting. It has some great tech in terms of computing horsepower,” said Will Stofega, a mobile device analyst at research firm IDC.   He dismissed concern that consumers would snub the devices while waiting for “superphones” due out next year using the QNX operating system that powers RIM’s PlayBook tablet and said the phones could tempt buyers away from the iPhone.   “What people seem to want is a vibrant, iconic, shiny device,” he said.   RIM has lagged its competitors in bringing out must-have phones with speedy browsers, and its PlayBook competitor to Apple’s iPad launched to dismal reviews in April.   The company is slashing 2,000 jobs to reduce costs and streamline operations after reporting a fall in quarterly profit and a dismal earnings outlook. [ID:nL3E7IP251]   It has already promised “superphones” next year using the QNX-based operating system that runs the PlayBook, so analysts are looking beyond this launch.   “This is a necessary product refresh in advance of the big bang that we hope and expect will happen with QNX-based phones,” said John Jackson, vice-president of research at CCS Insight.   The three touchscreen BlackBerrys are RIM’s most powerful yet. They run on an upgraded operating system, boast improved displays and pack a 1.2 GHz processor from Qualcomm (QCOM.O) as well as dedicated graphics processor that should make video and gaming sharper and more responsive.   RIM says the browser is 40 percent faster than the original Torch, its last major phone launch, which hit shelves almost a year ago. [ID:nLDE67301J]   “RIM’s new BlackBerry smartphones could well be the most important devices in the Canadian smart device vendor’s history, following a recent slowdown in device shipments, staff cuts and doubts over the company’s strategy and leadership,” Ovum analyst Tony Cripps said.   All three devices will be launched by carriers around the world by the end of August, RIM said. The slider Torch, with both a keyboard and a touch screen, will be exclusive to AT&T (T.N) in the United States from this month, the carrier said, while AT&T will offer the other phones later in the year.   The all-touch Torch is RIM’s first attempt at the popular style since two versions of its Storm model failed to excite.   “It’s definitely an acknowledgment that there are people that want that full-touch device,” RIM’s newly promoted global head of sales, Patrick Spence, said in a phone interview.   The timing could boost RIM’s earnings for the quarter to late August as it sells the phones to carriers. But figures for user sales won’t be available until the following quarter.   RIM shipped 13.2 million phones in the three months to late May — its first fall in shipments from a previous quarter since at least mid-2007 — as it pushed the launch of the latest products back to August.   RIM’s aging hardware and software have looked increasing outdated as manufacturers such as Motorola (MMI.N), Samsung (005930.KS) and HTC (2498.TW) push out sleek, large-screen devices using Android and its applications.   Its market share has fallen steeply in the United States, according to data compiled by research firm Gartner. The global fall has been less severe, but from a smaller starting point.   “What would constitute success for these guys is essentially holding the fort,” CCS’s Jackson said. “A stop-loss outcome would be a success for these products in developed markets.”   Shares of Waterloo, Ontario-based RIM have dropped 65 percent from their peak in February. The stock rose $1.18 to $25.33 on the Nasdaq and was up C$1.19 at C$24.42 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.   The shares closed Tuesday at their lowest level in five years.

The new phones, along with an upgrade to its Bold model shown earlier, are part of what the Canadian company called the biggest global launch in its history as it seeks to claw back North American market share from Apple’s iPhone and a slew of devices running on Google’s Android software.

Since Co-Chief Executive Mike Lazaridis has already promised “superphones” next year using the QNX-based operating system that runs RIM’s PlayBook tablet computer, analysts are looking beyond this launch.  “This is a necessary product refresh in advance of the big bang that we hope and expect will happen with QNX-based phones,” said John Jackson, vice-president of research at CCS Insight.  RIM shipped 13.2 million phones in the three months to late May, its first fall in shipments from a previous quarter since at least mid-2007, as it pushed this launch back to August.  RIM’s aging hardware and software have looked increasing outdated as manufacturers such as Motorola, Samsung and HTC push out sleek, large-touchscreen devices using Android and its extensive offering of applications.  The slider Torch looks identical to the original touchscreen device with a slideout Qwerty keyboard, but it packs more powerful insides.  The Bold upgrade includes a near-field communications (NFC) chip to turn the phone into a mobile wallet. It was first shown at RIM’s BlackBerry World conference in May.  RIM’s North American market share has fallen in the past year as high-end Android devices proliferate and U.S. carrier Verizon added Apple’s iPhone to its lineup. Globally the fall has been less severe, but from a smaller starting point, according to data compiled by research firms CCS Insight and Gartner.  U.S. sales accounted for less than 27 percent of RIM’s revenue in the most recent quarter, down from 50 percent a year earlier, as international markets picked up some of the slack.  “What would constitute success for these guys is essentially holding the fort,” CCS’s Jackson said. “A stop-loss outcome would be a success for these products in developed markets.”  Shares of Waterloo, Ontario-based RIM have dropped 65 percent from their peak in February as the company’s earnings and outlook missed expectations and its PlayBook failed to dent the iPad’s dominance of the tablet market.  The stock was up more than a dollar at $25.37 on the Nasdaq and at C$24.47 on the Toronto Stock Exchange at midday on Wednesday. It closed on Tuesday at its lowest level in five years, giving the company a market capitalization of $12.7 billion.

75,VZ,RIM launches two new BlackBerry Torch phones,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Research In Motion RIM.TO on Wednesday took the wraps off two more powerful versions of its touchscreen BlackBerry Torch, aiming to buy time until it can introduce a radically new software package in its smartphones.  The new phones, along with a Bold upgrade unveiled earlier, are part of what the Canadian company called its biggest global launch ever as it seeks to claw back North American market share losses from Apple’s (AAPL.O) iconic iPhone and a slew of devices running on Google’s (GOOG.O) Android software.  Investors reacted favorably, pushing RIM’s deflated stock price up 3 percent.  “RIM’s new BlackBerry smartphones could well be the most important devices in the Canadian smart device vendor’s history, following a recent slowdown in device shipments, staff cuts and doubts over the company’s strategy and leadership,” Ovum analyst Tony Cripps said.  The three touchscreen phones, running on the new BlackBerry OS 7, boast improved screen displays and pack a 1.2 GHz processor from Qualcomm (QCOM.O), the most powerful ever for a BlackBerry phone. All three devices will launch with carriers globally by the end of August, RIM said.  The browser is 40 percent faster than the original Torch, hit shelves almost a year ago.  But since co-chief executive Mike Lazaridis has already promised “superphones” next year using the QNX-based operating system that runs RIM’s PlayBook tablet computer, analysts are looking beyond the launch.  “This is a necessary product refresh in advance of the big bang that we hope and expect will happen with QNX-based phones,” said CCS Insight vice-president of research John Jackson.

77,VZ,"Senators cite benefits of AT&T;, T-Mobile deal","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two Republican senators urged U.S. officials to consider the benefits of AT&T Inc’s $39 billion bid to acquire Deutsche Telekom AG’s T-Mobile USA.  Mike Lee, the top Republican on the Senate’s antitrust subcommittee, and colleague John Cornyn, sent a letter to the U.S. Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission, urging them to consider all the available evidence before deciding whether the transaction should go through.  The senators cited the faster fourth generation service that AT&T has said it can rollout faster to more customers if the merger is approved. The deal could also spur handset innovation and development of new applications, the senators said in the letter dated Wednesday.  The antitrust panel’s Democratic chairman, Senator Herb Kohl, urged authorities last month to block the deal, saying there were no effective remedies that the companies could offer to stop the merger’s harm to consumers and competition.  If approved as proposed, the merger would concentrate 80 percent of the U.S. wireless market in just two companies: AT&T/T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless, a venture of Verizon Communications and Vodafone Group Plc.  AT&T argues the purchase of T-Mobile will help it expand faster service to more customers. Critics charge that less competition will increase prices and limit consumer choice.  Lee and Cornyn said the deal could be of great help to the quality of mobile broadband service in the United States, improving network capacity and increasing data speeds.  “The testimony and materials presented to the Antitrust Subcommittee highlight potential benefits to consumers that deserve meaningful attention,” they said in their letter.  Representative Lamar Smith, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, sent a similar letter earlier this week to the two government agencies.  The Justice Department is conducting an antitrust review, and the FCC is weighing whether the transaction is in the public interest.  Lawmakers have no direct role in reviewing the merger that was proposed in March, but Congress, through oversight of the regulators, and by holding hearings on such deals, can influence the climate of public opinion.  A Yankee Group study released this week said that without strong regulatory provisions to protect the public, the deal will reduce consumer choice and lead to higher prices.

The high-profile spate of hirings dealt a blow to Juniper, long considered one of Cisco’s more formidable foes. Cisco itself is grappling with a major overhaul of its own as it tries to revive flagging growth.   Shares in Juniper, which counts AT&T Inc (T.N), Verizon Communications (VZ.N) and Japan’s NTT DoCoMo (9437.T) among its customers, plunged more than 20 percent after it warned of weak third-quarter results and cuts in enterprise and public sector spending in the near term. [ID:nN1E76P240]   Juniper quickly downplayed the departures, saying its client relationships remained intact.   “Cisco’s actions reflect that Juniper continues to take share from the company,” spokesman David Shane said in an emailed statement. “We have a deep bench of sales talent and our customer relationships are not affected by the departure of a few employees.   Neal Oristano, who had headed Juniper’s Americas service-provider sales for the past 7 years, becomes Cisco’s global service-provider sales chief. Jim Labovites, who worked under Oristano, also joins the U.S. arm of that organization.   Four other Juniper executives — James Godson, Ray Testa, Tom Roberts and Dan Darrow — will also take up various positions within the same group, Cisco said in a statement.   “While we have fought hard against that team to earn our customers’ business, I have a very healthy respect for the type of growth they’ve delivered to Juniper’s service provider business,” Nick Adamo, Cisco’s global service-provider markets chief, to whom all six will report, said in a blogpost.

82,VZ,"Verizon, unions face contract deadline Saturday","   * Sides seen far apart: union   * Talks hinge on healthcare costs, pension work rules   * Workers voted to authorize a strike   * Analyst calls Verizon proposals “aggressive”   By Sinead Carew   NEW YORK, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and unions representing 45,000 of its workers were far from reaching an agreement for a new labor contract on Friday, the day before their current contract expires.   If they do not agree on a contract by midnight on Saturday night, employees belonging to the Communications Workers of America and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers could go on strike for the first time in more than a decade.   The two sides are negotiating on issues related to healthcare contributions, pension plans and work rules, according to Verizon and the CWA. But after weeks of bargaining, major hurdles remain, the union said.   Verizon is looking to keep costs in check at its wireline business, which has been declining for a decade as customers have disconnected their home phones in favor of cellphone and Internet services.   But the CWA said the company, which is one of the two biggest U.S. telephone network operators, is asking for too many concessions from the workers, who include technical and customer service employees.   “It’s probably the most extreme round of bargaining that Verizon members have seen in a number of years,” said CWA representative Candice Johnson. “Across the board Verizon is making extreme demands.”   Verizon may feel it can weather a strike better than at other times, one analyst said, given that it has completed most of its $23 billion plan to build a fiber network for its FiOS Internet and TV service. Moreover, workers face an uncertain economy and bleak job picture.   “Verizon is probably better-positioned this time round to take a strike,” said D.A. Davidson analyst Donna Jaegers, who described the company’s demands as “very aggressive.”   The last time Verizon workers went on strike was in 2000 when about 80,000 workers walked out for three weeks.   In the current negotiations, Verizon said it wants to freeze employee pension plans and replace them with an “enhanced 401(k) plan.” It also wants workers to contribute to healthcare insurance premiums, which Johnson says will increase family healthcare costs by about $6,000 a year.   Company spokesman Richard Young would not comment on specific cost increases, but said the healthcare contribution change would bring union workers in line with most of the company’s other employees.   Other issues being discussed revolve around sick days, holidays and benefits for workers injured on the job.   Verizon has 196,000 employees including its Verizon Wireless venture with Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L). About 58,000 of those workers are unionized.   Young would not comment on negotiations except to say the goal is “an agreement that balances the needs of all parties.”   “We’re confident that will happen,” he said.

84,VZ,Verizon unions strike after contract talks fail,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Almost half the workers in Verizon Communications wireline telecommunications business went on strike on Sunday as negotiations for a new labor contract failed.  The strike, involving 45,000 workers, is the first walk-out that Verizon, one of the two big U.S. telephone network operators, has faced since 2000, when about 80,000 workers went on strike for about three weeks.  Verizon and two unions — The Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers — had been in talks since late June but were still far apart when their contract expired Saturday night.  The workers who went on strike are technicians and customer support employees in the wireline unit, which provides traditional phone services to homes and businesses in the Northeast as well as high-speed Internet and FiOS television service.  The two sides were unable to agree on issues related to healthcare contributions, pension plans and work rules, according to Verizon and the CWA.  Verizon is looking to keep costs in check at its wireline business, which has been declining for a decade as customers have disconnected their home phones in favor of cellphone and Internet services.  A representative for the CWA, which represents about 35,000 of the workers, said that bargaining talks were expected to resume on Sunday while employees were told to start picketing as early as 6 a.m. EDT outside their work locations.  “A strike is a hardship for all and not to be undertaken lightly,” Jim Spellane, an IBEW spokesman said in an e-mail.  “I think that the fact that we are on strike instead of finalizing an agreement is a testimony to Verizon’s intransigence throughout the process,” Spellane said.  Michael Paleski, 45, who has worked for Verizon for 23 years, was one among the roughly 250 people gathered in front of Verizon’s Manhattan corporate headquarters, where workers walked in and out of the building to chants of, “Scab! scab! scab!” on megaphones.  The strikers were all dressed in red and had signs that read, “CWA workers on strike for middle-class jobs.”  “Nobody here wants a strike. I’m sure nobody on the other side wants a strike either. But we’re also very disappointed that the company put forward so many demands for givebacks. We feel that’s really the sticking point for us,” Paleski said.  “I have two children. I have a wife, a house and two cars. And things are not cheap these days, they’re getting more expensive for us. And that’s why we need to have the right contract structure.”  On Monday morning, thousands of striking workers will join mass picket lines and rallies at over 100 Verizon work locations across New York and New Jersey to pressure the company to back off its demands, said the CWA.  VERIZON’S BACK-UP PLAN  “As of now, talks are not taking place today. We’re always willing to talk. We’re willing to return to the bargaining table at any time,” Verizon spokesman Richard Young said in an email on Sunday afternoon.  “We’re in the process of implementing our emergency action plans,” Young added.  Verizon said late Saturday night that it had trained tens of thousands of employees, from retirees to management, to fill the role of the workers who are now on strike.  “We are confident that we have the talent and resources in place to meet the needs and demands of our customers,” Marc C. Reed, Verizon’s executive vice-president of human resources, said in a statement.  Chris King, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, played down the impact of the strike on the company.  “The wireline business is something that Verizon is less exposed to than they have ever been in the past,” King said. “They are certainly more comfortable dealing with the strike today than they were 10 years or so ago.”  King, who has a “buy” rating on Verizon, said he sees the impact limited to slower-than-usual installations.  Among the changes it is seeking, Verizon said it wants to freeze employee pension plans and replace them with an enhanced 401(k) plan.” It also wants workers to contribute to healthcare insurance premiums.  The CWA says the contributions to healthcare that Verizon wants the union members to make were unacceptable, and that increases in deductibles would make the proposed healthcare plan unaffordable.  It said the profitable company is asking for far too many concessions from affected workers, who include technical and customer service employees in Verizon’s wireline business.  Verizon has 93,000 workers in its wireline business, of whom 58,000 are unionized. Including its Verizon Wireless venture with Vodafone Group Plc, the company’s total workforce is 196,000 employees.

86,VZ,Verizon unions strike after contract expires,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Unions representing 45,000 Verizon Communications (VZ.N) workers called for a strike as negotiations failed for a new labor contract that expired at midnight on Saturday.  Verizon and the unions — The Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers - had been in talks since late June.  The workers who went on strike on Sunday are technicians and customer support employees in Verizon’s wireline business, which provides Internet and land phone lines to homes and businesses in the U.S. Northeast.  Verizon is looking to keep costs in check at its wireline business, which has been declining for a decade as customers have disconnected their home phones in favor of cellphone and Internet services.  The two sides were unable to agree on issues related to healthcare contributions, pension plans and work rules, according to Verizon and the CWA.  Verizon said it had trained tens of thousands of employees, from retirees to management, to fill the role of the workers who are now on strike.  “We are confident that we have the talent and resources in place to meet the needs and demands of our customers,” Marc C. Reed, Verizon’s executive vice-president of human resources, said in a statement.  The CWA says the contributions to healthcare that Verizon wants the union members to make were unacceptable, and that increases in deductibles would make the proposed healthcare plan unaffordable.  The unions had warned of a strike and began to mobilize support among their members in early July. Verizon did not budge from the set of changes it asked for, which the unions were demanding the company take off the table.  With only hours left under their contract late on Saturday night, both unions issued statements accusing Verizon of not “getting serious” in negotiations. The CWA, which represents 35,000 workers under contract, said all the major concessions Verizon was asking for were yet to be agreed upon.  But the CWA said the profitable company, which is one of the two big U.S. telephone network operators, is asking for far too many concessions from affected workers, who include technical and customer service employees in Verizon’s wireline business.  Among the changes it is seeking, Verizon said it wants to freeze employee pension plans and replace them with an “enhanced 401(k) plan.” It also wants workers to contribute to healthcare insurance premiums.  CWA members in July authorized union leaders to call a strike if negotiations stalled, with 91 percent of votes in favor of the strike.  Verizon has 93,000 workers in its wireline business, of whom 58,000 are unionized. Including its Verizon Wireless venture with Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L), the company’s total workforce is 196,000 employees.

88,VZ,Verizon strike tensions heighten on Day 2,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The second day of a strike by Verizon workers turned ugly after unions accused managers of injuring three workers while driving past picket lines, and the phone giant complained of a spike in network sabotage cases.  About 45,000 workers in Verizon Communications’ U.S. Northeast wireline unit, which provides traditional phone as well as high-speed Internet and FiOS television services, called a strike on Sunday after talks for a new labor contract failed.  The talks resumed on Monday. But the situation outside the negotiation room took a hostile turn.  Verizon said in a statement that some picketing workers were unlawfully blocking Verizon managers’ access to work centers.  A Communications Workers of America spokesman said he was not aware of any unlawful activity by strikers and said the union doesn’t condone such behavior.  However, the CWA said some picketing workers were hurt by Verizon managers’ cars and that one worker was knocked unconscious when he was clipped by the mirror of a manager’s car that was speeding past a picket line.  Verizon said it was working with the police to investigate what happened, but noted that it believed the allegations are “totally inaccurate.”  The CWA also cited a case in which a security guard hired by Verizon had punched a worker and knocked him to the ground on Monday morning. Verizon did not have an immediate comment on this accusation.  Meanwhile, the company said it was working with authorities to investigate at least 12 cases of sabotage, including deliberate cutting of fiber optic lines in 10 places and a case of stolen equipment that caused an outage.  Verizon said it did not know who was responsible for the sabotage, but noted an unusually high number of incidents since Saturday, the last day of the contract. The CWA said it would not condone network sabotage.  Meanwhile, Verizon said customers were seeing minimal impact as managers drafted in to cover for the striking workers were able to handle 75 percent of repair jobs on Sunday.  Verizon is looking to keep costs in check at the wireline business, which has been declining for a decade as customers have disconnected their home phones in favor of cellphone and Internet services.  The CWA and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers have rejected Verizon’s proposals to cut pensions, change work rules and make employees pay more for healthcare.  Verizon closed 5.5 percent lower at $33.12 on the New York Stock Exchange, but still fared better than the broader market. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index ended down 6.66 percent after a U.S. debt downgrade spooked investors.  Verizon has been in contract talks with both unions since late June but the unions called a strike on Sunday night after they were unable to reach an agreement by the time the existing labor contract expired.  Verizon spokesman Richard Young said the company’s last strike lasted 18 days in 2000 and cost it $40 million.  Chris King, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said in a research note on Monday that this strike would not be as costly since the company’s wireline business has shrunk since 2000.  King estimated the daily costs of the strike would be between $1 million and $2 million. King, who has a “buy” rating on Verizon, said he expects slower-than-usual installations.  Analysts said Verizon shares may have outperformed the market on Monday because the telecommunications sector is seen as a relatively safe haven. They saw the strike as a vital opportunity for the company to push for lower costs in its wireline business.  Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett said Verizon could lose some customers at least in the short term due to the strike, to cable rivals such as Cablevision Systems, Comcast Corp, or Time Warner Cable.  “This is medicine they need to take to get this business on a stable footing,” said Moffett who calculated that Verizon’s roughly 1.6 percent return on capital investments pales in comparison to its roughly 7.5 percent cost of capital.  If customers hear of a delay in service installations at Verizon they would likely call a rival instead, he said. “The longer (the strike) goes on the bigger a problem it becomes.”  Verizon shares closed off $1.93, or 5.5 percent, at $33.12, and rival AT&T fell $1.23, or 4.25 percent, to $27.70, both on the NYSE.

91,VZ,"Oracle, other companies ""punkd"" in hacking contest","LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - A weekend contest at the world’s largest hacking convention in Las Vegas showed one reason why big corporations seem to be such easy prey for cyber criminals: their workers are poorly trained in security.  Amid a spate of high-profile cyber assaults on targets ranging from Sony Corp to the International Monetary Fund, one would think that many companies would be paying special attention to security these days.  But hackers taking part in the competition on Friday and Saturday found it ridiculously easy in some cases to trick employees at some of the largest U.S. companies to reveal information that can be used in planning cyber attacks against them.  The contestants also managed to get employees to use their corporate computers to browse websites the hackers suggested. Had these been criminal hackers, the websites could have loaded malicious software onto the PCs.  In one case, a contestant pretended to work for a company’s IT department and persuaded an employee to give him information on the configuration of her PC, data that could help a hacker decide what type of malware would work best in an attack.  “For me it was a scary call because she was so willing to comply,” said Chris Hadnagy, one of the organizers of the contest at the Defcon conference in Las Vegas.  “A lot of this could facilitate serious attacks if used by the right people,” Hadnagy said.  Defcon is organized by benevolent hackers, partly to promote research on security vulnerabilities in order to pressure companies to fix them. The contest was sponsored by so-called white-hat hackers to show companies how weak their security is and encourage them to better educate their employees about the risks of hacking.  The company whose employees handed over the most data was Oracle Corp, according to Hadnagy. One of the world’s largest software makers, Oracle got its start more than 30 years ago by selling secure databases to the Central Intelligence Agency.  Oracle spokeswoman Deborah Hellinger declined comment.  Other targets included Apple Inc, AT&T Inc, ConAgra Foods Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc, Symantec Corp, Sysco Corp, United Continental Holdings Inc’s United Airlines and Verizon Communications Inc.  It was the second year that Defcon held a contest in “social engineering,” or the practice where hackers con people into handing over information or taking actions such as downloading malicious software.  Social engineering is frequently used in attacks where the hackers send a “spear phishing” e-mail in which they impersonate a friend of the recipient and ask him or her to open a tainted file or visit a malicious website.  Security experts say spear phishing have led to many hacks over the past year, including ones on U.S. defense contractors, the IMF, EMC Corp’s RSA Security division and government agencies around the world.  “It’s better whenever you can get data non-confrontationally,” said Johnny Long, a consultant who companies hire to hack into their data networks, using tools such as social engineering, to identify weaknesses.  The contestants were charged with obtaining specific information from their targets, including information about how the company backs up and secures its data, wireless network use, and the names of companies that provide on-site security, toner and copier paper.

92,VZ,UPDATE 4-Verizon unions strike after contract talks fail,"   * 45,000 employees on strike	   * Healthcare benefits, pension plans divisive	   * Verizon trained employees to fill strikers’ roles	   * Analyst plays down impact of strike on company	  (Adds comments from CEO’s letter)	   By Roy Strom, Sinead Carew and Dhanya Skariachan	   NEW YORK, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Almost half the workers in Verizon Communications’ wireline telecommunications business went on strike on Sunday as negotiations for a new labor contract failed.	   The strike, involving 45,000 workers, is the first walk-out that Verizon, one of the two big U.S. telephone network operators, has faced since 2000, when about 80,000 workers went on strike for about three weeks.	   Verizon and two unions — The Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers — had been in talks since late June but were still far apart when their contract expired Saturday night.	   The workers who went on strike are technicians and customer support employees in the wireline unit, which provides traditional phone services to homes and businesses in the Northeast as well as high-speed Internet and FiOS television service.	   The two sides were unable to agree on issues related to healthcare contributions, pension plans and work rules, according to Verizon and the CWA.	   Verizon is looking to keep costs in check at its wireline business, which has been declining for a decade as customers have disconnected their home phones in favor of cellphone and Internet services.	   A representative for the CWA, which represents about 35,000 of the workers, said bargaining talks were expected to resume on Sunday while employees were told to start picketing as early as 6 a.m. EDT (1000 GMT) outside their work locations.	   “A strike is a hardship for all and not to be undertaken lightly,” Jim Spellane, an IBEW spokesman said in an e-mail.	   “I think that the fact that we are on strike instead of finalizing an agreement is a testimony to Verizon’s intransigence throughout the process,” Spellane said.	   Michael Paleski, 45, who has worked for Verizon for 23 years, was one among the roughly 250 people gathered in front of Verizon’s Manhattan corporate headquarters, where workers walked in and out of the building to chants of, “Scab! scab! scab!” on megaphones.	   The strikers were all dressed in red and had signs that read, “CWA workers on strike for middle-class jobs.”	   “Nobody here wants a strike. I’m sure nobody on the other side wants a strike either. But we’re also very disappointed that the company put forward so many demands for givebacks. We feel that’s really the sticking point for us,” Paleski said.	   “I have two children. I have a wife, a house and two cars. And things are not cheap these days, they’re getting more expensive for us. And that’s why we need to have the right contract structure.”	   On Monday morning, thousands of striking workers will join mass picket lines and rallies at over 100 Verizon work locations across New York and New Jersey to pressure the company to back off its demands, said the CWA.	   VERIZON’S BACK-UP PLAN	   In a letter on Sunday, Verizon’s CEO Lowell McAdam asked the company’s union-represented employees to help on a number of issues to further reduce Verizon’s wireline cost structure while maintaining overall compensation and benefits.	   McAdam, who took the reins as president and CEO of Verizon on Aug. 1, said the changes that Verizon is requesting are in line with what the CWA has already agreed to with other sector peers.	   He also pointed to cable competitors suggesting that they are not bound by contract constraints, which has allowed them to be “more nimble and flexible meeting customer needs.”	   “As the U.S. automobile industry found out a few years ago, failure to make needed adjustments — when the need for change is obvious — can be catastrophic,” McAdam wrote.	   “As of now, talks are not taking place today. We’re always willing to talk. We’re willing to return to the bargaining table at any time,” Verizon spokesman Richard Young said in an email on Sunday afternoon.	   “We’re in the process of implementing our emergency action plans,” Young added.	   Verizon said late Saturday night that it had trained tens of thousands of employees, from retirees to management, to fill the role of the workers who are now on strike.	   “We are confident that we have the talent and resources in place to meet the needs and demands of our customers,” Marc C. Reed, Verizon’s executive vice-president of human resources, said in a statement.	   Chris King, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, played down the impact of the strike on the company.	   “The wireline business is something that Verizon is less exposed to than they have ever been in the past,” King said.	   “They are certainly more comfortable dealing with the strike today than they were 10 years or so ago.”	   King, who has a “buy” rating on Verizon, said he sees the impact limited to slower-than-usual installations.

94,VZ,Verizon seeks injunctions against strikers,"WILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc has sought court injunctions to prevent striking workers from blocking access to the company’s facilities, a spokesman said on the third day of a strike involving almost half of the company’s wireline employees.  Two unions representing 45,000 workers called a strike on Sunday after a labor contract expired and several weeks of talks for a new contract failed.  Verizon has sought injunctions to prevent “illegal” and “reprehensible” strike activities such as keeping managers out of buildings, according to company spokesman Rich Young.  Verizon got an injunction in Pennsylvania and filed for one in Delaware, according to Young, who said the company would seek injunctions in any state where strikers block buildings.  While the company and the unions are still holding high-level talks, the injunctions are the latest sign of increasingly hostile relations outside the negotiating room. The Communications Workers of America has accused Verizon managers of injuring picketers.  A spokeswoman for the CWA, representing about 35,000 of the strikers, declined to comment on the injunctions on Tuesday and said there was no update from the talks. The union said on Monday that it did not condone illegal activity.  On a picket line in Brooklyn, New York, Hector Soto, 47, said union members picketing there were not blocking managers from entering the building to work.  “We’re not stopping them physically, but we’re letting them know they’re scabs,” said Soto, a shop steward and customer care representative for Verizon business clients.  “We’re doing what we legally can do, which is protest,” Soto said. Minutes later picketers could be heard yelling “scab.”  The strikers are technical workers and customer service representatives for Verizon’s U.S. northeast and mid-Atlantic wireline unit, which provides phone, high-speed Internet and television services.  Verizon is looking to cut costs in its wireline business, which has been declining for years as customers get rid of home phones in favor of cellphones and Internet services.  But the unions say the company is asking for too many concessions in areas such as healthcare contributions, pensions, sick days and other work rules.  Verizon said it sent an update on Tuesday to lawmakers in the nine states affected by the strike and to leadership in the House and Senate and to Labor committees.  The statement reiterates the company’s stance on issues such the need to reduce benefits, which it says total about $50,000 on average per employee.

95,VZ,UPDATE 3-Verizon seeks injunctions against strikers," * Verizon says granted injunction in Pennsylvania   * Seeks injunctions in other places, updates lawmakers   * Workers strike for a third day   * Verizon shares close up 3.5 pct  (Adds Verizon comment, closing share price)   WILMINGTON, Del., Aug 9 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) has sought court injunctions to prevent striking workers from blocking access to the company’s facilities, a spokesman said on the third day of a strike involving almost half of the company’s wireline employees.   Two unions representing 45,000 workers called a strike on Sunday after a labor contract expired and several weeks of talks for a new contract failed.   Verizon has sought injunctions to prevent “illegal” and “reprehensible” strike activities such as keeping managers out of buildings, according to company spokesman Rich Young.   Verizon got an injunction in Pennsylvania and filed for one in Delaware, according to Young, who said the company would seek injunctions in any state where strikers block buildings.   While the company and the unions are still holding high-level talks, the injunctions are the latest sign of increasingly hostile relations outside the negotiating room. The Communications Workers of America has accused Verizon managers of injuring picketers. [ID:nN1E7770IO]   A spokeswoman for the CWA, representing about 35,000 of the strikers, declined to comment on the injunctions on Tuesday and said there was no update from the talks. The union said on Monday that it did not condone illegal activity.   On a picket line in Brooklyn, New York, Hector Soto, 47, said union members picketing there were not blocking managers from entering the building to work.   “We’re not stopping them physically, but we’re letting them know they’re scabs,” said Soto, a shop steward and customer care representative for Verizon business clients.   “We’re doing what we legally can do, which is protest,” Soto said. Minutes later picketers could be heard yelling “scab.”   The strikers are technical workers and customer service representatives for Verizon’s U.S. northeast and mid-Atlantic wireline unit, which provides phone, high-speed Internet and television services.   Verizon is looking to cut costs in its wireline business, which has been declining for years as customers get rid of home phones in favor of cellphones and Internet services.   But the unions say the company is asking for too many concessions in areas such as healthcare contributions, pensions, sick days and other work rules.   Verizon said it sent an update on Tuesday to lawmakers in the nine states affected by the strike and to leadership in the House and Senate and to Labor committees.   The statement reiterates the company’s stance on issues such the need to reduce benefits, which it says total about $50,000 on average per employee.   It also argued that the CWA had agreed to similar changes with other companies such as AT&T Inc (T.N). The company said it spends $4 billion a year on healthcare for its employees. It has 196,000 employees including its wireless venture.   The company argued that employees need to work with it to adjust rules and policies in order or it to remain competitive in its Internet business.   “This is hard, but it is doable,” Verizon said.

96,VZ,UPDATE 1-US regulators link reviews of AT&T;'s transactions," * AT&T’s proposed deals to undergo coordinated FCC review   * FCC stops clock on review of Qualcomm deal  (Adds comments from analysts and AT&T)   By Jasmin Melvin   WASHINGTON, Aug 9 (Reuters) - AT&T Inc’s (T.N) $1.9 billion offer for some of Qualcomm Inc’s (QCOM.O) wireless licenses will be tied to a simultaneous review of AT&T’s $39 billion proposed takeover of T-Mobile USA, U.S. communications regulators said in a letter sent late on Monday.   The Federal Communications Commission, citing the many related issues, dropped the agency’s informal 180-day timeline for review of the Qualcomm deal.   The move could significantly delay completion of the smaller Qualcomm deal because the review of AT&T’s bid for Deutsche Telekom AG’s (DTEGn.DE) T-Mobile is expected to extend at least into the first quarter of 2012.   Qualcomm said swift action on its deal was in line with the FCC’s goal to free up more airwaves for mobile broadband use.   The company said the deal would not only re-purpose unused spectrum for wireless Internet services, but it would also allow it to invest and deploy more spectrum efficient technology.   “The FCC should approve the pending AT&T-Qualcomm spectrum sale now because of the clear benefits to the public from the sale that stand on their own and are totally unrelated to the proposed AT&T-T-Mobile merger,” Dean Brenner, vice president of government affairs for Qualcomm, said in a statement.   But the FCC said it was concerned about AT&T amassing spectrum across the country, especially in overlapping areas, among other issues.   “We have concluded that the best way to determine whether either or both of the proposed transactions serve the public interest is to consider them in a coordinated manner at this time,” the FCC’s Wireless Telecommunications Bureau said in a letter to AT&T and Qualcomm.   The decision does not prevent the agency from considering the deals separately at a later date.   An AT&T spokesman said the company is hopeful the Qualcomm deal could still be resolved ahead of the merger.   However, Stifel Nicolaus analysts said in a research note that a decision on the Qualcomm deal will likely not be made until review of the T-Mobile merger nears or is completed.   The FCC is weighing whether the proposed merger with T-Mobile is in the public interest, while the Justice Department is conducting an antitrust review.   If approved as proposed, the merger would concentrate 80 percent of the U.S. wireless market in just two companies: AT&T/T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless, a venture of Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L).   AT&T argues the purchase of T-Mobile will help it expand faster service to more customers. Critics charge that less competition will increase prices and limit consumer choice.   Public interest groups, including the Consumers Union, Free Press, the Media Access Project, Public Knowledge and the New America Foundation, asked the FCC in April to link the reviews of AT&T’s transactions, saying the deals would “further empower an already dominant wireless carrier to leverage its control over devices, backhaul, and consumers in ways that stifle competition.”   AT&T has said U.S. government remedies to free up more U.S. airwaves for wireless services are not coming fast enough and were an important driver behind its plans to acquire T-Mobile.   AT&T estimates it will carry the equivalent of the volume of all the mobile traffic it handled last year in just the first six or seven weeks of 2015, as explosive demand continues for wireless devices such as Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) iPhone.   A spectrum shortage would mean clogged networks, more dropped calls and slower connection speeds for wireless customers.

97,VZ,Dish Network misses Street and loses subscribers,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Dish Network Corp’s quarterly profit fell short of Wall Street estimates as the satellite TV provider’s subscribers defected to cheaper plans offered by phone companies.  The company also shed some light on its plans to unite its disparate group of assets. Led by its chairman, billionaire Charlie Ergen, the company has bought video store chain Blockbuster and companies with wireless spectrum such as DBSD and TerreStar in recent months.  On the conference call, Dish Chief Executive Joe Clayton said the company would consider offering broadband services, but provided no specifics.  “We’re a video pay TV company, so video is our primary objective as we go forward. But, you know, we’re also very interested in wireless broadband,” he said.  The executive told analysts the company was keeping its options open and its long-term strategy could include “additional acquisitions, partnerships, alliances, or even parting with assets that might not prove to be strategic going forward.”  For now, Dish said it had to deal with a tough environment in pay TV, where Verizon Communications and AT&T are offering aggressive discounts to lure subscribers from Dish and its rival DirecTV, as well as the cable companies.  Plus, some subscribers dropped their pay TV service in favor of cheaper online alternatives such as Netflix, a practice called cord-cutting.  “A resurrection of the cord-cutting thesis seems almost inevitable here,” said Bernstein Research’s Craig Moffett in a note. “Rising prices for pay TV, coupled with growing availability of lower cost alternatives, add to a toxic mix at a time when disposable income isn’t growing.”  Dish lost 135,000 net subscribers to end the quarter with  14.1 million subscribers.  Last week, its main rival DirecTV added 26,000 subscribers, less than half the number analyst expected as phone companies such as Verizon gained traction with its TV services.  Dish showed improvement in its monthly churn rate, a measure of customer losses, which fell to 1.67 percent from 1.78 percent for the year-ago period.  Brean Murray analyst Todd Mitchell said that was a sign the company was retaining its subscribers better.  In the past, Dish had cut its prices aggressively to add subscribers, hurting its revenue and profits. In recent quarters, it raised its prices, which is improving its average revenue per customer, but hurting its subscriber additions.  “If we do this smartly, I think we can... force the customer to move up to better packages, and that’s our focus with our new advertising and our new commercial offers,” CEO Clayton said.  Dish’s average revenue per customer rose to $78.06 from $73.05 last year.  The second-largest U.S. satellite TV provider posted net income of $335 million, or 75 cents per share, which missed Wall Street estimates of 79 cents a share according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  A year earlier, it earned $275 million, or 57 cents a share.  Revenue increased 13 percent to $3.59 billion, topping the average Wall Street estimate of $3.41 billion.  Dish’s revenue from equipment and merchandise sales rose sharply. This was driven by Blockbuster, which rents and sells movies and video games.  Despite the revenue boost, Brean Murray’s Mitchell sees the Blockbuster acquisition as the long-term drag on Dish.  “I doubt Blockbuster will be as profitable as Dish because it’s a retail business,” he said.  In July, Dish announced that Blockbuster would keep the majority of its stores open.  On Tuesday, Dish’s sister company EchoStar, which makes digital set-top boxes, and posted its second-quarter results.

103,VZ,Verizon strike tensions heighten on Day 2,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The second day of a strike by Verizon workers turned ugly after union representatives accused managers of injuring three workers while driving past picket lines, and the phone giant complained of a spike in network sabotage cases.  About 45,000 workers in Verizon Communications’ Northeast wireline unit, which provides traditional phone as well as high-speed Internet and FiOS television services, called a strike on Sunday after talks for a new labor contract failed.  The talks resumed on Monday. But the situation outside the negotiation room took a hostile turn.  Verizon complained of network sabotage cases in the same statement where it said some picketing workers were unlawfully blocking Verizon managers’ access to work centers.  A spokeswoman for the Communications Workers of America, representing 35,000 of the strikers, said the union “does not condone illegal action of any kind.” The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, representing 10,000 strikers, also said members “are expected to obey the law.”  However, the CWA said some picketing workers were hurt by Verizon managers’ cars and that one worker was knocked unconscious when he was clipped by the mirror of a manager’s car that was speeding past a picket line.  Verizon said it was working with the police to investigate what happened, but noted that it believed the allegations are “totally inaccurate.”  The CWA also cited a case in which a security guard hired by Verizon had punched a worker and knocked him to the ground on Monday morning. Verizon did not have an immediate comment on this accusation.  Meanwhile, the company said it was working with authorities to investigate at least 12 cases of sabotage, including deliberate cutting of fiber optic lines in 10 places and a case of stolen equipment that caused an outage.  Verizon said it did not know who was responsible for the sabotage, but noted an unusually high number of incidents since Saturday, the last day of the contract. The CWA said it would not condone network sabotage.  Meanwhile, Verizon said customers were seeing minimal impact as managers drafted in to cover for the striking workers were able to handle 75 percent of repair jobs on Sunday.  Verizon is looking to keep costs in check at the wireline business, which has been declining for a decade as customers have disconnected their home phones in favor of cellphone and Internet services.  The CWA and IBEW have rejected Verizon’s proposals to cut pensions, change work rules and make employees pay more for healthcare.  Verizon closed 5.5 percent lower at $33.12 on the New York Stock Exchange, but still fared better than the broader market. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index ended down 6.66 percent after a U.S. debt downgrade spooked investors.  Verizon has been in contract talks with both unions since late June but the unions called a strike on Sunday night after they were unable to reach an agreement by the time the existing labor contract expired.  Verizon spokesman Richard Young said the company’s last strike lasted 18 days in 2000 and cost it $40 million.  Chris King, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said in a research note on Monday that this strike would not be as costly since the company’s wireline business has shrunk since 2000.  King estimated the daily costs of the strike would be between $1 million and $2 million. King, who has a “buy” rating on Verizon, said he expects slower-than-usual installations.  Analysts said Verizon shares may have outperformed the market on Monday because the telecommunications sector is seen as a relatively safe haven. They saw the strike as a vital opportunity for the company to push for lower costs in its wireline business.  Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett said Verizon could lose some customers at least in the short term due to the strike, to cable rivals such as Cablevision Systems, Comcast Corp, or Time Warner Cable.  “This is medicine they need to take to get this business on a stable footing,” said Moffett who calculated that Verizon’s roughly 1.6 percent return on capital investments pales in comparison to its roughly 7.5 percent cost of capital.  If customers hear of a delay in service installations at Verizon they would likely call a rival instead, he said. “The longer (the strike) goes on the bigger a problem it becomes.”  Verizon shares closed off $1.93, or 5.5 percent, at $33.12, and rival AT&T fell $1.23, or 4.25 percent, to $27.70, both on the NYSE.

But Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said that returns from the new service will be limited.  “Let’s face it, the FiOS cost structure will never be as profitable as the legacy wireline structure,” Shammo said during the Webcast of an analyst meeting on Wednesday.  Shammo cited fierce competition in the TV market as well as high-fees for digital content as reasons why FiOS will not be as profitable as its legacy service.  Last summer, the company shut off its copper-based service for about 300 customers in Texas and replaced it with FiOS, a company spokesman said.  Shammo said the company will continue to cut off its copper-based service in smaller markets that have high rates of FiOS subscribers.  Verizon is looking into doing this in Wesley Chapel, Florida, a rural town outside Tampa Bay, a spokesman said.  Shammo said the dynamics of the TV market means its wireline business needs a “fundamental cost change.”  The company’s attempts to lower costs have crystallized as a strike by almost half of its wireline workforce.  On Sunday, 45,000 workers from the U.S. Northeast went on strike, saying that Verizon’s proposed contract asked for too many concessions in healthcare contributions, pensions, sick days and other work rules.  Shammo said the cable market that Verizon is now competing in doesn’t give its employees similar benefits, putting Verizon at a disadvantage.  Shammo also said that Verizon might be moving its trial of a prepaid unlimited data plan for $50 per month from its two trial markets.  “The trial has gone very, very well for us,” he said. “You may see us take that in a few other markets.”  Shammo said the prepaid plan had not taken service from its customers under contract. The company did not want its prepaid plans competing with its “crown jewel” contract plans, Shammo said.  Michael Nelson, an analyst at Mizuho Securities, said the prepaid plan, which typically sells to a lower-income market, should not impact Verizon’s contract business.  “Verizon Wireless really does have premium pricing for their post-paid service,” Nelson said. “Arguably, prepaid is a segment outside of their existing subscriber base.”  Shares of Verizon closed down 1.8 percent at $33.66.

106,VZ,UPDATE 4-Verizon seeks injunctions against strikers," * Workers strike for a third day   * Verizon says granted injunction in Pennsylvania   * Seeks injunctions in other places, updates lawmakers   * Union reports 23 striker/vehicle incidents  (Adds union comment on injuries, Verizon response)   By Tom Hals and Sinead Carew   WILMINGTON, Del./NEW YORK, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) sought court injunctions to prevent striking workers from blocking access to its buildings as tensions escalated in the third day of a strike involving almost half of the company’s wireline employees.   Two unions representing 45,000 workers called a strike on Sunday when a labor contract expired and talks for a new contract failed after several weeks of negotiations.   While the two sides say they are still holding talks, the injunctions are just one sign of increasingly hostile relations outside the negotiating room. The Communications Workers of America, representing 35,000 workers, also has accused Verizon managers of injuring picketers. [ID:nN1E7770IO]   Verizon has sought injunctions to prevent “illegal” and “reprehensible” strike activities such as keeping managers covering for the striking workers out of buildings, according to company spokesman Rich Young.   Verizon said it received an injunction in Pennsylvania, filed for one in Delaware and vowed to seek injunctions in any state where strikers block buildings.   The unions said in a joint statement on Tuesday that they did not condone violence of any kind and that they expected their members to follow the law.   Meanwhile the CWA said on Tuesday evening that it had received 23 reports of incidents where striking workers were hit or were narrowly missed by vehicles driven by Verizon managers or non-union contractors.   Young denied the accusations and said that “In some cases, union picketers are standing or throwing themselves in front of our vehicles.”   Young referred to an Internet video where a person in a red shirt had a young lady, presumed to be his daughter, stand in front of a truck to stop it. A CWA representative declined comment on the video and Reuters could not verify its origin.   On a picket line in Brooklyn, New York, Hector Soto, 47, said union members picketing there were not blocking managers from entering the building to work.   “We’re not stopping them physically, but we’re letting them know they’re scabs,” said Soto, a shop steward and customer care representative for Verizon business clients.   “We’re doing what we legally can do, which is protest,” Soto said. Minutes later picketers could be heard yelling “scab.”   The strikers are technical workers and customer service representatives for Verizon’s U.S. northeast and mid-Atlantic wireline unit, which provides telephone and high-speed Internet services for homes and businesses as well as Verizon’s FiOS television services.   Verizon is looking to cut costs in its wireline business, which has been declining for years as customers get rid of home phones in favor of cellphones and Internet services.   But the unions say the company is asking for too many concessions in areas such as healthcare contributions, pensions, sick days and other work rules.   Verizon said it sent an update on Tuesday to lawmakers in the nine states affected by the strike and to leadership in the House and Senate and to Labor committees.   The statement reiterates the company’s stance on issues such the need to reduce benefits, which it says total about $50,000 on average per employee.   It also argued that the CWA had agreed to similar changes with other companies such as AT&T Inc (T.N). The company said it spends $4 billion a year on healthcare for its employees. It has 196,000 employees including its wireless venture.   The company argued that employees need to work with it to adjust rules and policies in order for it to remain competitive in its Internet business.   “This is hard, but it is doable,” Verizon said.   While the strike does not involve employees in Verizon Wireless, Verizon’s venture with Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L), some workers were picketing outside Verizon Wireless stores in New York on Tuesday. The wireless business depends on wired connections between wireless cell towers.   The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers represents 10,000 of the striking workers.   Verizon shares finished up $1.17 at $34.29 on New York Stock Exchange, in a broad market rally.

110,VZ,"Verizon gets picket injunctions in 3 states, seeks more"," * Obtains New York, Delaware, Pennsylvania injunctions   * Seeks New Jersey, Mass. injunctions   * Legal moves may foretell long strike-lawyer   NEW YORK, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications (VZ.N) won court injunctions in three states to prevent strikers from blocking facilities and it was seeking similar legal protection in two more states on the fifth day of a strike involving almost half the workers in its wireline business.   Two unions representing 45,000 workers had called a strike Sunday after a labor contract expired and several weeks of talks for a new contract failed.   By Thursday afternoon Verizon said it had been granted injunctions in New York and Delaware as well as Pennsylvania after it accused picketers of illegally blocking garages and work entrances. It also went to court on Thursday to seek injunctions for Massachusetts and New Jersey.   The injunctions limit the number of people who can picket at each location and how close they can stand to building entrances to reduce the chances of them blocking managers from going into the buildings to cover for the strikers.   While both sides continue to hold talks, the strike turned into a nasty public fight almost immediately after it started.   Verizon complained about network sabotage and strikers blocking workers while the unions accused Verizon managers of injuring picketers with their work vehicles on day two.   But the company’s move to secure injunctions so soon into the strike could mean it is expecting the strike to drag on for some time, according to one lawyer who has helped companies with labor negotiations in the past.   “If they thought it was going to be over soon (or) if it wasn’t putting economic pressure on them, why go for the injunction?” said John Hancock a Detroit-based lawyer for Butzel Long. “I think they’re preparing for the long term and it may be having some impact on them.”   The Communications Workers of America, which represents about 35,000 of the strikers, said the injunctions would not make much difference to their ability to picket effectively.   “We will continue to be able to conduct a militant strike,” said CWA spokesman Robert Master.   Meanwhile, at least one rival Towerstream Corp TWER.O, a small wireless broadband provider, is hoping to take advantage of Verizon’s woes. It put out a statement on Thursday offering to waive certain fees for Verizon business customers looking to switch to its service to avoid installation delays.

114,VZ,Verizon strike should slow NYC deal: City officials,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York City education panel should delay voting on a $120 million contract with Verizon Communications Inc until the telephone company agrees to a new contract for 45,000 striking workers, two city officials said on Wednesday.  In making the recommendation, Democratic City Comptroller John Liu became the first city politician to pressure Verizon to settle the strike, which began on August 7 after negotiations for a new contract failed.  New York City’s Public Advocate Bill de Blasio, also called for a delay of the vote the day after Verizon said it started warning employees their healthcare benefits would end on August 31 if they are still on strike.  More than half the workers in Verizon’s wireline business, which provides Internet, telephone and television services, walked out after their unions said the company was asking for too many concessions in areas such as healthcare and pensions.  New York City’s Panel for Education Policy plans to vote on Wednesday on whether to let the city Department of Education allocate a $120 million contract to Telesector Resources Group, which is part of Verizon, Liu said.  “No city agency should take sides in a disagreement between labor and management and a ‘yes’ vote would equate to a validation of Verizon’s demands,” Comptroller John Liu said in a statement. “Instead, the suitable action would be to wait until an agreement is reached.”  A Verizon representative said Liu’s call was a “short-term event” that would have no impact on Verizon’s “ability to fulfill the City’s communications needs.”  “This contract would mean additional work for the currently striking workers,” spokesman John Bonomo said.  Verizon technicians and customer service representatives, have gone on strike in nine northeast and mid-Atlantic states and Washington, DC, at a time when governors and mayors around the nation are pressuring unionized public workers to accept cost-saving concessions ranging from wage freezes to higher pension contributions — or risk layoffs.  The city’s pension funds own Verizon shares so the city comptroller also could use the clout these holdings give him to turn the heat up further on Verizon.  Liu’s spokesman was not immediately available to comment.  De Blasio said the Department of Education should “immediately develop an alternate plan to provide schools with wireless services.”  The full contract is estimated at $175 million and could include other agencies, Liu said. Verizon is expected to report revenue of $110.8 billion for 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Bargaining continued on Wednesday between the company and the Communications Workers of America (CWA) and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW).  Analysts said it was not immediately clear if the politician’s moves would affect the bargaining, but one noted the strike would likely have an economic impact on Verizon as managers try to cover for striking workers.  “There’ll be some charges they have to take. There’ll be overtime they’ll have to pay their managers and customer installations will probably be down,” said Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Larsen, but he said there would likely be a “longer term benefit” for the company.  Spokesmen for Mayor Michael Bloomberg, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, whose state is one of the nine with striking Verizon workers, had no immediate comment.  Part of the New York City comptroller’s job includes “registering” contracts and Liu said he did so in May. Liu did not say whether he could cancel that action or otherwise block the contract.

118,VZ,Verizon workers to lose health coverage August 31,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications (VZ.N) is sending its 45,000 striking workers notice that their health insurance benefits will expire at the end of the month if they are not back at work.  The company said on Tuesday that it has started to send out letters to the strikers in response to questions about how healthcare coverage will be affected by the strike, which started on August 7.  The Communications Workers of America (CWA) and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) called a strike after they failed to reach a labor agreement with the company after their contract expired.  Their disagreements hinge on areas such as healthcare contributions, pensions and work rules, according to both sides.  CWA spokeswoman Candice Johnson said the union would “set up a plan and make sure striking workers’ healthcare needs are met” if the workers are still striking by August 31.  Both Verizon and CWA said that talks with the company were still going on but neither side was able to say whether they had an agreement in sight.  Verizon spokesman Rich Young said the company had “made some progress on certain issues and some issues are still up for discussion.” He did not give details.  If they are still on strike the workers, which include technicians and customer service representatives, could pay for their current health insurance plans, he said.  This would cost them about $4,800 to $10,000 per year for individual plans or $10,000 to $20,000 for family plans, Young said.

120,VZ,UPDATE 1-Connecticut unionized workers OK labor contract-Gov," (Recasts, adds details, comments)   NEW YORK, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Connecticut’s unionized state workers ratified a new cost-cutting contract, accepting bigger penalties for retiring early and agreeing to help pay for healthcare, just four days before thousands of lay-offs would have taken effect, the governor said on Thursday.   “The real value of this agreement lies in the $21.5 billion it will save taxpayers over the next 20 years in the form of lower healthcare and retirement costs for state employees,” Governor Dannel Malloy, a Democrat, said in a statement.   “When you negotiate in a respectful manner real fundamental change is possible,” he said in a webcast news conference.   Malloy parted company with many of his governor peers by closing the state’s big deficit with tax hikes, in addition to spending cuts.   Under the new contract, Connecticut public workers will have to work longer and be older to retire, wait 10 years instead of five to get retiree health benefits, and make a 3 percent contribution to a health care trust for a decade.   State employees hired after July 1 will not get longevity payments, will have to work 15 years to qualify for retiree health benefits and their pensions will be based on their last five years of service instead of the highest-earning three years.   Saying Connecticut’s government still has too many layers, Malloy said there could be more agency consolidations.   Some lawmakers have doubted that the contract will succeed in closing a $1.6 billion budget gap. Some recalculations will be needed because the contract was approved later than expected, he said, adding: “We will spell out over time how we are reaching those savings.”   In June, the 45,000-strong State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition rejected the same labor contract. The 15-member group responded by relaxing its rules to make it easier for members to approve the accord. A union spokesman was not available to comment.   Malloy — who had threatened even more draconian budget cuts if the contract was again spurned — said Connecticut’s politicians could never again put the state’s finances in peril by approving overly generous pay and benefit packages, noting the state would follow the strict Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

122,VZ,"REFILE-UPDATE 3-Verizon strike to end, talks to continue"," * Verizon, unions agree on negotiating framework   * Workers to go back starting on Monday night   * Talks to resume next week, expected to take time  (Refiles to add missing word in first paragraph)   By Sinead Carew   NEW YORK, Aug 20 (Reuters) - About 45,000 Verizon Communications (VZ.N) employees are set to end a two-week strike and return to work by Tuesday after the telephone company and unions said they reached an agreement to resume bargaining.   Almost half of the workers in Verizon’s wireline business went on strike on Aug. 7 after talks for a new labor pact failed when their contract expired.   Under the latest agreement, reached early on Saturday morning, Verizon promised to extend the terms of the old contract indefinitely while it continues bargaining for a new one with unions representing technicians and customer service workers.   Workers will start to head back to work for late shifts on Monday night and the rest of the striking workers will show up to their jobs on Tuesday, one of the unions said.   Neither side would provide details about how the agreement was reached, but both sides continued to nip at each other.   Tens of thousands of Verizon managers were asked to work 12 hours a day for six days a week and many worked more than that to cover for the strikers, said Verizon spokesman Richard Young. Verizon said its management team’s work helped “convince the unions to begin bargaining with us in good faith.”   “The fortitude and efforts of our managers have proven to be our strongest point of leverage in bargaining,” Marc Reed, Verizon’s executive vice president of human resources, said in a statement.   The Communications Workers of America said it was “outraged” by the company’s comments, and demanded a retraction.   “It is both inaccurate and insulting,” the CWA said in a statement. “We agreed with management not to claim victory in changing the process, reinstituting the contract or shaping our goals. We will be prepared to fight and fight hard whenever necessary if Verizon believes it can resume negotiations on that basis.”   The agreement to continue talks follows an announcement by the company last week that healthcare benefits would expire on Aug. 31 for workers who were still on strike at the time.   This would have affected 35,000 workers represented by the Communications Workers of America, and another 10,000 members of The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in nine states and the District of Columbia.   The decision to end the strike came after the unions and the company were able to agree on a structure and focus for bargaining on key issues such as jobs, employment security and financial issues such as healthcare contributions and pensions, according to CWA President Larry Cohen.   Cohen told Reuters that the issues on the table are complicated and will “take some time” to work out but he said the union was looking forward to the joint process.   “We would both say that this focus is much better than it was two weeks ago,” Cohen said.   The striking workers are in Verizon’s wireline business which provides telephone, Internet and television services.   Verizon is looking to cut costs in this business, which has been declining for years as consumers have been hanging up home phones in favor of cellphones and Internet services.   But the unions had argued that Verizon was looking for too many concessions in areas such as healthcare contributions, pensions and work rules.   Verizon said it had made headway with negotiating a “number of local and regional” issues with the unions.   The dispute quickly turned bitter as Verizon complained of network sabotage on the second day of the strike while the unions said picketers were injured by vehicles driven by Verizon managers covering for the strikers.   Both sides also swapped complaints at the National Labor Relations Board.   Cohen said the problems facing the strikers went beyond Verizon and its workers. He argued that there should be some kind of national framework for workers healthcare and bargaining rights.   “I don’t really blame Verizon leadership for this problem,” he said. “It’s the nation.”  (Additional reporting by Mark Weinraub in Chicago; editing by Vicki Allen and Sandra Maler)  ",8202011,http://www.reuters.com/article/verizon-labor/refile-update-3-verizon-strike-to-end-talks-to-continue-idUSN1E77J05H20110820

130,VZ,Sprint to start selling iPhone 5 mid-Oct: report,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sprint Nextel will start selling the next version of the Apple Inc iPhone in mid-October, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal that cited unnamed sources.  This would make Sprint, the third U.S. operator to become a cellphone distributor for Apple, the only iPhone provider offering unlimited use data services for a flat monthly fee if it sticks with its current wireless data offerings.  Verizon Wireless and AT&T will also start selling the device — dubbed the iPhone 5 — in mid-October, according to the story. Sprint, AT&T and Verizon declined comment and an Apple spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.  A mid October launch for the next iPhone agrees with Verizon’s expectation, announced in July, that it would have a new iPhone in the fall.  AT&T Inc and Verizon Wireless already sell the iPhone 4 but these companies have eliminated flat-fee data plans and instead charge more for customers who use more data services.  Sprint shares closed 10.1 percent higher on Tuesday. An iPhone with unlimited data services is expected to help Sprint, which has been losing subscribers to its rivals, to start reporting net customer additions again, one analyst said.  “Combined with the company’s marketing focus on its unlimited plan, iPhone would drive a rebound in subscriber growth,” said Mizuho analyst Michael Nelson who said it could help Sprint exceed his expectation for fourth-quarter net subscriber additions of about 190,000.  Since Verizon and Sprint use the same network technology, analysts have long speculated that it made sense for Apple to widen its distribution to Sprint. While Sprint executives have previously said they would like to sell the iPhone, they have never confirmed they were in talks with Apple to do so.  If Sprint gets iPhone in October, T-Mobile USA, the no. 4 U.S. service will be the only national U.S. operator without rights to sell the device. But T-Mobile USA, a unit of Deutsche Telekom, is seeking regulatory approval for its plan to be bought by AT&T for $39 billion.  Asked about iPhone a T-Mobile USA spokesman Tom Harlin said that “ultimately that’s Apple’s decision.” Harlin also said: “We’re still focused on Android as our number one priority.”  Smartphones based on Google’s Android operating system outsold the iPhone in the second quarter of this year.  One problem that money-losing Sprint would face when selling the iPhone is the higher costs associated as operators tend to pay Apple higher subsidies for the device than for other phones.  “If they were to receive the iPhone I would expect their handset subsidies would increase and it would have a near term negative impact to margins,” Nelson said.  This could be a tough sell for some investors, especially those who pushed its shares down 20 percent when it reported quarterly results on July 28 as many were skeptical it could meet its profit target for the year.  “Some investors would welcome subscriber growth and others would worry about the increased cost,” said Nelson. “The bulls would argue it’s well worth the cost because it would be accretive to long term margins.”  Verizon Wireless — a venture of Verizon Communications and Vodafone Group Plc — started selling iPhone in February, ending AT&T’s three years of exclusive U.S. rights to the the device.

132,VZ,"TiVo results beat estimates, patents in focus","NEW YORK (Reuters) - TiVo Inc, a maker of digital video recorders, reported second-quarter results on Wednesday that beat expectations and said it is looking at ways to boost the value of its patents.  Shares of the company rose more than 9 percent in after-hours trade.  TiVo (TIVO.O) stands to benefit from the recent surge in interest in tech patents, in light of Google (GOOG.O) buying Motorola Mobility (MMI.N) in August and the Nortel patent auction earlier in the summer.  As companies scramble to secure patents, analysts have been identifying TiVo as a holder of valuable intellectual property related to digital recording.  Chief Executive Tom Rogers said the company is looking at ways to tap the value of its patents, but he declined to provide further details.  “We like the whole environment that is putting focus on patent value and we think that there is certainly going to be a lot of increased attention on advanced television as a sector. We are exploring various ways of looking how to accelerate that value,” he said in an interview.  When an analyst on the conference call asked Rogers if TiVo would license, sell or spin off its patents, he said those options were “worthy of consideration” but did not elaborate.  So far, TiVo’s strategy has been to cash out on its patents in court. In May, it settled a drawn out court case with Dish Network (DISH.O) and won $600 million in licensing fees and damages.  It recorded $11 million in revenue in the second quarter thanks to the Dish settlement.  The company is currently in litigation with Motorola, AT&T (T.N) and Verizon (VZ.N) and said it expects to go to trial in October. TiVo’s patents become more valuable once they have been tested in court, Rogers said.  “You’re seeing a lot of focus on patent value, but the overwhelming number of patents that are changing hands have never been tested. Ours have been battle-tested, and the more battle-tested they are, the more valuable they are,” he said.  For the third quarter, TiVo said it would have net loss of $27 million to $29 million. This is a bigger loss than analysts were expecting.  In the second quarter, TiVo lost $19 million, or 17 cents per share, compared with a loss of $14.3 million, or 13 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. TiVo beat Wall Street estimates by 4 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Revenue rose 19 percent to $61.1 million from $51.5 million a year earlier. This beat analysts’ expectations of $48.31 million.  The company is also gaining traction with its new strategy of licensing its recorder technology to cable operators.

134,VZ,US cable cos challenge plan for broadband subsidies," * Cable industry says phone companies’ plan falls short   * Phone cos hope cable cos won’t slow reform   By Jasmin Melvin   WASHINGTON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - U.S. cable companies are warning regulators about a plan that would give traditional phone companies a first bite at government subsidies to build out broadband in underserved areas.   The Federal Communications Commission is seeking industry input on plans to revamp a government subsidy program that would help deploy high-speed Internet service to millions of Americans living in rural and costly-to-serve areas.   The plans would modernize the “universal service fund” by shifting its focus to broadband service from phone lines.   Phone companies weighed in last month with their blueprint that would start redirecting the fund beginning in 2012.   The National Cable and Telecommunications Association and the American Cable Association said in a letter to the FCC this week that the phone industry’s proposal falls short.   It fails to constrain costs, gives an unfair advantage to incumbent phone companies, and deprives consumers of potentially superior service, the cable groups said in the letter.   NCTA serves as the chief lobbying arm of the cable industry representing networks and operators like Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Time Warner Cable TWC.N, while ACA represents independent companies providing broadband service to 7.6 million subscribers.   Of particular concern to the cable groups was a provision of the plan that gives incumbent carriers first dibs at monies from the fund.   “Support should be awarded to the most efficient provider in a supported area, not simply the one that has been there the longest,” the groups said in the letter.   The cable industry called for “no artificial advantage associated with incumbency and no disadvantage associated with using a particular technology.”   More than 20 million Americans are without access to high-speed Internet.   The phone companies’ plan — backed by Verizon Communications (VZ.N), AT&T Inc (T.N), Frontier Communications Corp FTR.N, CenturyLink Inc (CTL.N), FairPoint Communications Inc FRP.O and Windstream Corp (WIN.O) — would support fixed and mobile broadband, and complete the transition of the universal fund to a broadband focus in 2016.   “The commission should not let its reform efforts once again be stymied by groups that are more dedicated to protecting their individual interests, rather than working constructively toward a realistic solution,” David Fish, spokesman for the six phone companies, said in a statement.   The current patchwork of programs in the FCC’s fund is paid for by fees added to consumers’ telephone bills and annually provides $4.5 billion from the overall $8 billion fund to subsidize telephone service in areas otherwise deemed too costly to serve.   The wasteful spending and inefficiencies present in the program have allowed some telecom providers to receive subsidies in areas where competition exists — at odds with the program’s purpose of helping consumers in areas where it is not economically feasible to offer service.   The cable groups said long overdue reforms of the program should include a cap on the size of the fund and a stringent adherence to this budget.   Any proposal needs to better ensure that funding for the buildout of broadband networks is concentrated in areas where it does not make economic sense for private investment, NCTA said in a filing with the FCC.

136,VZ,Verizon Wireless customers lose in court,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Reversing its view from a year ago, a federal appeals court said Verizon Wireless customers must resolve disputes over alleged fraudulent cellphone charges individually through arbitration rather than as a class.  The ruling by the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia came four months after a divided U.S. Supreme Court, in a case involving AT&T Inc (T.N), gave businesses a big victory in upholding individual arbitrations to resolve customer disputes.  Some consumer advocates say arbitration favors companies by making it too costly for consumers to bring small claims.  Verizon Wireless customers had claimed that a 2006 New Jersey Supreme Court decision made it “unconscionable” to enforce a clause in their service contracts requiring them to arbitrate small administrative charges they deemed unfair.  A three-judge panel of the 3rd Circuit, which includes New Jersey, had ruled in their favor in May 2010.  But on Wednesday, the same panel said the U.S. Supreme Court’s April 27 decision in AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion, by a 5-4 vote, now requires it to rule the other way.  As a result, the panel reinstated a 2008 decision by U.S. District Judge Freda Wolfson in Trenton. She said the Federal Arbitration Act “establishes a strong federal policy” favoring arbitration, and takes precedence over the New Jersey case.  The Concepcion holding is “broad and clear: a state law that seeks to impose class arbitration despite a contractual agreement for individualized arbitration is inconsistent with, and therefore preempted by, the FAA, irrespective of whether class arbitration is desirable for unrelated reasons,” Judge Kent Jordan wrote for the 3rd Circuit panel.

138,VZ,RPT-US quake bolsters calls for public safety wireless network," (Repeats to widen distribution)   * Quake rattles East Coast, disrupts cell phone service   * Puts spotlight back on need for a public safety network   * Tug-of-war over D Block could be solved in debt talks   By Jasmin Melvin   WASHINGTON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Disruption of cell phone service by a rare U.S. East Coast earthquake on Tuesday prompted renewed calls for Congress and regulators to provide a dedicated wireless network for emergency workers.   The 5.8 magnitude earthquake centered in Virginia shut federal government agencies some 90 miles away and sent office workers into the streets as tremors were felt as far as Canada.   The Federal Communications Commission said it is assessing a significant disruption to cell service due to the quake and will be looking at ways to improve communications during emergencies.   Verizon Wireless, AT&T Inc (T.N), Sprint Nextel (S.N), T-Mobile USA and Frontier Communications Corp FTR.N all reported higher call volumes and network congestion in affected areas, making it difficult to reach out to family and friends after the quake over cell phones.   “We were unable to get cell phone access for a period of about an hour immediately after the quake,” said Dennis Martinez, chief technology officer for the RF Communications Division of Harris Corp (HRS.N).   The large percentage of first responders who rely on cellular data networks for some of their services would have experienced the same outage, Martinez said.   Creating a nationwide mobile broadband network for emergency services is a key 9/11 Commission recommendation that has yet to be put into action as the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks by hijacked airliners approaches.   The wireless network would allow firemen, police and other first responders to easily communicate, but lawmakers and regulators have yet to reach a consensus on how to build, maintain and fund the network.   Of particular contention is whether to allocate a highly sought after segment of the 700 megahertz band of airwaves called the D Block directly to public safety groups, or to auction it to commercial carriers who will be mandated to share it with first responders.   Public safety groups have pushed for control of the D Block, which the FCC is currently under instruction from Congress to auction off, and used the earthquake to strengthen their case.   “In the wake of the earthquake, cell service went dark,” said Public Safety Alliance spokesman Sean Kirkendall. “It’s a perfect illustration why public safety needs nationwide, mission critical broadband capability of its own.”   Ongoing discussions among lawmakers on debt reduction could help sway the fight for the D Block in public safety’s favor.   Harris’ Martinez said auctioning spectrum to generate revenue has caught the eye of lawmakers, and there is broad support to use a portion of the auction proceeds to fund the public safety network.   AT&T and Verizon Wireless also have supported giving the D Block to public safety. Verizon Wireless is a joint venture of Verizon Communications (VZ.N) and Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L), while AT&T is awaiting regulatory approval for a $39 billion bid to buy T-Mobile from Deutsche Telekom AG (DTEGn.DE).   But smaller carriers hoping to acquire more spectrum to better compete with industry powerhouses have favored a shared commercial and public safety network.   A study commissioned by Sprint and T-Mobile said there were no technical barriers standing in the way of first responders having priority access on a network shared with commercial carriers.   Still, a previous effort to auction the D block for shared commercial use with public safety groups failed.   “There’s no reason to believe it would succeed on a second go-around,” Martinez said.

The large percentage of first responders who rely on cellular data networks for some of their services would have experienced the same outage, Martinez said.  Creating a nationwide mobile broadband network for emergency services is a key 9/11 Commission recommendation that has yet to be put into action as the 10th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks by hijacked airliners approaches.  The wireless network would allow firemen, police and other first responders to easily communicate, but lawmakers and regulators have yet to reach a consensus on how to build, maintain and fund the network.  Of particular contention is whether to allocate a highly sought after segment of the 700 megahertz band of airwaves called the D Block directly to public safety groups, or to auction it to commercial carriers who will be mandated to share it with first responders.  Public safety groups have pushed for control of the D Block, which the FCC is currently under instruction from Congress to auction off, and used the earthquake to strengthen their case.  “In the wake of the earthquake, cell service went dark,” said Public Safety Alliance spokesman Sean Kirkendall. “It’s a perfect illustration why public safety needs nationwide, mission critical broadband capability of its own.”  Ongoing discussions among lawmakers on debt reduction could help sway the fight for the D Block in public safety’s favor.  Harris’ Martinez said auctioning spectrum to generate revenue has caught the eye of lawmakers, and there is broad support to use a portion of the auction proceeds to fund the public safety network.  AT&T and Verizon Wireless also have supported giving the D Block to public safety. Verizon Wireless is a joint venture of Verizon Communications and Vodafone Group Plc, while AT&T is awaiting regulatory approval for a $39 billion bid to buy T-Mobile from Deutsche Telekom AG.  But smaller carriers hoping to acquire more spectrum to better compete with industry powerhouses have favored a shared commercial and public safety network.  A study commissioned by Sprint and T-Mobile said there were no technical barriers standing in the way of first responders having priority access on a network shared with commercial carriers.  Still, a previous effort to auction the D block for shared commercial use with public safety groups failed.  “There’s no reason to believe it would succeed on a second go-around,” Martinez said.

143,VZ,"Analysis: Network gear makers stumble, but growth still there","(Reuters) - As sales of smartphones soar and companies shift data to cloud computing, the outlook for the makers of the switches, routers and other gear to manage networks may not be as gloomy as recent share market performance suggests.  Pent-up demand from the recession years drove up industry sales by around 30 percent last year, but recent warnings from network gear makers that they face weaker business and government spending have battered their stock prices.  Juniper Networks (JNPR.N) — which, like market leader Cisco Systems (CSCO.O), makes equipment for wireless carriers to smooth the flow of data by spreading it across a network — has seen $3 billion wiped off its market value in one day. Shares of Brocade Communications Systems Inc BRCD.O, a maker of switches for data centers, have more than halved since early June.  The broader S&P Communications Equipment Index .GSPCOMM has lost 10 percent in the same period.  Yes, analysts say, the heady growth may be over but the industry will keep growing — driven by the increasing popularity of both smartphones and cloud computing.  Rather than trimming budgets, some telecoms carriers are actually spending more to upgrade their networks to 4G LTE technology and meet the insatiable thirst for data from smartphones and tablets such as Apple Inc’s APPL.O iPad.  Smartphone penetration in the United States is expected to triple in 5 years from around 20 percent currently, according to a report from brokerage Oppenheimer and Co.  “We don’t believe the market will decline and, in spite of the fears of a slowdown, the market will grow, albeit slowly,” said Rohit Mehra, an analyst at IT research firm IDC.  He predicts growth will be in the mid-single digits, while Morningstar analyst Grady Burkett expects the overall market to grow at 7-8 percent in the next 2-3 years.  Burkett said the current second half would be weak, but “then we’ll probably see a decent snap back in the second-half of 2012 based on easier comps and replacement cycles.”  AT&T (T.N) has said it will raise its 2011 capital spending to $20 billion from $19 billion, mainly to support increasing demand for its wireless services.Verizon, which accelerated domestic wireless spending in the first half year, is maintaining its $16.5 billion capex budget for the year.  “We expect the LTE revenue flow to vendors will accelerate significantly in 2012. But it won’t be a flood,” said Matt Walker, principal telecom analyst at Ovum Research. “With the more incremental LTE upgrades, vendors should see a larger share of capex hit their books.”  Ovum expects carrier-service related sales to grow at 11.5 percent, while Morningstar’s Burkett predicts routers and switches will grow at 5-6 percent.  “Cisco is still our best idea, and Juniper looks attractively valued ... if you’re patient, Juniper is the place to be,” Burkett added.  Cisco recently forecast its revenue would rise 1-4 percent this quarter, indicating government and business demand for networking may not be as bad as forecast.  Data centers, the other big customers for gear makers, are also set to boom as companies shift to cloud computing to save on IT infrastructure costs.  Networking gear for data centers — the giant warehouses lined wall-to-wall with powerful storage servers — had global sales of about $37 billion last year. Those are forecast to grow to $41 billion in 2012, says industry research firm Gartner.  More companies are putting their servers and data storage together, and this will create more opportunities for gear makers in the next 3-5 years, IDC’s Mehra said.  He expects WAN optimizers, which are needed for speeding up traffic over networks, and application delivery controllers (ADCs), which filter data streams, to see double-digit sales growth.  “In ADC, the leader is F5 Networks (FFIV.O). They will benefit. In WAN optimization, it’s Riverbed and they’ll continue to benefit,” said Mehra.  Aruba Networks ARUN.O is another company making WAN accelerators and optimizers that speed up the flow of data and help filter those data streams in data centers.  Morningstar’s Burkett expects WAN optimizers and ADCs to grow in the upper mid-teens.  Analysts also expect Brocade, which accounts for about 70 percent of storage equipment sales, to see revenue growth in the mid-single digit range starting in 2012.  “The fundamentals of networking and the huge need for data management are still very much in place,” said Petr Jirovsky, another IDC analyst.

144,VZ,TREASURIES-Prices gain on U.S. unemployment worries," * Weekly jobless claims rise by more than expected   * Stocks gain on Berkshire investment in B of A   * Price gains limited ahead of 7-year note auction   * Investors look ahead to Bernanke speech on Friday  (Adds analysts’ comments, updates prices)   By Chris Reese   NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury debt prices rose on Thursday as higher-than-expected new claims for U.S. jobless benefits stirred nagging worries about high U.S. unemployment.   Price gains were limited however, as the government said the level of jobless claims was lifted by striking Verizon Communications workers, an impact which should be temporary.   Strength in U.S. stocks also reined in Treasuries gains — equities were bolstered by news Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) agreed to invest $5 billion in Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) For details see [ID:nN1E77O0HA].   Investors were also reluctant to push debt prices significantly higher heading into an auction of seven-year Treasury notes on Thursday afternoon.   Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 417,000, the Labor Department said, adding that striking Verizon (VZ.N) workers filed 8,500 claims for jobless benefits last week, after submitting 12,500 applications the previous week. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 405,000 last week. [ID:nN1E77O0C9].   The worries over the state of the labor market bolstered the safe-haven appeal of U.S. government debt.   “Those strikers report themselves as unemployed. It’s a temporary effect, but still this doesn’t look good for the jobs market,” said Robbert Van Batenburg, head of global research at Louis Capital Markets in New York.   Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR were trading 8/32 higher in price to yield 2.27 percent, down from 2.30 percent late on Wednesday, while the 30-year bond US30YT=RR was 7/32 higher to yield 3.64 percent from 3.65 percent.   “Overall, a soft report on the labor front,” said Ian Lyngen, senior government bond strategist at CRT Capital Group in Stamford, Connecticut. “The Treasury market was trading better ahead of the release and since the data the market has climbed further.”   Still, investors were reluctant to allow Treasuries to trade too much higher in price ahead of the Treasury’s auction of $29 billion of seven-year notes US7YT=RR on Thursday afternoon.   The notes were trading on the open market with a yield of 1.57 percent. In the when-issued market, considered a proxy for where traders expect the high yield to come in at auction, seven-year notes US7YTWI=TWEB were trading with a yield just above 1.60 percent.   Investors are also anxiously waiting to hear from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Friday, when he speaks on near and long-term prospects for the U.S. economy at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The speech will be closely watched for any hints U.S. central bank officials may be contemplating further stimulus to roust the economy from the current economic malaise.   While the focus is on Bernanke’s speech, few expect him to announce any significant new programs similar to the latest $600 billion round of Treasuries buying, known as QE2, which ended in June.   “Our expectations remain limited for the chairman to deliver any policy changes and we look for a downbeat assessment of the economic outlook and an outlining of the Fed’s options,” Lyngen said.

145,VZ,FCC clock resumes on AT&T;/T-Mobile deal review,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Communications Commission said it has restarted the clock on its review of AT&T Inc’s (T.N) proposed $39 billion purchase of smaller rival T-Mobile USA.  The FCC, which had started examining the deal in late April, had paused what is typically a 180-day review on July 20 after AT&T said it would submit new arguments to support its application.  The regulator said it restarted the process on Friday, day 83 of the review, after it received answers to questions it had asked AT&T, the No. 2 U.S. mobile service.  AT&T has said buying the unit of Deutsche Telekom AG (DTEGn.DE) would allow it to quickly add capacity to meet growing demand for high-speed wireless service.  T-Mobile has said it would not be able to remain competitive in the U.S. wireless market as Deutsche Telekom is unable to finance the investments required to handle the explosion in data usage.  “There is now an even stronger record before the Commission that supports prompt approval of our transaction and we would urge the FCC to act quickly to approve it,” Tom Sugrue, T-Mobile senior vice president for government affairs, said in a statement.  But rivals such as Sprint Nextel Corp (S.N) have said the deal, which would vault AT&T to the top of  the U.S. market, ahead of Verizon Wireless, will hurt competition.  If approved as proposed, the merger would concentrate 80 percent of the U.S. wireless market in AT&T/T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless, a venture of Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L).  Public interest groups like Free Press and Public Knowledge have argued the merger would lead to higher prices and limit consumer choice.  “We are glad the Commission has decided that AT&T has had more than enough chances to make its case, and is restarting the clock on its merits,” said Gigi Sohn, president of Public Knowledge.  Free Press earlier this month highlighted unintentionally posted AT&T filings with the FCC that suggested the company could deploy high-speed Internet services to rural areas for $3.8 billion, without acquiring T-Mobile and at a tenth of the cost.  “We fully expect this disastrous anti-competitive and job-killing proposal will be swiftly rejected,” said Free Press Research Director S. Derek Turner in a statement on Friday.  In addition to the FCC’s public interest review, the Justice Department is weighing the antitrust implications of the deal.  AT&T has said it expects the deal, announced in late March, to be completed in roughly a year.  Shares of AT&T were up three cents to $29.09 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

147,VZ,Verizon strike to weigh on August jobs report,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Labor strikes in the United States left 46,300 workers idle during the reference period for the government’s August employment survey, the Labor Department said on Friday.

The big question is whether Apple can continue to transform the landscape while making an impact on pop culture in the way that Mr. Jobs has for the past two decades. 	   * Steve Jobs has stepped down from his pulpit. Now, followers of the “Cult of Mac” are contemplating a world without their charismatic leader.	   * Steve Jobs has his name on more than 300 patents, a sign that he did more to create Apple Inc.’s landmark products than simply supervise engineers. But the company’s originality, and handling of intellectual property, have frequently been controversial topics.	   * Switch off a car’s engine on a slope and it will accelerate down the hill for a good long while. The same kind of momentum can carry a company quite a long way, unless it hits a wall. That’s what Apple bulls need to remember as they contemplate the tech giant without Steve Jobs as chief executive.	   * AIG chief Benmosche has complained to senior bank executives about unfavorable stock research, suggesting some analysts don’t fully understand AIG’s value.	   * Goldman Sachs officials have been reminding some of its U.K. workers that higher salaries granted in 2010 would revert back after two years, and that time is coming. 	   * Former Lehman Brothers Chief Executive Dick Fuld and other directors and officers are seeking the release of $90 million in insurance funds to settle a potential multibillion-dollar lawsuit brought by shareholders of the failed investment bank.	   * Euro-zone policy makers appeared no nearer to settling a dispute over Finland’s collateral demands in exchange for participating in a bailout for Greece.	   * Asian shares and currencies stuck to tight ranges, amid choppy trade and after Wall Street’s decline provided little incentive to buy stocks.

150,VZ,Analysis: Verizon seen winning healthcare union fight,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications is expected to prevail on key issues such as healthcare costs in its negotiations with unions but may end up postponing its plan to freeze pensions, according to experts who have been following the telephone company’s labor dispute.  Negotiations between Verizon and the unions representing its wireline workers are expected to resume on Wednesday after both sides last week agreed on a new framework for bargaining. About 45,000 technical and customer service workers — roughly half of Verizon’s wireline workforce — returned to work last week after a two-week work stoppage.  “With the workforce returning to work, both sides realize that an extended strike would be very costly and they’re both backing down,” said Professor Harry Katz, a labor specialist at Cornell University. Katz added, however, “Verizon is going to get meaningful concessions in the negotiations. They’re just not going to get the extreme draconian concessions they were after.”  Verizon workers had walked off the job August 7 after talks on a new contract broke down. The unions claimed that Verizon was looking for too many concessions in areas such as healthcare, pensions, work rules and job security.  In returning to work last week, the labor groups said Verizon had changed its tone and was now ready to at least talk about giving up on some of its demands. As a good faith measure, the unions said they would not walk out for 30 days and promised a week’s notice for any strikes after that.  For its part, Verizon reinstated the terms of the old contract indefinitely, giving workers breathing room while negotiations continue. Despite this gesture, the unions still expect very difficult negotiations.  Neither Verizon nor the two unions representing the workers — the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers — would provide specifics on which concessions might be made by either side.  One area where workers are widely expected to concede is in healthcare contributions, according to several experts. Verizon wants workers to contribute to healthcare insurance premiums, something they don’t do today.  “The notion that workers won’t pay more for healthcare is almost certainly lost,” said Professor Joseph Foudy of New York University’s Stern School of Business.  But, Verizon may have to be more flexible in areas such as pensions, according to Foudy and two other academics. Verizon has said it wants to freeze pensions for union workers and instead revamp its 401(k) plans for those employees.  The company already made this change for its nonunion workers. However, it may end up conceding on this by keeping  pension contributions intact for existing employees.  Verizon, which wants to phase out pensions, likely will not offer that benefit to new workers, said Rutgers School of Management Professor Jeffrey Keefe, who has studied telecommunications industry labor trends.  Foudy also said Verizon could end up with a “staggered move for change in the pension.” He said that the company could also keep job security assurances for workers, at least in the short term, in order to get the contract approved.  Last week’s events show that the strike hurt both sides, according to industrial relations experts, pointing to customer frustration with Verizon and the potential loss of healthcare benefits on August 31 for workers if they kept striking.  While labor watchers described Verizon’s initial demands as “extremely aggressive,” the fact that it has agreed to negotiate under a framework that the unions deem acceptable indicated that its final demands are likely to be softer.  “If all you’re demanding is cuts across the board, why agree to anything,” said Rutgers’ Keefe, who added that the move to bargain was “the first sign from the company that they want to settle the contract.”  Verizon recruited tens of thousands of managers to cover for the workers during the two weeks they were on strike. But these managers aren’t skilled enough to handle jobs such as repairs and installations that are routine tasks for the trained union workers, Keefe said.  “It’s not easy to replace this workforce,” he said.  And since the unions agreed to go back to work, it must mean that they have received something from the company such as assurances of compromise on some specific issues, said Wharton School of Business Professor Peter Cappelli.  “The union loses a lot of its bargaining power once its off the picket line. If they’re going back it means that they feel its not going to help them to stay out,” said Cappelli, adding. “That’s because the big issues have been settled.”  Meanwhile, investors have basically shrugged off the labor dispute, with Verizon shares up almost 3 percent since the company’s pre-strike close on the New York Stock Exchange while shares of rival AT&T Inc have risen 1.2 percent.  “I think the company has the upper hand as shown by the union going back to work without a contract,” said D.A. Davidson analyst Donna Jaegers, who noted that the dispute might even help Verizon’s financials.  “If the strike is less than a month long its usually a net positive for the company in terms of profitability,” she said.

151,VZ,Eyes on jobs as Bernanke mulls action,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Central bank chief Ben Bernanke once criticized Japan for dithering with its economic crisis. Now he tells the world he needs time to think.  U.S. employment data due on Friday could make the clock tick very loudly for the Federal Reserve chairman.  Bernanke disappointed some financial market participants last week when he declined to give details on how the Fed could lift a U.S. economy moving ahead at stall speed.  Most economists expected his widely anticipated speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, would at least give a tour of his monetary toolkit.  Instead, he only offered a promise that policymakers will take an extra day to think things over at the Fed’s September policy meeting.  Meanwhile, Friday’s data is expected to show U.S. job growth was so weak during August that a higher unemployment rate could be around the corner.  “That number, if it does come in weak, will make the September meeting very interesting,” said Jeff Greenberg, an economist at Nomura Securities in New York.  U.S. job growth in August is expected to have risen a tepid 80,000 in August, with the unemployment rate clinging to 9.1 percent, according to a median of economists’ forecasts captured in a Reuters poll.  Projections ranged from a drop of 25,000 to a gain of 160,000.  While the payroll figure will be depressed by 46,300 workers who were idled by strikes during the government’s payroll survey period — including some 45,000 at Verizon Communications, it’s unlikely to lift the gloom over the outlook.  In Bernanke’s defense, while he faces giant expectations to steer the developed world away from another recession, he is very alone right now.  The U.S. Congress appears in little mood to help the economy by boosting spending. European leaders are squabbling over who pays the bills for their debt crisis. Japan is locked in political paralysis.  Yet it’s not totally clear what Bernanke is waiting for.  The economic outlook is blurry. While U.S. consumers and factory managers have a very dismal outlook, measures of actual production look more sound if not particularly heart-warming.  So, he could be waiting for unequivocal signs a recession is coming before acting.  Or he might be biding time to build a case within the central bank for bolder action. Earlier this month, three Fed policymakers dissented on the central bank’s promise to keep interest rates near zero for the next two years.  Dissent like that is very rare for the American central bank, which usually operates by consensus. (In a sign of the uncharted territory the Fed now sails, making a such a pledge on rates is even more rare).  Seeking details on what Bernanke and his colleagues at the Fed are thinking, economists will scrutinize the minutes of the central bank’s August meeting, which will be published on Tuesday.  The minutes could give clues on whether growing dissent will delay or mute future action. They might also fill some of the gaps in Bernanke’s speech, such as which policy tools officials might be leaning toward using.  Some economists worry U.S. policymakers are not taking seriously enough the gravity of their situation.  The Fed appears wary to wheel out the big guns of its policy arsenal — further bond purchases — in part because deflation does not seem an imminent risk.  But a failure to head off any building weakness could put the risk of a spiral of falling prices back on the radar. Deflation can cripple economy by leading consumers to pull back on spending and businesses to cut new investments.  Capital Economics, an economic consultancy, sees a lot of parallels between America now and deflation-striken Japan in the 1990s, which Bernanke once criticized for a half-hearted policy response.  “There is a much bigger risk than most realize that the U.S. will endure a lost decade and, eventually, deflation,” Capital Economics economist Paul Dales wrote in a research report.  Dales points out that Japan didn’t firmly slip into deflation until nearly a decade after its own property bubble popped. Japan never really recovered.  In a 1999 academic paper, Bernanke said Japan’s problems were due to policymakers’ self-induced paralysis.  He made clear in his Jackson Hole speech on Friday that he was concerned about the weak economy, particularly about the plight of the long-term jobless because their atrophying skills could deal lasting damage to the economy.  He said it was important to boost employment before that damage takes hold.  The jobs report on Friday might inject a new sense of urgency to that task.

152,VZ,"U.S. moves to block AT&T;, T-Mobile deal","WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Obama administration sued to block AT&T Inc’s $39 billion acquisition of wireless rival T-Mobile on concerns it would harm competition, launching its biggest challenge yet to a takeover and dealing the carrier a potentially costly blow.  AT&T, led by Chief Executive Randall Stephenson, plans to fight the government’s decision in court, and analysts say it might have to make big concessions — including selling major assets — to mollify regulators.  Shares of AT&T, the No. 2 U.S. carrier behind Verizon Wireless, fell as much as 5.4 percent. If AT&T’s purchase of the No. 4 carrier T-Mobile USA falls through, it may have to pay a huge break-up fee and benefits, such as spectrum grants, worth an estimated $6 billion to Deutsche Telekom.  The Justice Department in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday said eliminating T-Mobile as a competitor would be disastrous for consumers and raise prices, particularly because the smaller provider is considered a pioneer in low-cost service plans.  “The biggest surprise is the timing. Many expected, because of how big the merger (is), the complexities, how big the stakes were, that it would take longer,” said Medley Global Advisors analyst Jeffrey Silva.  The lawsuit is a serious attempt to halt a “fundamentally flawed” deal, not a tactic to wring outsized concessions from AT&T, a source familiar with the lawsuit said, adding that the companies would have to give up “so much” to win approval.  “Were the merger to proceed, there would only be three providers with 90 percent of the market, and competition among the remaining competitors on all dimensions, including price, quality and innovation, would be diminished,” said Deputy Attorney General James Cole.  The department said it remains open to negotiations with the company, but most likely it will be up to the courts.  AT&T’s Stephenson has argued that his company needs T-Mobile to get more wireless airwaves to meet growing demand for high-speed services.  The planned acquisition is a career-defining move for Stephenson, who has lived under the shadow of predecessor Ed Whitacre, said a source close to AT&T. Stephenson put himself on the line with this deal so he has no choice but to double down, the source said.  The government’s lawsuit caught AT&T and Wall Street by surprise, coming hours after the telecoms carrier said it would bring back 5,000 call center jobs to the United States if the deal closed.  If the Justice Department succeeds, it would be a black eye for not just Stephenson, but also T-Mobile USA CEO Philipp Humm. Shares of Deutsche Telekom fell 7.6 percent.  AT&T representatives met with Justice Department officials as recently as Tuesday, and received no indication that the lawsuit was coming, a second source with knowledge of the meetings told Reuters.  Another source close to the deal said the two sides were just beginning the back and forth in the review and no detailed discussions about remedies occurred, nor were specific concessions on the table.  “Clearly AT&T didn’t expect this,” said Pacific Crest Securities analyst Steve Clement. “It changes things for them with respect to the spectrum flexibility they’d have.”  The lawsuit is the biggest challenge to a takeover by the Obama administration, which includes former AT&T executive William Daley, who serves as White House chief of staff.  The agency has been working for months on the deal, despite the departure of the antitrust division’s chief, Christine Varney. She left for private practice and was replaced by her chief of staff Sharis Pozen on an acting basis.  The federal government has challenged past deals, some of which were abandoned, but on other occasions the companies have fought and been able to close the transactions. The Obama administration has cleared other big deals like Comcast Corp’s purchase of NBC Universal.  It remains unclear how the federal courts would treat the case, but one thing most experts agree on is that it would take a long time to wind its way through the system.  The question is whether the companies are willing to pursue that route and for how long, or go their separate ways.  “We plan to ask for an expedited hearing so the enormous benefits of this merger can be fully reviewed,” said AT&T General Counsel Wayne Watts.  The $3 billion break-up fee would be the largest-ever triggered, according to Thomson Reuters data. Seven investment banks could also face forfeiting almost $150 million in fees.  “This is an administration that came in saying it was going to have a more aggressive approach,” said Michael Sohn, an antitrust attorney with Davis Polk Wardwell LLP.  Another complicating factor is the deal also needs approve by the Federal Communications Commission, which regulates wireless communications. FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski said he is concerned about the deal’s impact on competition.  “Ultimately, post concessions, we still expect the deal to be cleared — eventually,” said Liberium Capital analyst Mark James.  A scuppered acquisition could prompt Sprint Nextel Corp, the smallest of the top three U.S. carriers, to consider buying T-Mobile USA, a unit of Deutsche Telekom AG, analysts said.  More immediately, the decision is a letdown for the German carrier and puts a cloud over the senior executives there and at AT&T who exuded confidence about the deal and touted plans to reach underserved areas.  “(Deutsche Telekom) will gain some short-term consolation from the penalties it can exact from AT&T,” said John Delaney, an analyst at technology research firm IDC. “But in the end, DT would still be stuck with the problem of how to turn around a sub-scale national operator with a declining subscriber base.”  AT&T shares fell $1.36, or more than 4.6 percent, to $28.26. Stock in rival Sprint, which called the lawsuit a “victory for consumers,” rose 6 percent to $3.76.  Despite a spike in its shares, some analysts say the picture is not all good because the removal of T-Mobile — which has a reputation for aggressively under-cutting rivals on price — could have helped Sprint in certain market segments.  “It’s mixed for Sprint. On the one hand, they were potentially going to lose T-Mobile USA as a competitor at the low end of the market,” Clement said. “Now it’s going to face a T-Mobile that’s in a better position prior to the merger proposal, with extra cash and spectrum and a new roaming agreement with AT&T.”  The case is USA v. AT&T Inc et al, No. 11-cv-1560 in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.  ",8312011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-att-tmobile/u-s-moves-to-block-att-t-mobile-deal-idUSTRE77U39220110831

Now comes the hard part: going to court.  The government is asking a federal judge in Washington, D.C., to stop the deal, and will have to prove that it would mean higher prices and less competition.  “This will be the Obama administration’s line in the sand. This will be their signature antitrust event,” said University of Baltimore law school professor Robert Lande.  AT&T has said it will fight the case, and its general counsel said it plans to seek an expedited hearing from the judge. Even so, experts say, the company could decide that it is not worth the expense and uncertainty to go to trial.  An AT&T spokeswoman declined to comment.  Two big communications deals, MCI’s proposed takeover of Sprint in 1999 and EchoStar Communications Corp’s deal to buy Hughes Electronic Corp’s DirecTV in 2001 fell apart after the Justice Department challenged the deals.  “A preliminary question is whether AT&T will go to court. It’s certainly not uncommon for companies to look at this and decide that the game isn’t worth the gamble,” said David Smutny, an antitrust lawyer with Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe.  The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle, who also oversaw the EchoStar-Hughes antitrust court challenge. Huvelle was appointed to the bench in 1999 by then President Bill Clinton.  In pre-trial proceedings in that case, Huvelle had harsh words for the way both companies responded to regulators’ information requests, calling them “sluggish.”  Any trial in the AT&T case would be lengthy and complicated, with experts predicting that both sides would put on a parade of witnesses including consumers, economists, and possibly competitors or state regulators.  In its complaint, the Justice Department argued that AT&T has overwhelming power in the national market — it is one of four major carriers — and that the market for mobile telecommunications would be highly concentrated in 96 of 100 U.S. cell phone market areas.  AT&T is likely to argue that the deal would create efficiencies in terms of price, quality and innovation — and maybe even jobs, said Lande, the Baltimore professor.  “Very few efficiency defenses work,” said Lande, who praised the Justice Department for bringing the action. “They make promises that these efficiencies could happen, but showing that in court is very difficult.”  While most antitrust attorneys declined to say how they thought the case would be decided, Howard University law professor Andy Gavil said he thought the judge would block the deal. “Having read the complaint, I don’t see a basis for a negotiated settlement,” said Gavil, who testified to Congress on the deal.  Two other veteran Washington antitrust attorneys, who declined to be identified because of potential conflicts involving their law firms and companies in the case, told Reuters they think the deal will be stopped, either because the court blocks it or because AT&T drops its bid.  If the case goes to trial, there may be no quick end. The losing side is likely to appeal.  “You could have a situation here where the combined litigation and regulatory process could extend for several months or years,” said Maury Mechanick, a telecommunications attorney at law firm White & Case.  “From a business practicality perspective, is that a delay that AT&T and T-Mobile can tolerate?” said Mechanick. “That’s ultimately a judgment that they will have to make.”  The case is USA v.

Now it’s going to face a T-Mobile that’s in a better position prior to the merger proposal, with extra cash and spectrum and a new roaming agreement with AT&T.”  “It also puts T-Mobile USA back in play as a potential merger candidate for Sprint.”  “The momentum had been building on the positive case. A lot of state governors, attorneys-general had been coming out in support of the case. AT&T had been lobbying on creating 5,000 more U.S. jobs, guaranteeing no more call center redundancies.  “We thought the weight of AT&T’s lobbying was having some success; this very much undermines that. It’s very uncertain where this leaves us at the moment. The stock price reaction is probably a little bit overdone today but it’s still clearly a negative development, given the commentary we’d seen so far.”  TIM DANIELS, TELECOMS ANALYST AT LONDON-BASED STOCKBROKER OLIVETREE SECURITIES  “I don’t think you can call the deal 100 percent dead yet but it is almost certain not to progress in its original form. If the FCC rules against it as well, I don’t see how AT&T can maintain any argument that the deal is in the public interest.”  “The news clearly throws the deal into considerable doubt. The DOJ has said the door remains open for remedies, but if you’re talking about market concentration as the point of contention there’s only so much in terms of subscriber divestments you can achieve without undoing the economies of scale you were seeking in the first place.  “AT&T is going to be on the hook for break-up fee of $3 billion plus spectrum and a roaming deal, but AT&T will still be a formidable player with huge scale. It makes a big difference to Sprint, since the competitive efforts of the big guys would be diluted.  “It would also be a big deal for T-Mobile’s owner, Deutsche Telekom, which now has the problem it had before, with a subscale operation in the U.S. All those problems now come back.  The DOJ’s concerns imply that they don’t want less than four big national players. There had been speculation that Sprint and T-Mobile may get together, but it looks on this basis that even that would be objectionable.”  “The Department filed its lawsuit because we believe the combination of AT&T and T-Mobile would result in tens of millions of consumers all across the United States facing higher prices, fewer choices and lower quality products for their mobile wireless services.  “AT&T and T-Mobile currently compete head-to-head in 97 of the nation’s largest 100 cellular marketing areas. They also compete nationwide to attract business and government customers.  “Were the merger to proceed, there would only be three providers with 90 percent of the market, and competition among the remaining competitors on all dimensions-including price, quality, and innovation-would be diminished.”  WAYNE WATTS, AT&T GENERAL COUNSEL  “We are surprised and disappointed by today’s action, particularly since we have met repeatedly with the Department of Justice and there was no indication from the DOJ that this action was being contemplated.  “We plan to ask for an expedited hearing so the enormous benefits of this merger can be fully reviewed. The DOJ has the burden of proving alleged anti-competitive affects and we intend to vigorously contest this matter in court.”  JULIUS GENACHOWSKI, FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION CHAIRMAN  “Competition is an essential component of the FCC’s statutory public interest analysis, and although our process is not complete, the record before this agency also raises serious concerns about the impact of the proposed transaction on competition.  “Fighting this job-killing merger is the best Labor Day present anyone can give the American people. AT&T’s effort to recreate ‘Ma Cell’ by holding rural broadband hostage and threatening American jobs deserves nothing but scorn.  “The FCC should move as quickly as possible to follow the lead of the Department of Justice and reject the merger.”  ANDREW SCHWARTZMAN, MEDIA ACCESS PROJECT SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND POLICY DIRECTOR  “This is arguably the most anti-competitive move in recent American economic history. It is heartening that the Department of Justice has withstood withering political pressure from AT&T to do the right thing for the American public.”  “AT&T swallowing T-Mobile will essentially result in the U.S. becoming a duopoly with AT&T and Verizon Wireless controlling the vast majority of the market. It will hurt Sprint, and certainly many of the smaller players.  “And since it’s astronomically expensive to start a mobile carrier these days, it’s unlikely that any new competitors will arise unless a big international funding group steps in — perhaps from China — which is unlikely to win approval politically.”  “So the bottom line for me is that even though AT&T certainly would benefit from the increased spectrum available from the T-Mobile acquisition, it may not be in the best interest of the consumer ultimately.”  “On the flip side of course, it may be impossible for T-Mobile to remain an independent player longer term, so an acquisition by AT&T might be in its best business interest. But if T-Mobile goes, it will put incredible pressure on Sprint to find a big brother as well.”  “Understandably this is being taken negatively, but can it really come as a surprise? We retain the view...that regulatory approval will be a long, drawn out process given market shares of the combo will reach 41 percent. Ultimately, post concessions, we still expect the deal to be cleared — eventually.  “Those more bullish than us on DT can draw SOME comfort from the deal break clause. AT&T is on the hook for US$3 billion should the deal falter.  “We remain Sellers of Deutsche Telekom where domestic operations are firmly in reverse. Post deal announcement our concerns were that all the good news was arguably in the price, leaving investors to fret over deal risk and contend with the poor domestic trends.”  REBECCA ARBOGAST, STIFEL NICOLAUS ANALYST IN RESEARCH NOTE  “Based on our quick review of the complaint, we believe the filing is serious and not meant as merely a negotiating strategy to bring AT&T to the table to negotiate conditions and concessions.”  “We expect that AT&T will fight, rather than merely step down as is more common when DOJ moves to block mergers.”  “We would be astonished if the FCC were to approve the deal while litigation is pending before the District Court.”  ",8312011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-att-tmobile-iv/instant-view-u-s-government-to-block-att-bid-for-t-mobile-idUSTRE77U3JZ20110831

A failed deal would be expensive for AT&T, which plans to fight the government’s decision in court. It promised to pay a breakup fee worth an estimated $6 billion, including $3 billion in cash, spectrum and a roaming agreement for T-Mobile USA.   The Justice Department, in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday, said eliminating T-Mobile as a competitor would be disastrous for consumers and would raise prices, particularly because the smaller provider offers low prices.   “Unless this merger is blocked, competition and innovation will be reduced, and consumers will suffer,” said Sharis Pozen, acting head of the Justice Department’s antitrust division.   AT&T will fight the decision in court, said company lawyer Wayne Watts, who added that the Justice Department had given the company no indication that it was contemplating such a move.   The company has argued the deal would let it add capacity and meet demand for high-speed wireless service.   “Clearly AT&T didn’t expect this,” said Pacific Crest Securities analyst Steve Clement. “It changes things for them with respect to the spectrum flexibility they’d have. They’re going to have to be in the market to buy incremental spectrum.”   The deal falling through might prompt Sprint Nextel Corp (S.N), the smallest of the top three U.S. carriers, to consider buying T-Mobile, a unit of Germany’s Deutsche Telekom AG (DTEGn.DE), he added.   AT&T shares fell $1.26, or more than 4 percent, to $28.35. Stock in rival Sprint rose 9 percent to $3.85.   The deal also would need the approval of the Federal Communications Commission, which regulates wireless telecommunications. On Wednesday, FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski said he is concerned about the deal’s impact on competition.   The lawsuit is the biggest challenge to a takeover by the Obama administration, which includes former AT&T executive William Daley as White House chief of staff.   “It’s mixed for Sprint. On the one hand, they were potentially going to lose T-Mobile USA as a competitor at the low end of the market,” Clement said. “Now it’s going to face a T-Mobile that’s in a better position prior to the merger proposal, with extra cash and spectrum and a new roaming agreement with AT&T.”  (Additional reporting by Diane Bartz in Washington and Nadia Damouni in New York.

162,VZ,"Court battle looms between U.S. and AT&T;, T-Mobile","NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Justice Department made a bold move when it sued to block AT&T Inc’s $39 billion acquisition of T-Mobile. Now comes the hard part: going to court.  The government is asking a federal judge in Washington, D.C., to stop the deal, and will have to prove that it would mean higher prices and less competition.  “This will be the Obama administration’s line in the sand. This will be their signature antitrust event,” said University of Baltimore law school professor Robert Lande.  AT&T has said it will fight the case, and its general counsel said it plans to seek an expedited hearing from the judge. Even so, experts say, the company could decide that it is not worth the expense and uncertainty to go to trial.  An AT&T spokeswoman declined to comment.  Two big communications deals, MCI’s proposed takeover of Sprint in 1999 and EchoStar Communications Corp’s deal to buy Hughes Electronic Corp’s DirecTV in 2001 fell apart after the Justice Department challenged the deals.  “A preliminary question is whether AT&T will go to court. It’s certainly not uncommon for companies to look at this and decide that the game isn’t worth the gamble,” said David Smutny, an antitrust lawyer with Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe.  The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle, who also oversaw the EchoStar-Hughes antitrust court challenge. Huvelle was appointed to the bench in 1999 by then President Bill Clinton.  In pre-trial proceedings in that case, Huvelle had harsh words for the way both companies responded to regulators’ information requests, calling them “sluggish.”  Any trial in the AT&T case would be lengthy and complicated, with experts predicting that both sides would put on a parade of witnesses including consumers, economists, and possibly competitors or state regulators.  In its complaint, the Justice Department argued that AT&T has overwhelming power in the national market — it is one of four major carriers — and that the market for mobile telecommunications would be highly concentrated in 96 of 100 U.S. cell phone market areas.  AT&T is likely to argue that the deal would create efficiencies in terms of price, quality and innovation — and maybe even jobs, said Lande, the Baltimore professor.  “Very few efficiency defenses work,” said Lande, who praised the Justice Department for bringing the action. “They make promises that these efficiencies could happen, but showing that in court is very difficult.”  While most antitrust attorneys declined to say how they thought the case would be decided, Howard University law professor Andy Gavil said he thought the judge would block the deal. “Having read the complaint, I don’t see a basis for a negotiated settlement,” said Gavil, who testified to Congress on the deal.  Two other veteran Washington antitrust attorneys, who declined to be identified because of potential conflicts involving their law firms and companies in the case, told Reuters they think the deal will be stopped, either because the court blocks it or because AT&T drops its bid.  If the case goes to trial, there may be no quick end. The losing side is likely to appeal.  “You could have a situation here where the combined litigation and regulatory process could extend for several months or years,” said Maury Mechanick, a telecommunications attorney at law firm White & Case.  “From a business practicality perspective, is that a delay that AT&T and T-Mobile can tolerate?” said Mechanick. “That’s ultimately a judgment that they will have to make.”  The case is USA v. AT&T Inc et al, U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, No. 11-cv-1560.

164,VZ,"With no ""Plan B,"" stark choices face D.Telekom","BERLIN (Reuters) - The U.S. block on Deutsche Telekom’s $39 billion sale of its U.S. unit throws CEO Rene Obermann’s strategy into disarray and may force him to throw money at a business he thought he was rid of.  The announcement by the U.S. Department of Justice on Wednesday that it was suing to prevent AT&T Inc’s purchase of T-Mobile USA caught Obermann and his management team by surprise. Company officials say they have no “Plan B,” beyond fighting to keep the deal on track.  Should it collapse, as many analysts and bankers believe it will, sources close to the company say Deutsche Telekom would be faced with a stark choice: seek another buyer at a lower price, or hang onto it and invest 10s of billions of euros to restore its competitiveness.  Bleeding money and losing customers, T-Mobile USA ranks fourth among U.S. carriers behind AT&T, Verizon and Sprint.  “Without a deal, there’s every chance T-Mobile will just cease to exist if you fast-forward three years,” said an equities fund manager who holds both Deutsche Telekom and AT&T stock.  Analysts at Bernstein Research said the deal with AT&T was “all but dead in the water,” so to avoid oblivion, Obermann has to invest.  That could mean he needs to cut the dividend of 70 euro cents per share after next year, several sources said. The dividend is a main draw for buyers of the firm’s stock.  “No third party is going to step in, nobody will come in and take (T-Mobile USA) off Deutsche Telekom’s hands,” a senior source with close ties to the company told Reuters.  “Obermann did not supervise the U.S. business and completely left it on the side until it fell apart,” the source added. “He got to the point where there was no other option but a fire sale.”  The youngest CEO of a major German company when he took the helm of Bonn-based Deutsche Telekom in November 2006, Obermann was seen as a risk-averse manager until he surprised investors with the AT&T mega-deal in March.  Months after taking charge, he said his success should be measured by the company’s share price. That has fallen from roughly 13 euros when he was appointed to below 9.  HOLLYWOOD-STYLE FIGHT  Despite the pressure on him, Obermann is likely to hang onto his job for now, sources predicted. The German government, which owns roughly a third of the company’s shares, has little interest in pushing him out, so long as he refrains from major job cuts and maintains good relations with unions.  But the company’s longer term future is less clear.  A second source, who advises Deutsche Telekom, said up to a year of haggling with U.S. authorities was likely, and that AT&T would have to sell “a lot” of assets to satisfy the U.S. Department of Justice and win approval for the deal.  Justice officials have said the deal, as it currently stands, would be disastrous for consumers, leading to higher prices, lower quality and less innovation.  “It will be a tough Hollywood-style fight about the remedies,” the second source said. “The fallback options are all worse than Plan A, so they will fight for the original plan.”  As part of the AT&T deal, Deutsche Telekom secured a breakup fee and benefits of $6 billion should regulators reject the deal. That gives the company some leeway in the short-term, but won’t resolve its longer-term financial issues.  Deutsche Telekom had planned to use the proceeds from the sale to pay down debt, launch a 5 billion euro ($7.2 billion) share buyback program, and step up investments at home and in Europe. These plans are all at risk now.  Obermann inherited the U.S. business from former CEO Ron Sommer, who in 2000 bought what was then called Voicestream for $50 billion.  The move was much criticized at the time, but rebranded as T-Mobile USA, the business became a cash cow for Deutsche Telekom, before sputtering in recent years.  Looking for a boost, Obermann came close to buying U.S. rival Sprint in 2008, but backed off amid concerns the German government would not support a deal and worries about the compatibility of the two firms’ network technology.  Ironically, the only company that might consider stepping into AT&T’s shoes and purchasing T-Mobile would be Sprint, although technology issues would still make such a move difficult.  “Sprint is the only one left that can buy it,” the first source said. “Sprint could put something low on the table, like $20 billion, with a deadline.”  Should Obermann fail to find a new buyer, the choices are probably invest in the business or watch it wither.  “It flounders, succumbs to customer churn and potentially at a much lower valuation, someone like Carlos Slim might buy it and go for a value play,” said Michael Kovacocy, an independent London-based telecommunications analyst. He was referring to the Mexican entrepreneur who Forbes magazine ranks as the world’s richest man.  “From Deutsche Telekom’s point of view (the AT&T deal) was almost a dream come true: someone was willing to pay a substantial premium to what T-Mobile would have been worth as a stand-alone.” ($1 = 0.695 Euros)  ",9012011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-deutschetelekom-att/with-no-plan-b-stark-choices-face-d-telekom-idUSTRE7803IR20110901

166,VZ,U.S. moves to block AT&T;'s purchase of T-Mobile,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Wednesday sued to block AT&T Inc’s $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile USA, citing concerns it will harm competition in the wireless market and lead to higher prices.  The surprise move, which was the biggest antitrust challenge yet by the Obama administration, caught the carriers by surprise and if successful would end AT&T’s move to unseat Verizon Wireless as the No. 1 U.S. mobile carrier.  If AT&T fails to defeat the Justice Department lawsuit, it will prove very costly — the No. 2 carrier would have to pay T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom an estimated $6 billion in cash and other assets as part of the original deal.  The announcement is a slap in the face for AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson, who was poised for a career-defining deal that would allow him to emerge from the shadow of predecessor and serial acquirer Ed Whitacre.  The court case could take months and cost millions of dollars. Wall Street immediately signaled the deal was likely now a longshot, with shares in the companies falling sharply.  Justice Department officials warned that allowing AT&T to gobble up the No. 4 carrier would be disastrous for consumers.  “Were the merger to proceed, there would only be three providers with 90 percent of the market, and competition among the remaining competitors on all dimensions, including price, quality and innovation, would be diminished,” Deputy Attorney General James Cole told reporters.  The lawsuit came only five months after the deal was announced and despite the surprising timing, one source close to the case said it was a real attempt to halt a “fundamentally flawed” deal, not a tactic to wring big concessions from AT&T.  They would have to give up “so much” to win approval, the source said. Still, Justice Department officials said they were willing to consider proposals to ameliorate their concerns, but they expected to the fight to shift to federal court.  A source close to one of the carriers said they may have to offer to divest up to 25 percent of the combined company’s assets, up from an earlier estimate of up to 10 percent, to try to save the deal.  James Ratcliffe, an analyst at Barclays Capital slashed his expectations that the deal would win approval to a range of 35 percent to 40 percent, down from 75 percent.  The government’s lawsuit overshadowed an announcement just hours earlier by AT&T that it would bring back 5,000 call center jobs to the United States if the deal closed.  Just a day ago, the two sides had met to continue discussions on the merger and the Justice Department dropped no hints that it was getting frustrated with the talks.  The two sides were “talking past each other,” said one source familiar with the case, adding that the Justice Department side felt that nothing was really presented to address their competition concerns.  AT&T’s Stephenson has argued that his company needs T-Mobile to get more wireless airwaves to meet exploding demand for high-speed mobile services from smartphones and tablets.  Stephenson put himself on the line with this deal so he has no choice but to double down, said a person close to AT&T. [ID:nN1E77U26Q]  Shares of AT&T closed down 3.8 percent at $28.48 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Deutsche Telekom shares fell 7.6 percent to 8.81 euros in Frankfurt trade.  “This one took everybody by surprise,” said a person close to one of the carriers, adding that they thought the Justice Department would ask for concessions but not derail the deal.  Meanwhile shares of Sprint Nextel Corp — the No. 3 U.S. wireless carrier, which has fiercely opposed the deal — shot up almost 6 percent to close at $3.76. A scuppered acquisition could prompt Sprint to consider buying T-Mobile.  AT&T’s high-powered lobbying team in Washington is led by Jim Cicconi, who previously worked in the Reagan and Bush administrations.  “We thought the weight of AT&T’s lobbying was having some success; this very much undermines that. It’s very uncertain where this leaves us at the moment,” said Andrew Hogley, telecom analyst at Espirito Santo investment bank.  If the government succeeds in blocking the deal, it would also be a major setback for Deutsche Telekom, which for years has been looking for a way out of T-Mobile USA, a business that has ceased to be a source of growth.  Deutsche Telekom “will gain some short-term consolation from the penalties it can exact from AT&T,” said John Delaney, an analyst at technology research firm IDC. “But in the end, DT would still be stuck with the problem of how to turn around a sub-scale national operator with a declining subscriber base.”  The news also sent chills through the mergers and acquisitions market. Not only do the seven investment banks that advised on this deal stand to lose about $150 million in fees, but bankers elsewhere were also worried it could make companies think twice about antitrust risk when mulling takeovers.  Antitrust experts saw this case as the signature antitrust event for the Obama administration, which includes former AT&T executive William Daley serving as White House chief of staff.  “This is an administration that came in saying it was going to have a more aggressive approach,” said Michael Sohn, an antitrust attorney with Davis Polk Wardwell LLP.  The administration has cleared some big deals like Comcast Corp’s purchase of NBC Universal, but Nasdaq OMX Group Inc and IntercontinentalExchange withdrew a hostile bid for NYSE Euronext after opposition from antitrust regulators.  “I think the court is going to block it,” said Andy Gavil, who teaches law at Howard University in Washington and testified to Congress on the deal. “Having read the complaint, I don’t see a basis for a negotiated settlement.”  One thing most experts agree on is that it would take a long time for the case to wind its way through the courts. The question remains whether the companies are willing to pursue that route and for how long, or go their separate ways.  Another complicating factor is that the deal also needs approve by the Federal Communications Commission, which regulates wireless communications.  “Although our process is not complete, the record before this agency also raises serious concerns about the impact of the proposed transaction on competition,” said FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski.  The case is USA v. AT&T Inc et al, No. 11-cv-1560 in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

167,VZ,UPDATE 6-U.S. moves to block AT&T;'s purchase of T-Mobile," * Acquisition would drive up prices, hurt competition -DOJ   * AT&T says to fight DOJ decision in court   * FCC has made no decision but cites “serious concerns”   * AT&T shares close down 3.8 pct, DT shares down 7.6 pct  (Adds more analyst comment, updates shares)   By Jeremy Pelofsky and Sinead Carew   WASHINGTON/NEW YORK, Aug 31 (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Wednesday sued to block AT&T Inc’s (T.N) $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile USA, citing concerns it will harm competition in the wireless market and lead to higher prices.   The surprise move, which was the biggest antitrust challenge yet by the Obama administration, caught the carriers by surprise and if successful would end AT&T’s move to unseat Verizon Wireless as the No. 1 U.S. mobile carrier.   If AT&T fails to defeat the Justice Department lawsuit, it will prove very costly — the No. 2 carrier would have to pay T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE) an estimated $6 billion in cash and other assets as part of the original deal.   The announcement is a slap in the face for AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson, who was poised for a career-defining deal that would allow him to emerge from the shadow of predecessor and serial acquirer Ed Whitacre.   The court case could take months and cost millions of dollars. Wall Street immediately signaled the deal was likely now a longshot, with shares in the companies falling sharply.   Justice Department officials warned that allowing AT&T to gobble up the No. 4 carrier would be disastrous for consumers.   “Were the merger to proceed, there would only be three providers with 90 percent of the market, and competition among the remaining competitors on all dimensions, including price, quality and innovation, would be diminished,” Deputy Attorney General James Cole told reporters.   <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   Take a look at related stories             [ID:nN1E77U1VX]   Graphic on telecom tie-up      r.reuters.com/wuj68r  Reuters Insider             link.reuters.com/dak53s  Breakingviews-Watchdogs call AT&T wager    [ID:nN1E77U0WC]   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>   The lawsuit came only five months after the deal was announced and despite the surprising timing, one source close to the case said it was a real attempt to halt a “fundamentally flawed” deal, not a tactic to wring big concessions from AT&T.   They would have to give up “so much” to win approval, the source said. Still, Justice Department officials said they were willing to consider proposals to ameliorate their concerns, but they expected to the fight to shift to federal court.   A source close to one of the carriers said they may have to offer to divest up to 25 percent of the combined company’s assets, up from an earlier estimate of up to 10 percent, to try to save the deal.

168,VZ,Waiting for good news? So are employers,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - If you take one open job, and one ideal job candidate, how many rounds of interviews will it take for that person to get hired?  The answer is three. It often takes three rounds of job interviews before a job is filled, according to U.S. staffing giant ManpowerGroup, whose experience finding people for its clients to hire helps illustrate the stalled U.S. jobs market.  “We’ll bring a candidate forward and they’ll interview the candidate three times,” Manpower Chief Executive Jeff Joerres said on Friday. “They’re hedging their bets always, they’re waiting for the perfect candidate — and in the meantime they’re saving money.”  The U.S. Labor Department earlier reported that employment growth ground to a halt in August and the unemployment rate held steady at 9.1 percent.  Manpower’s Joerres described a cautious environment, as companies await concrete signs that demand is returning for their goods and services. Employers are also uncertain over whether the Obama Administration will embrace pro-business policies.  They were also spooked last month by issues as varied as the government debt limit impasse, the downgrade of U.S. credit, Europe’s debt crisis, and the stock market decline.  “Companies have the ability to make very fast moves, in decreasing or increasing hiring, and right now they’re in pause mode,” Joerres said.  Still, a pause is better than some alternatives, Joerres said, noting that without a strike at Verizon Communications, the U.S. economy would have added jobs last month.  UNLIKELY DOUBLE-DIP  Staffing industry executives and analysts say Friday’s labor data actually supports arguments that a double-dip recession is unlikely, because temporary jobs continue to be added.  “We’ve been hearing a lot of chatter about a double dip recession, but for right now there’s no indication in the labor market to expect one,” said Tig Gilliam, who heads North American operations at Adecco SA, the world’s largest temp staffing provider. “Companies are not letting temporary workers go in large numbers as they have in the past.”  Friday’s government report showed 4,700 temp jobs added last month, more than in the July, and the percentage of temps in the overall labor force rose slightly. Analysts have said this so-called “penetration rate,” currently 1.7 percent, will likely surpass its peak in the prior economic cycle of just over 2 percent.  “Our business is still positive but nobody will commit on a permanent basis,” said Roy Krause, CEO of SFN Group Inc, which will become part of Randstad Holding NV once a takeover closes.  Krause said small business owners are concerned about access to credit.  “Banks have all kind of money, the question is whether they’ll lend it to you,” he said, adding he put chances of a new recession at 25 percent or less.  Staffing shares were lower across the board in Friday afternoon trading. Manpower lost 3.5 percent to $37.89, Robert Half International Inc fell 3 percent to $22.64 and Kelly Services Inc fell 3.7 percent to $13.92. In Europe, Randstad fell 3.4 percent and Adecco lost 6.5 percent.  The next data point for investors in the employment services sector will be U.S. President Barack Obama’s speech next Thursday, in which he’s expected to announce steps to support job creation. But any new policy steps would take months to implement and so would have little effect on near-term jobs trends, industry executives said.  “I don’t think we should be waiting for the President’s speech to see if we’ll be saved in September,” said Manpower’s Joerres. “It’s just not that simple.”  ",9022011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-staffing-outlook/waiting-for-good-news-so-are-employers-idUSTRE7814TU20110902

170,VZ,"Court battle looms between U.S. and AT&T;, T-Mobile","NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Justice Department made a bold move when it sued to block AT&T Inc’s $39 billion acquisition of T-Mobile. Now comes the hard part: going to court.  The government is asking a federal judge in Washington, D.C., to stop the deal, and will have to prove that it would mean higher prices and less competition.  “This will be the Obama administration’s line in the sand. This will be their signature antitrust event,” said University of Baltimore law school professor Robert Lande.  AT&T has said it will fight the case, and its general counsel said it plans to seek an expedited hearing from the judge. Even so, experts say, the company could decide that it is not worth the expense and uncertainty to go to trial.  An AT&T spokeswoman declined to comment.  Two big communications deals, MCI’s proposed takeover of Sprint in 1999 and EchoStar Communications Corp’s deal to buy Hughes Electronic Corp’s DirecTV in 2001 fell apart after the Justice Department challenged the deals.  “A preliminary question is whether AT&T will go to court. It’s certainly not uncommon for companies to look at this and decide that the game isn’t worth the gamble,” said David Smutny, an antitrust lawyer with Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe.  The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle, who also oversaw the EchoStar-Hughes antitrust court challenge. Huvelle was appointed to the bench in 1999 by then President Bill Clinton.  In pre-trial proceedings in that case, Huvelle had harsh words for the way both companies responded to regulators’ information requests, calling them “sluggish.”  Any trial in the AT&T case would be lengthy and complicated, with experts predicting that both sides would put on a parade of witnesses including consumers, economists, and possibly competitors or state regulators.  In its complaint, the Justice Department argued that AT&T has overwhelming power in the national market — it is one of four major carriers — and that the market for mobile telecommunications would be highly concentrated in 96 of 100 U.S. cell phone market areas.  AT&T is likely to argue that the deal would create efficiencies in terms of price, quality and innovation — and maybe even jobs, said Lande, the Baltimore professor.  “Very few efficiency defenses work,” said Lande, who praised the Justice Department for bringing the action. “They make promises that these efficiencies could happen, but showing that in court is very difficult.”  While most antitrust attorneys declined to say how they thought the case would be decided, Howard University law professor Andy Gavil said he thought the judge would block the deal. “Having read the complaint, I don’t see a basis for a negotiated settlement,” said Gavil, who testified to Congress on the deal.  Two other veteran Washington antitrust attorneys, who declined to be identified because of potential conflicts involving their law firms and companies in the case, told Reuters they think the deal will be stopped, either because the court blocks it or because AT&T drops its bid.  If the case goes to trial, there may be no quick end. The losing side is likely to appeal.  “You could have a situation here where the combined litigation and regulatory process could extend for several months or years,” said Maury Mechanick, a telecommunications attorney at law firm White & Case.  “From a business practicality perspective, is that a delay that AT&T and T-Mobile can tolerate?” said Mechanick. “That’s ultimately a judgment that they will have to make.”  The case is USA v. AT&T Inc et al, U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, No. 11-cv-1560.  For the DOJ: Sharis Pozen, Joseph Wayland, Gene Kimmelman, Patricia Brink, Laury Bobbish, Claude Scott and Lawrence Frankel.  For Defendants: Not immediately available.

It’s a law enforcement action,” said White House spokesman Jay Carney. “The White House did not have a role in making the decision.”  Asked whether AT&T lobbyist Jim Cicconi had been to the White House on Thursday, Carney said he was not aware he had.

172,VZ,Sprint sues to block AT&T;'s proposed T-Mobile buy,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sprint Nextel sued to stop AT&T Inc’s $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile USA, staking out its own private antitrust claims alongside the U.S. government’s challenge to the deal.  Sprint, the No. 3 U.S. wireless carrier, filed its lawsuit in the same federal court that is to hear the U.S. Department of Justice’s case opposing the buyout. A fierce opponent of the deal, Sprint said the combination would lead to higher prices for consumers and create a duopoly between AT&T and Verizon Communications.  “AT&T’s proposed takeover of T-Mobile is brazenly anticompetitive,” Sprint said in court papers on Tuesday. Sprint said it would be marginalized by the buyout, and the deal “would force consumers to endure higher prices and be denied the fruits of vigorous innovation.”  Sprint may have filed its own case in the event that the Justice Department comes to a settlement with AT&T, said Eleanor Fox, a professor at New York University School of Law.  “It may want to have its action out there just in case,” she said.  A Sprint spokesman was not immediately available for comment. A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to comment on Sprint’s move.  In a statement, an AT&T spokesperson said the company would contest Sprint’s lawsuit.  “This simply demonstrates what we’ve said all along — Sprint is more interested in protecting itself than it is in promoting competition that benefits consumers,” said the spokesperson.  Sprint’s lawsuit was assigned to Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle in Washington, D.C. She was selected at random last week to preside over the Justice Department’s case.  The success of Sprint’s lawsuit may depend on whether AT&T can find a way to appease the government’s concerns over the deal.  It would be a “very uphill climb” for a competitor to block a merger that has been approved by the government, said Rebecca Arbogast, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus and a former division chief at the Federal Communications Commission.  “It’s meant to keep a challenge alive even if DOJ ends up settling with AT&T, Arbogast said.  The Justice Department, in a surprise move last week, filed a lawsuit challenging the AT&T deal. It argued that eliminating T-Mobile as a competitor would hurt consumers by raising prices. The government challenge came five months after the deal was announced.  AT&T has promised to fight the Justice Department in court. It has argued that the merger would let it add capacity and meet demand for high-speed wireless service.  Judge Huvelle ordered a status conference for September 21 in the government’s case and told the parties to come prepared to “discuss the prospects for settlement,” according to the court docket. She also ordered the parties to propose a schedule for the case by September 16.  In its suit, Sprint argued that if the deal goes through, a combined AT&T and T-Mobile would use its increased market position to exclude competitors.  A big part of Sprint’s concern, according to the company’s 68-page lawsuit, is its dependence on Verizon and AT&T roaming to provide service to customers when they are outside of a Sprint service area, and backhaul, essentially links from a remote site to a central site.  “With today’s legal action, we ... expect to contribute our expertise and resources in proving that the proposed transaction is illegal,” Sprint’s vice president of litigation Susan Haller said in a statement.  Sprint’s move could be aimed at keeping pressure on the Justice Department to continue pressing its court challenge to the deal, said Jeffrey Silva, a telecommunications analyst at investment research firm Medley Global Advisors.  “Some suits start out as litigation, they go head to head, but sometimes they end up in settlement,” Silva said. He said “Sprint would rather see this go in a linear fashion” toward blocking the deal.  If AT&T fails to get regulatory approval for the deal, it will have to pay T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom an estimated $6 billion break-up fee.  The case filed by Sprint is: Sprint Nextel Corp. v. AT&T Inc., U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.  For Sprint: Steven Sunshine, Tara Reinhart, Tiffany Rider, Tara Emory, Matthew Hendrickson, and James Keyte of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.  For defendants: Not yet available.  The U.S. case is USA v. AT&T Inc et al, U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, No. 11-1560.

173,VZ,VeriFone raises outlook on mobile payment hopes,"(Reuters) - VeriFone Systems Inc (PAY.N) posted better-than-expected quarterly results and raised its full-year outlook as it ropes in more customers for mobile payment technologies.  The credit card swipe machine maker is betting on strong demand for near field communication (NFC) technology that allows people to pay for their purchases by waving an NFC-enabled mobile phone.  VeriFone, whose customers are primarily financial institutions, payment processors, petroleum companies and retailers, is seeing growing demand for these mobile payment technologies in the United Kingdom ahead of the 2012 Olympics.  “In London we have now signed nearly 6000 taxis to five-year processing agreements. UK retailers continue to embrace contactless systems,” Chief Executive Douglas Bergeron said on a conference call with analysts.  The company continues to work with Google Inc (GOOG.O) to roll out the Google Wallet mobile payment service, which uses wireless NFC technology on mobile handsets.  “The next big phase of the Google rollout is currently planned for the end of the month where we go from hundreds of locations to tens of thousands of locations,” CEO Bergeron said on the call.  Verifone is also working with ISIS — a NFC-based mobile payment joint venture between AT&T (T.N), T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless (VZ.N) — and PayPal Inc bring mobile payments to point-of-sale terminals in 2012.  It has also won a $6.9 million contract with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of New York City to deploy 1000 of its TransitPAY systems on buses which allow NFC-enabled smartphone-based payments.  If initial rollouts lead to widescale deployment across the industry, the company’s revenue would grow by $100-$150 million in the U.S. and internationally.  The company expects fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of 49-50 cents per share on sales of $395-$400 million. Analysts were expecting a fourth-quarter profit of 49 cents, on revenue of $395.9 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  However, growth in North America will remain flat in the fourth quarter. Growth in the market will pick up next year, VeriFone said. It expects higher growth from Europe - especially from UK, France and Germany - and from emerging markets.  Verifone raised its full-year adjusted profit outlook to $1.88-$1.89 a share on sales of $1.289-$1.29 billion, from its prior forecast of an adjusted profit of $1.80-$1.83 a share on sales of $1.17-$1.18 billion.  For the full year, analysts were expecting a profit of $1.84 a share on sales of $1.27 billion.

The credit card swipe machine maker is betting on strong demand for near field communication (NFC) technology that allows people to pay for their purchases by waving an NFC-enabled mobile phone. 	   VeriFone, whose customers are primarily financial institutions, payment processors, petroleum companies and retailers, is seeing growing demand for these mobile payment technologies in the United Kingdom ahead of the 2012 Olympics.	   “In London we have now signed nearly 6000 taxis to five-year processing agreements. UK retailers continue to embrace contactless systems,” Chief Executive Douglas Bergeron said on a conference call with analysts.	   The company continues to work with Google Inc to roll out the Google Wallet mobile payment service, which uses wireless NFC technology on mobile handsets.	   “The next big phase of the Google rollout is currently planned for the end of the month where we go from hundreds of locations to tens of thousands of locations,” CEO Bergeron said on the call.	   Verifone is also working with ISIS — a NFC-based mobile payment joint venture between AT&T , T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless — and PayPal Inc bring mobile payments to point-of-sale terminals in 2012.	   It has also won a $6.9 million contract with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of New York City to depoly 1000 of its TransitPAY systems on buses which allow NFC-enabled smartphone-based payments.	   If initial rollouts lead to widescale deployment across the industry, the company’s revenue would grow by $100-$150 million in the U.S. and internationally. 	   The company expects fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of 49-50 cents per share on sales of $395-$400 million. Analysts were expecting a fourth-quarter profit of 49 cents, on revenue of $395.9 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 	   However, growth in North America will remain flat in the fourth quarter. Growth in the market will pick up next year, VeriFone said. It expects higher growth from Europe - especially from UK, France and Germany -  and from emerging markets.	   Verifone raised its full-year adjusted profit outlook to $1.88-$1.89 a share on sales of $1.289-$1.29 billion, from its prior forecast of an adjusted profit of $1.80-$1.83 a share on sales of $1.17-$1.18 billion.	  For the full year, analysts were expecting a profit of $1.84 a share on sales of $1.27 billion.

179,VZ,AT&T; fights back at U.S. challenge of T-Mobile deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AT&T Inc and T-Mobile USA fought back against the Justice Department’s challenge to their proposed merger, arguing the deal would “usher in more intense competition.”  AT&T and T-Mobile, owned by Deutsche Telekom AG, argued in a federal court filing on Friday that the massive $39 billion deal would free up spectrum and create new capacity for Americans whose mobile devices are transmitting increasingly large amounts of data.  “The Justice Department’s complaint fails to come to grips with the significant efficiencies this transaction will generate,” the companies said in their filing.  In the brief, AT&T asked the court to allow its purchase of T-Mobile to go forward and to require the Justice Department to pay its costs in the challenge.  The Justice Department filed a lawsuit aimed at stopping the deal last week, saying the acquisition of T-Mobile USA, the No. 4 carrier, by AT&T, the No. 2, would harm competition in the wireless market and lead to higher prices.  The department, in particular, seemed determined to preserve T-Mobile as an innovative, discount carrier that held down wireless prices.  Responding to that concern, AT&T said “T-Mobile is not a unique or material competitive constraint on AT&T.”  “T-Mobile has not been a meaningful or unique innovator in terms of network development and deployment, nor is it likely to become one in the foreseeable future,” AT&T said in the filing with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.  The deal partners took issue with the Justice Department’s review of the effect of the merger on a national basis instead of on a local basis. They argued that more than 90 percent of U.S. consumers currently have at least five wireless carriers to choose from in their local markets.  They also disputed the method the Justice Department used to analyze the deal, saying it was too simplistic.  If the merger goes through, AT&T will unseat Verizon Wireless as the No. 1 U.S. mobile carrier. Verizon Wireless is a venture of Verizon Communications Inc and Vodafone Group Plc.  “We continue to believe this transaction as currently proposed is anti-competitive and harmful to consumers,” Justice Department Spokesperson Gina Talamona said. “We will respond further in our court filing.”  The lawsuit is the biggest antitrust challenge yet by the Obama administration.

181,VZ,"Internap not for sale, bets on data center growth: CEO","(Reuters) - Internap Network Services Corp, a provider of services that help improve Internet connectivity, is not up for sale at a time when a wave of consolidation is sweeping through the fast-growing telecom networking industry.  Bankers and analysts had identified Internap as a potential target for bigger rivals amid a scramble to tap into strong demand for ‘cloud computing’ that allows remote access to computing power and data over the Internet.  “I am not shopping the company and we listen to any offers that come in and respond accordingly,” Internap’s Chief Executive Eric Cooney told Reuters.  Analysts reckon AT&T Inc, Windstream Corp, CenturyLink Inc and Frontier Communications are all on the prowl for takeover opportunities in the space.  “At this stage the best value for our shareholders is to continue executing our organic growth plan,” Cooney said.  A number of deals have been struck this year including Verizon Communications Inc’s $1.4 billion bid for Terremark and phone company CenturyLink Inc’s more recent $2.5 billion acquisition of Savvis.  “We believe Internap represents a compelling buy as it operates defensive telecom businesses with solid growth prospects, has no debt and the recent drop in the stock,” Clayton Moran, an analyst at The Benchmark Co, told Reuters.  Earlier this year, rival Rackspace also said it was committed to staying independent. Other players like Equinix, InterXion Holding NV and private firms SoftLayer Technologies Inc and Joyent are also considered attractive targets by some analysts.  Cooney was the former CEO of TANDBERG Television and oversaw its acquisition by Ericsson Group in 2007. He left TANDBERG to become Internap’s CEO in March 2009 and has been instrumental in driving growth in the company’s data center business.  Originally an internet protocol (IP) service provider, Internap began to provide its own data center services under CEO Cooney’s leadership. The company also did away with its business that was primarily selling data centers for other providers.  Internap is betting on growing demand for web-hosting in data centers — large warehouses lined wall-to-wall with powerful computer storage servers, marking a shift away from its other business, IP services.  “While the IP services is strategically important to us...in financial or revenue terms, the dollars of growth will come prominently from the data center side,” Cooney said.  The company’s revenue was almost equally divided between internet protocol (IP) services in its latest reported quarter on July 28. Its IP services revenue has stayed stagnant or declined over the past year, but its data center business has fared much better.  Cooney expects Internap’s data center business to outpace the market growth rate of 15-20 percent.  Demand for data center services has been driven by an explosion in telecommunications and the growing popularity of cloud computing.  “Increasingly we will look much more like Rackspace, Savvis or Terremark did before they got acquired, in terms of revenue and profitability growth,” he said.  Internap will add 42,000 square feet to build on its capacity of 141,000 square feet, as it eyes growth in 2012 and beyond.  The company’s shares have fallen about 38 percent since it posted its second-quarter results in late July. They closed at $4.54 on Friday on Nasdaq.

The Justice Department went to court last week to block the deal, and the Federal Communications Commission said it also had concerns about the deal’s impact on competition. [ID:nN1E77U1HR]   In a letter sent to FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski and Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday, Republican legislators requested a bipartisan briefing on what went into the decision to challenge the merger and whether the agencies considered the impact on jobs and economic growth.   Signed by House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton, House Subcommittee on Communications and Technology Chairman Greg Walden and committee Chairman Emeritus Joe Barton, the letter asked for a meeting within the next two weeks.   “It is clear that this is a complex transaction and it is important that government officials reserve judgment until all of the facts have come to light,” the letter said.   Deputy Attorney General James Cole said at a briefing on Aug. 31 that the merger would reduce competition in the wireless market on three levels: price, quality and innovation.   Lawmakers have no direct role in reviewing the merger that was proposed in March, but Congress, through oversight of the regulators and by holding hearings, can influence public opinion.   If approved as proposed, the merger would concentrate 80 percent of the U.S. wireless market in just two companies: AT&T/T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless, a venture of Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L).   AT&T argues the deal will help it provide faster service to more customers. Critics charge that less competition will increase prices and limit consumer choice.

And it said the workload for network repairs would not be back to normal for another two to three weeks.   The telephone company said the problems were limited to its wireline business and that its mobile network held up well and would report a good quarter.   After a two-week strike in August that involved about half of Verizon’s wireline workers, creating a backlog of work, Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee hit, increasing the repair load for the company’s wireline network.   The company estimates that the financial impact of all these issues was in a range of $200 million to $250 million.   About 45,000 Verizon wireline workers went on strike on Aug. 7, and the company drafted thousands of managers working overtime to try to cover for the strikers, who included customer service representatives and technicians.

190,VZ,Fifteen lawmakers ask Obama to OK AT&T; merger,"(Reuters) - Fifteen Democratic lawmakers asked the Obama administration on Thursday to approve AT&T Inc’s (T.N) proposed purchase of T-Mobile USA.  Representative Heath Shuler and 14 other Democrats sent a letter to President Barack Obama arguing that the deal, which would merge two of the four large national cellphone carriers, would reduce joblessness and encourage investment.  “We urge the administration to resolve expeditiously your concerns and approve the proposed merger between AT&T and T-Mobile USA,” they said in the letter dated Thursday.  The Justice Department has filed a lawsuit aimed at stopping the deal, saying the acquisition of T-Mobile USA by AT&T would lead to higher wireless prices.  The proposed deal would vault AT&T over Verizon Wireless, a venture of Verizon Communications (VZ.N) and Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L), into the No. 1 spot. T-Mobile USA is now owned by Deutsche Telekom AG (DTEGn.DE).  Sprint (S.N) is the third largest carrier.  The letter said the proposed deal should be approved since AT&T has pledged to bring back 5,000 jobs that it had moved overseas. The letter also pointed to a study showing that the deal could create 55,000 to 96,000 jobs during the process of integrating the two companies and doing needed upgrades.  The letter also noted AT&T’s pledge to extend high-speed Internet wireless coverage to 97 percent of all Americans.

193,VZ,Tyco to split into three companies; shares rise,"(Reuters) - U.S. conglomerate Tyco International TYC.N plans to split into three publicly traded companies, positioning itself for expected consolidation in its diverse businesses and potentially making it easier for its operations to be acquired.  Tyco’s move was seen as the final unwinding of an industrial giant that for a decade has worked to repair its image after a fraud scandal. Analysts and investors named global industrial names like Schneider Electric (SCHN.PA), General Electric (GE.N) and United Technologies (UTX.N) as potential buyers.  Tyco, which was built through acquisitions, said the split would allow its three businesses — ADT North America residential security, flow-control products and services, and its fire and commercial security business — to have more options for growth, both from within and through acquisitions.  Tyco, which has a market capitalization of about $20 billion, acknowledged the businesses could be sold and said it considered a break-up as much as four years ago before deciding to improve the businesses first.  Sum of the parts analyses of Tyco range widely, with some analysts estimating it is worth $50 a share or $23.2 billion. Others, including JPMorgan, put the value at $65, or $30 billion, based on prior security and flow control deals.  If acquirers were to bid for a piece of the company, Tyco would weigh any offers, “but that’s not our plan,” Chief Executive Ed Breen told analysts on a conference call.  “I’m a big believer there’s going to be consolidation in these industries ... and we want our businesses to be able to play in that environment,” Breen said.  Asked if one of the companies could be acquired immediately after the split, he replied, “That could happen.”  The move marks the final act of Breen’s nearly decade-long stewardship of a company he inherited in the midst of crisis, said Kent Croft, co-manager of the Croft Value Fund, a longtime Tyco shareholder.  “He’s done a very good job,” Croft said. “There’s nothing prohibiting someone from buying one of the companies.”  Tyco has been streamlining for a decade, “and this kind of completes it,” said Bryan Keane, co-manager of the Alpine Accelerating Dividend Fund, which holds Tyco shares.  Tyco was built up through acquisitions under former CEO Dennis Kozlowski, who is serving a prison sentence for fraud.  Shares of Tyco, which has outperformed the Standard & Poor’s 500 index under Breen, closed 2.4 percent higher at $44.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.  Individual pieces of Tyco could be attractive to a long list of acquirers, said analyst Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners.  “We see all three pieces as possible takeover candidates,” Sprague said.  The ADT business could be attractive to AT&T (T.N), Verizon (VZ.N), Comcast (CMCSA.O), Stanley Black & Decker (SWK.N) or a private equity buyer, he said.  Possible buyers for the commercial fire and security business include France’s Schneider, Germany’s Siemens (SIEGn.DE) and U.S.-based United Technologies, Honeywell International (HON.N) and Johnson Controls (JCI.N), Sprague said.  United Tech or GE could be interested in the flow-control business, he said, or the unit could merge with ITT’s flow unit, Flowserve (FLS.N) or Swiss-based Sulzer AG (SUN.S).  Although several companies with disparate businesses have moved to break up in recent months, analysts and investors said such moves are specific to each company and do not necessarily mark a wider shift away from the conglomerate model.  Consumer companies Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N and Ralcorp Holdings RAH.N, credit rating agency owner and book publisher McGraw-Hill MHP.N, and giant energy company ConocoPhillips (COP.N) have announced plans to split their businesses. Also, ITT Corp (ITT.N) plans to spin its defense and water segments into separate companies.  The break-up of Tyco is the latest step in a nearly decade-long transformation of the conglomerate. Breen first broke up the company in 2007, spinning off its electronics division, now called TE Connectivity (TEL.N), and its healthcare company, now named Covidien COV.N.  He greatly expanded the security business with the $1.9 billion acquisition of Broadview Security in 2010.  “Breen has once and for all buried the sad chapter of ... Kozlowski,” said Anthony Michael Sabino of St. John’s University’s Peter J. Tobin College of Business. “Breen came in, restored order, and got the ship back on course.”  Tyco expects to complete the split-up within a year. It estimated refinancing and other costs at $700 million.  Goldman Sachs and Lazard acted as financial advisers to the company.  The ADT North America residential business, which provides security and fire alarm systems in North America to more than 6 million homes and small businesses, will have annual revenue of about $3 billion and 16,000 employees. Plans call for it to be incorporated in the United States.  The flow-control business, with annual revenue of $4 billion and 15,000 employees, sells valves and thermal controls for energy and other markets. It is expected to be incorporated outside the United States.  Tyco will combine the remaining commercial security business with its fire protection segment to form the largest new company, with annual revenue of $10 billion and 69,000 employees. Breen may be nonexecutive chairman of this business, while taking supporting roles at the others.  Tyco’s commercial fire protection business sells fire detection and suppression systems, while the security business serves commercial, industrial and government customers.

195,VZ,Analysis: AT&T; may have to settle for weaker T-Mobile tie-up,"NEW YORK/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - If AT&T Inc fails to convince U.S. regulators that its proposed purchase of Deutsche Telekom AG’s T-Mobile USA should go ahead, the pair may end up having to settle for a lesser relationship.  While it wouldn’t be as attractive as an all-out marriage, a network partnership would sidestep the regulatory heat and give the spectrum-hungry companies more capacity to support high-speed wireless services, according to analysts.  “They’ve done a lot of work with AT&T figuring out the network synergies. They’d be able to achieve a significant amount of that without a merger,” said Roe Equity Research analyst Kevin Roe about Deutsche Telekom and T-Mobile USA.  The Justice Department filed suit on August 31 to block the $39 billon deal, citing concerns that it would raise prices for consumers and hamper competition.  AT&T would unseat Verizon Wireless as the No. 1 U.S. mobile service, and the top three U.S. providers would control 90 percent of the wireless market if the deal succeeds.  The companies are preparing to discuss settlement prospects with the Justice Department at a Wednesday court hearing. But the prospects for a quick settlement are not good.  One source close to the case said there has been no movement toward a settlement and that the deal would have to be substantially restructured to satisfy antitrust enforcers.  Most likely, Wednesday’s hearing will just focus on setting a trial date and not produce much settlement progress.  The stakes are high, because the attractiveness of the deal diminishes the longer it is held up in a regulatory review. AT&T has asked for a January 16 trial date, while the Justice Department is pushing for March 19.  People close to the deal say AT&T is working on two tracks, preparing to defend the acquisition in court while restructuring it to make it more palatable to regulators.  Deutsche Telekom is especially motivated for the deal to go ahead because it has already clearly indicated that it wants to exit the U.S. market. Without a good “Plan B,” it may be forced instead to stay and invest billions of additional dollars in T-Mobile USA to make it more competitive.  The company also has already laid out plans for spending the $39 billion — paying down some of its net debt of 42 billion euros, launching a 5 billion euro share buyback and investing in Europe.  “Unfortunately for them I don’t think there are any perfect options. They’re in a tough spot,” said Will Power, an analyst for Robert W. Baird & Co.  At the time it hammered out the AT&T deal, Deutsche Telekom said it had been in talks with five interested parties.  With the AT&T deal at risk, some of those parties — Verizon Communications, DISH Network and Sprint Nextel — are still interested in T-Mobile USA, according to a source close to the operator.  But if the Justice Department wins its case to block the sale to AT&T, the No. 2 U.S. mobile service, the victory could preclude at least two of those companies — market leader Verizon Wireless and No. 3 ranked Sprint — from swooping in with a counter offer for T-Mobile USA, the fourth biggest U.S. mobile service.  Another option would be for Deutsche Telekom to spin off the U.S. business as a separate publicly traded entity.  But this option, too, is plagued by problems because it would require big operating improvements at T-Mobile USA, which has been struggling with customer losses.  With few good options if the deal gets rejected, BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk said, Deutsche Telekom and AT&T may indeed move ahead with a network sharing agreement, even if it would less financially beneficial to AT&T than a merger.  Deutsche Telekom also could consider pursuing a network agreement with other companies besides AT&T.  Prior to the AT&T pact, T-Mobile USA had been in talks about a spectrum sharing agreement with Clearwire, Sprint’s wireless venture with cable operators and owner of one of the biggest U.S. spectrum holdings.  But such a deal would require a big investment from T-Mobile USA because Clearwire, which has a massive funding gap, would want an investment in return for access to its network.  That may leave AT&T as a less expensive network partner.  For now, Deutsche Telekom is obliged to act in earnest to get the deal done, especially if it wants to take advantage of the consolation prize — a break-up fee worth an estimated $6 billion, including spectrum and $3 billion in cash that it will get from AT&T if merger deal is not approved.  The break-up fee would give Deutsche Telekom some short-term leeway but won’t resolve its longer-term financial issues.

196,VZ,"HTC, Verizon bet on purple with Rhyme phone","NEW YORK (Reuters) - HTC Corp is hoping to attract fashion-conscious customers by adding color and accessories to its smartphones as it tries to expand into a new market segment amid slowing growth.  HTC said on Tuesday that its latest phone, the Rhyme, will sport three shades of purple and will come with three accessories, all for $199, when it launches on September 29 at U.S. market leading network Verizon Wireless.  “This phone is particularly important because we’re trying to attract a new type of consumer we don’t typically do business with,” Jason Mackenzie, HTC’s head of global sales told Reuters, adding that HTC phones have not previously been known for their looks, “HTC is known as being technology led.”  While HTC was one of the first phone makers to support Verizon’s fastest wireless data network, one drawback to the Rhyme is its lack of support for that network. But sticking with Verizon’s older network reduced the price, so that HTC could include the accessories for $199.  It also helped to keep the phone slim-looking, Mackenzie said at the device launch event, which was held in a New York shopping district, steps away from a major store of HTC’s bigger rival Apple Inc.  The Rhyme will come with three accessories: a docking station where the phone is laid to charge; a purple tangle-free headset; and a purple attachment called the charm, which can be clipped on a handbag and flashes to warn of an incoming call.  While the U.S. market is only getting the “plum” version of the phone, Taiwan-based HTC is selling two other colors overseas, a light gray version and an aqua-green model.  HTC has made a lot of progress developing its brand in recent years, but analysts say it needs new markets to sustain its growth as it faces intensifying competition from bigger rivals Apple, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and BlackBerry maker Research in Motion Ltd around the world.  Rhyme, which is based on Google Inc’s Android software, will be available globally weeks after the U.S. launch, HTC said.  NPD analyst Ross Rubin said Rhyme could potentially expand HTC’s reach among women, but he declined to speculate as to whether the new color scheme would appeal to them.  “It’s an interesting direction for HTC, which has built a lot of its reputation on attacking the high-end, addressing the fastest network available,” he said.  “This is a nice counterbalance to the Droid, which has had an uber-masculine campaign attached to it,” Rubin said referring to Verizon’s marketing of its Droid line-up of Android phones with ads featuring robots.

198,VZ,Justice won't brief lawmakers on AT&T; merger,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department will not hold a briefing for lawmakers to explain its decision to challenge AT&T Inc’s (T.N) purchase of Deutsche Telekom AG’s (DTEGn.DE) T-Mobile USA.  In a letter sent on Monday to House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton, the Justice Department said it could not disclose nonpublic information about a matter in active litigation.  The Justice Department filed suit on August 31 to block AT&T’s $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile, citing concerns that it would raise prices for consumers and hamper competition and innovation. The Federal Communications Commission said it also had concerns about the deal’s impact on competition.  Top Republicans in the House Energy and Commerce Committee earlier in the month requested a bipartisan briefing with DOJ and the FCC on what went into the decision to challenge the merger and whether the agencies had considered the impact on jobs and economic growth.  Sharing information outside of the judicial process creates “the risk that the public and the courts will perceive undue political and Congressional influence over litigation decisions,” Assistant Attorney General Ronald Weich said in the letter.  Lawmakers have no direct role in reviewing the merger that was proposed in March; but Congress, through oversight of the regulators and by holding hearings, can influence public opinion.  The deal would merge two of the four national wireless carriers, and vault current No. 2 AT&T over Verizon Wireless, a venture of Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L), into the No. 1 spot.  AT&T argues the deal would help it provide faster service to more customers.

199,VZ,US Justice won't brief lawmakers on AT&T; merger," * DOJ turns down Republican request for meeting on merger   * Says cannot share information about active litigation   By Jasmin Melvin   WASHINGTON, Sept 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department will not hold a briefing for lawmakers to explain its decision to challenge AT&T Inc’s (T.N) purchase of Deutsche Telekom AG’s (DTEGn.DE) T-Mobile USA.   In a letter sent on Monday to House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton, the Justice Department said it could not disclose nonpublic information about a matter in active litigation.   The Justice Department filed suit on Aug. 31 to block AT&T’s $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile, citing concerns that it would raise prices for consumers and hamper competition and innovation. The Federal Communications Commission said it also had concerns about the deal’s impact on competition. [ID:nN1E77U1HR]   Top Republicans in the House Energy and Commerce Committee earlier in the month requested a bipartisan briefing with DOJ and the FCC on what went into the decision to challenge the merger and whether the agencies had considered the impact on jobs and economic growth.   Sharing information outside of the judicial process creates “the risk that the public and the courts will perceive undue political and Congressional influence over litigation decisions,” Assistant Attorney General Ronald Weich said in the letter.   Lawmakers have no direct role in reviewing the merger that was proposed in March; but Congress, through oversight of the regulators and by holding hearings, can influence public opinion.   The deal would merge two of the four national wireless carriers, and vault current No. 2 AT&T over Verizon Wireless, a venture of Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L), into the No. 1 spot.   AT&T argues the deal would help it provide faster service to more customers.   The Justice Department said in the letter that it had considered the benefits touted by AT&T and T-Mobile, but those benefits did not outweigh the negative impact the deal would have on competition and consumers.   “Moreover, the Department observed that AT&T could obtain substantially the same network enhancements that it claims will come from the transaction if it simply invested in its own network without eliminating a close competitor,” the letter said.

201,VZ,Judge sets February 13 date for AT&T; antitrust trial,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge set a February 13 start for a trial over whether AT&T Inc can buy rival T-Mobile USA, a compromise between the companies’ desire for a quick resolution and the Justice Department’s request for more time to prepare its case.  U.S. District Judge Ellen Huvelle on Wednesday set aside up to six weeks for the trial in response to the Obama administration’s antitrust lawsuit against the deal. She will preside without a jury, as is typical for such cases.  There was no discussion of any settlement to avoid trial during the 80-minute preliminary hearing.  The Justice Department sued last month to block AT&T’s $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile, owned by Deutsche Telekom AG, arguing it would raise prices for consumers and hamper competition and innovation.  A key government concern is that T-Mobile, the No. 4 wireless carrier, generally costs less than other carriers so its disappearance could mean higher prices for wireless service.  AT&T, the No. 2 wireless carrier, has defended the transaction, saying it would bring 5,000 overseas jobs back to the United States and enable it to expand high-speed wireless Internet coverage to 97 percent of all Americans.  The trial date falls between the government’s request to begin March 19 and AT&T’s petition for a January 16 date. Lawyers for the parties said the matter was unlikely to need six weeks to present evidence or witnesses.  Mark Hansen, one of AT&T’s lawyers, had pressed the judge for a quick trial to provide certainty to the companies and the market, saying they were “already months beyond where we want to be.”  AT&T and T-Mobile could find it difficult to hold the deal together through a long proceeding and investors’ patience could wane. The combined companies would leapfrog Verizon Wireless, a venture of Verizon Communications Inc and Vodafone Group Plc, into the No. 1 wireless spot.  Even with an expedited trial, and if the companies lose before Huvelle, an appeals process could stretch into 2013, said Evan Stewart, an antitrust expert with law firm Zuckerman Spaeder LLP. The government could also appeal if it lost.  “The sooner this gets done, the better it is from AT&T’s perspective,” said Stewart. “All those uncertainties change your business model which affect your bottom line, which is bad news.”  Verizon said it will not get involved in the fight at this stage but Chief Executive Lowell McAdam said the U.S. government needs to find ways to make more airwaves available.  “If the government wants to stop a merger like that they need to step up and say this is how we’re going to get spectrum in the hands of people who can use it,” he said at a Goldman Sachs investor conference in New York.  NO MOVEMENT Toward SETTLEMENT  AT&T has said it is keenly interested in reaching a settlement that would lead to Justice Department approval, and has expressed confidence that the deal can go forward.  Since the lawsuit was filed, there has been no movement toward reaching a settlement and the deal would have to be substantially restructured in order to appease antitrust enforcers, one source close to the case said this week.  “We are hopeful that we can reach a solution with the Department of Justice that addresses their concerns, but if not, we will be well prepared for trial,” said AT&T spokesman Michael Balmoris.  If the deal is abandoned, AT&T is facing paying upward of $6 billion in cash and spectrum to T-Mobile.  The scheduling hearing was dominated by a related suit filed by No. 3 wireless carrier Sprint Nextel. Huvelle declined to consolidate the cases and set an October 24 date for arguments over AT&T’s planned motion to dismiss.  The judge said she planned to decide whether Sprint had the right to sue or not “as swiftly as possible.”  Seven states have joined the Obama administration’s challenge to the deal, but on Wednesday, 10 other state attorneys general urged that a settlement be reached so the deal could go forward.

203,VZ,Sprint CEO: 2011 targets exclude any iPhone launch,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sprint Nextel Corp would need to change its full year guidance for 2011 if the company started selling the Apple Inc iPhone, Chief Executive Dan Hesse said on Wednesday at a conference.  While Hesse declined to comment on whether Sprint will sell the next version of iPhone, he told a Goldman Sachs investor conference the company did not include iPhone sales in its previous guidance for 2011.  Many analysts expect Sprint will become the third U.S. operator to sell the iPhone when the next version is launched.  But all Hesse would say was that, in order to meet full-year targets, Sprint would just need to have a “very strong fourth quarter.”  Sprint, which has been struggling to retain customers, said in July it would add subscribers for the full year 2011 and that its profit would remain around the same as 2010.  AT&T BATTLE  The Apple iPhone is currently sold by AT&T Inc and Verizon Wireless, a venture of Verizon Communications Inc and Vodafone Group Plc.  Sprint, the No. 3 U.S. mobile provider, has been losing out to bigger rivals Verizon and AT&T, as well as smaller operators offering prepaid services for cost-conscious customers.  Hesse also spoke out against bigger rival AT&T Inc’s proposed $39 billion purchase of No. 4 U.S. operator T-Mobile USA, a Deutsche Telekom AG unit, saying it would hurt competition.  The U.S. Justice Department’s lawsuit to block the deal suggests the market needs four national wireless players, but Hesse said this does not necessarily mean it would block a deal among smaller services. Sprint had been in discussions to buy T-Mobile USA before Deutsche Telekom finalized the deal with AT&T in March, sources have told Reuters.  AT&T shot back at Hesse, arguing his comment showed the operator’s real motives for blocking the deal was self-interest rather than any concern about the health of the U.S. wireless industry.  “Now, Mr. Hesse’s public musings have made their motives much more clear,” said Jim Cicconi, AT&T vice president for legislative affairs. “That they would act in their own economic interest is not surprising. That they would expect the United States Government to be a willing partner certainly is.”  A U.S. court set February 13 as the date for a trial of the DoJs case against AT&T. It set an October 24 date for arguments in Sprint case against the deal. It did not consolidate the cases as Sprint had requested.  Sprint shares closed down 8 cents, or 2.4 cents, at $3.25 on New York Stock Exchange. AT&T shares were down 55 cents, or 1.9 percent, at $28.30.

207,VZ,UPDATE 1-Time Warner Cable sees stronger additions," NEW YORK, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Time Warner Cable TWC.N President Rob Marcus said his company had seen better subscriber growth in the current quarter as it steps up its marketing and customer acquisition strategy.   Marcus said the No. 2 U.S. cable operator had gained more high-speed Internet customers and lost fewer video customers in August and September than a year earlier.   His comments, made at a Goldman Sachs investor conference, could help ease investor concerns that cable operators would struggle with stiffer competition from satellite and phone companies as well as a weak U.S. economic outlook.   There had been some expectation that Time Warner Cable would benefit from a workers’ strike at rival Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) slowing down the phone company’s roll-out of its competing FiOS TV service. But Marcus said the Verizon strike had not been a significant factor in Time Warner Cable’s current quarter.   He said that phone additions continued to be softer than a year ago.   Marcus said a better focus on marketing and improved customer segmentation had helped the company retain and acquire customers.   Time Warner Cable is also seeing some success with smaller, lower-priced packages as a way to retain customers who may not be able to afford rising fees, Marcus said.   “The numbers are still pretty small,” he said, “but the results are significant enough that we’re going to roll it out more broadly.”  (Reporting by Yinka Adegoke; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)  ",9212011,http://www.reuters.com/article/timewarnercable/update-1-time-warner-cable-sees-stronger-additions-idUSS1E78K0TF20110921
208,VZ,"Verizon eyes margin improvements, labor contract"," * Sees improving margins   * Cites Oct 1 deadline for union proposal   * Eyes cutting business products from 4,000 to few hundred   NEW YORK, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications (VZ.N) is looking to boost profit margins in its traditional wireline telephone business through a new labor contract, restructuring its business services products and cost cuts in other areas, according to its Chief Executive Lowell McAdam.   McAdam said the company wants a labor contract that helps it operate more efficiently. He is also looking to cut costs by reducing the number of business products it offers from thousands to hundreds.   On the labor front McAdam said the company is making progress with unions representing 45,000 workers and expects them to come up with a proposal for a new contract that would address the concerns of both sides by Oct. 1.   “I’m encouraged over recent dialogue. The union, by October 1 has committed to giving us a proposal,” Chief Executive McAdam told the Goldman Sachs Communacopia Conference.   The company has been negotiating since late August after a two week strike. Verizon wanted big changes in areas such as benefits and work rules but the unions said it was asking for too many concessions all at once.   The biggest issue for the union is jobs because the company has outsourced a number of jobs in its telephone business.   For two weeks after technicians and customer service representatives walked off the job Verizon asked thousands of managers to try to cover for the striking workers.   McAdam said that while they were on strike duty, many managers had come up with suggestions about where the company could operate more efficiently and cut more costs.   “The strike was a great opportunity” from that perspective, McAdam said.   The executive said that Verizon is also looking for more efficiency in its business services division, which offers about different 4,000 products.   “We’re going to streamline those down to a few hundred,” McAdam said. “It’s our goal to expand margins on the wireline side.”  (Reporting by Sinead Carew; Editing by Derek Caney)  ",9212011,http://www.reuters.com/article/verizon/verizon-eyes-margin-improvements-labor-contract-idUSS1E78K0GP20110921

210,VZ,Softbank faces setback in Japan iPhone 5 shakeup,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Softbank Corp’s (9984.T) lucrative gig as the sole iPhone vendor in Japan faces trouble as rival KDDI (9433.T) hammers out a deal with Apple, a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday, while worries of lost sales sent Softbank shares sliding 12 percent.  The deal could be a boon to Apple (AAPL.O), whose customers would end up with a better network, but is expected to trigger a huge shake-up in the domestic mobile phone market over the next six to 12 months.  “Softbank may cut prices to prevent users who are unhappy about its network quality from fleeing to bigger KDDI, which could in turn lower rates,” said Michito Kimura, a senior market analyst at IDC Japan.  A new price war would likely embroil NTT DoCoMo (9437.T), which commands half of Japan’s cellphone market and has the potential to squeeze profits at handset makers.  The source said KDDI is working on a deal with Apple to sell the iPhone 5 in Japan. The online version of the Nikkei Business magazine had reported earlier that KDDI would begin sales of the iPhone 5 in Japan around November.  That report prompted investors to dump shares in Softbank, wiping out 354.5 billion yen ($4.6 billion) in market value. The 12 percent slide to a one-year low was the stock’s biggest single-day percentage drop since November 2008.  Spokesmen for KDDI and Softbank declined to comment, but Softbank said there was no clause in its contract with Apple that would prevent another carrier from offering the iPhone.  Analysts said KDDI’s success in wooing users away from Softbank, which has outpaced its competitors for the past 17 months in new signups, depended on pricing and how dissatisfied iPhone users were with Softbank’s network.  Softbank’s profits have ballooned since it introduced the iPhone in 2008, upsetting a market that had long been dominated by domestic handset makers.  Operating profit at the company, which bought Vodafone’s Japan business in 2006, rose to a record 629 billion yen ($8.2 billion) in the year ended in March 2011.  But many iPhone users in Japan have complained about the patchy network, stirring speculation that Apple would eventually allow other carriers to distribute its phones in Japan, a strategy it is already pursuing in the United States.  Expectations grew after media reported Apple was using a Qualcomm (QCOM.O) CDMA chipset for the iPhone 5, opening up the way for CDMA2000 network users such as KDDI to sell the popular gadget.  Apple has already expanded its vendors in the United States to Verizon Wireless, a venture of Verizon Communications (VZ.N), which also uses the CDMA200 network.  Shares of KDDI, which have risen more than 20 percent since mid-August, ended down 0.8 percent after gaining as much as 6 percent, while DoCoMo fell 3.2 percent.  “Selling the iPhone will bring more users to KDDI, but could also mean higher sales and maintenance costs,” one market participant at a securities firm said.  KDDI would likely need to adjust its network to support the iPhone, and this could mean that Softbank will begin selling the iPhone 5 before KDDI can.  Attention now is on whether NTT DoCoMo will also supply the iPhone in the future, said Hideyuki Ishiguro, a strategist at Okasan Securities, adding that this possibility was weighing on KDDI and Softbank shares.  DoCoMo’s smartphone lineup now includes handsets made by Samsung Electronics (005930.KS), Sharp (6753.T), Sony Ericsson and Toshiba (6502.T).

211,VZ,U.S. Internet rules to take effect November 20,"(Reuters) - Long-delayed U.S. Internet rules that tackle the controversial issue of balancing consumer and content provider interests against those who sell access to the Web will take effect November 20.  The Federal Communications Commission’s “open Internet” order was published in the Federal Register on Friday, and immediately drew threats of court and congressional challenges.  The rules were adopted by the FCC late last year after a lengthy debate, but only recently cleared a review by the White House’s Office of Management and Budget.  Criticized by opponents as a legally shaky government intrusion into regulating the Internet, the new rules forbid broadband providers from blocking legal content but leave flexibility for providers to manage their networks.  Broadband provider Verizon Communications Inc has been a vociferous opponent, and renewed its pledge to take the FCC to court as soon as the rules are published.  “We have said all along that once we see the publication ... we intend to file another notice of appeal,” Verizon spokesman Ed McFadden said.  For the past 10 years, the possibility of regulations to mandate the neutrality of the Internet — in terms of restrictions on content, sites, platforms and types of equipment that may be attached — has been the subject of fierce debate.  The latest rulemaking was prompted by a U.S. federal appeals court ruling last year that the FCC lacked the authority to stop Comcast Corp from blocking bandwidth-hogging applications on its broadband network.  The rules, adopted last December in a 3-2 vote, give the FCC power to ensure consumer access to huge movie files and other content while allowing Internet service providers to manage their networks to prevent congestion.  An FCC spokesman said the rules increase certainty and predictability, stimulating investment and ensuring job creation and economic growth.  But public interest groups criticized the rules as too weak, saying the FCC bent heavily to the will of big industry players including AT&T Inc and Comcast.

212,VZ,UPDATE 1-U.S. Internet rules to take effect Nov. 20," * Controversial rules published in Federal Register   * Court and congressional challenges loom   * Consumer groups say rules weak but will defend them  (Adds comments from FCC, public interest group, senator)   By Jasmin Melvin   Sept 23 (Reuters) - Long-delayed U.S. Internet rules that tackle the controversial issue of balancing consumer and content provider interests against those who sell access to the Web will take effect Nov. 20.   The Federal Communications Commission’s “open Internet” order was published in the Federal Register on Friday, and immediately drew threats of court and congressional challenges.   The rules were adopted by the FCC late last year after a lengthy debate, but only recently cleared a review by the White House’s Office of Management and Budget.   Criticized by opponents as a legally shaky government intrusion into regulating the Internet, the new rules forbid broadband providers from blocking legal content but leave flexibility for providers to manage their networks.   Broadband provider Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) has been a vociferous opponent, and renewed its pledge to take the FCC to court as soon as the rules are published.   “We have said all along that once we see the publication ... we intend to file another notice of appeal,” Verizon spokesman Ed McFadden said.   For the past 10 years, the possibility of regulations to mandate the neutrality of the Internet — in terms of restrictions on content, sites, platforms and types of equipment that may be attached — has been the subject of fierce debate.   The latest rulemaking was prompted by a U.S. federal appeals court ruling last year that the FCC lacked the authority to stop Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) from blocking bandwidth-hogging applications on its broadband network.   The rules, adopted last December in a 3-2 vote, give the FCC power to ensure consumer access to huge movie files and other content while allowing Internet service providers to manage their networks to prevent congestion.   An FCC spokesman said the rules increase certainty and predictability, stimulating investment and ensuring job creation and economic growth.   But public interest groups criticized the rules as too weak, saying the FCC bent heavily to the will of big industry players including AT&T Inc (T.N) and Comcast.   Matt Wood, policy director of public interest group Free Press, said broadband providers will be able to divide the Internet into “fast and slow lanes” and that the rules fail to protect mobile broadband users.   “Even in their watered-down form, the rules might do some good — but that would require a vigilant FCC to carefully monitor and address complaints,” Wood said in a statement, adding that he doubted the agency would do enough to protect consumers.

The regulations covering so-called Net neutrality, published in the Federal Register on Friday, are sure to trigger legal and congressional challenges.

214,VZ,Verizon takes Samsung's side in spat with Apple,"(Reuters) - Verizon Wireless, the biggest U.S. mobile provider, has taken a legal stand against Apple Inc’s request to ban the sale of some Samsung Electronics Co devices in the United States.  Verizon Wireless said that an injunction would stunt adoption of its high-speed wireless service, which is dependent on consumers being able to buy devices from vendors such as Samsung, which run on its high-speed network.  Apple sued Samsung in California on April 15 asking for a ban of its devices in the United States. Verizon made its filing ahead of an October 13 hearing in the case.  “The requested injunction of certain Samsung products will harm Verizon Wireless and U.S. consumers,” Verizon said in a court filing dated September 23.  “It also has the possibility of slowing the deployment of next-generation networks — such as Verizon Wireless’s — contrary to the stated goals of the U.S. government,” it said.  Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Other U.S. operators such as AT&T Inc, Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile USA did not immediately say whether they also plan to weigh in on the case.  Apple and Samsung have been locked in an acrimonious global battle over smartphone and tablet patents since April.

217,VZ,UPDATE 1-Consumer group challenges new U.S. Internet rules," * Free Press disputes distinction between wired, wireless   * More suits expected now rules published  (Adds details from court petition, FCC comment, background)   By Jasmin Melvin   WASHINGTON, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Public interest group Free Press mounted the first challenge to new U.S. Internet traffic rules since they were published last week, seeking to strengthen protections for wireless users.   The petition filed in the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston on Wednesday, challenges provisions in the Federal Communications Commission’s Open Internet order that give wireless broadband providers more discretion in managing their networks.   “When the FCC first proposed the Open Internet rules, they came with the understanding that there is only one Internet, no matter how people choose to reach it,” said Matt Wood, policy director for Free Press.   The rules, adopted last December by the FCC in a 3-2 vote, forbid broadband providers from blocking legal content while leaving flexibility for providers to manage their networks.   FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski supported giving wireless Internet providers even greater freedom to manage traffic, in recognition of wireless’ status as a younger technology.   Supporters of the wireless portion of the plan said it recognized the limited bandwidth available to support everything from telephone calls to movie downloads.   Public interest groups have criticized the rules as too weak, saying the FCC was swayed by big industry players including AT&T Inc (T.N) and Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O).   Free Press said it planned to show that no evidence in the record justified making a distinction between mobile and fixed Internet access.   The group said the leeway given to mobile broadband providers would allow them to “block innovative applications with impunity.”   “It’s especially problematic because of the increasing popularity of wireless, along with its increasing importance for younger demographics and diverse populations who rely on mobile devices as their primary means for getting online,” Wood said.   The so-called “net neutrality” debate pits content providers, who seek protection against the blocking or degrading of their services, against Internet service providers who often supply rival content.   Proponents of net neutrality rules say that these big providers could otherwise use their gatekeeper role to discriminate against competitors. Internet providers say they need to be able to manage their networks for all users.   An FCC spokesman said the rules have brought certainty and predictability, stimulating investment and innovation in mobile networks and applications.   “We will vigorously oppose any effort to disrupt or unsettle that certainty, which ensures that the Internet remains an engine for job creation, innovation and economic growth,” the spokesman said.   Further challenges to the Internet rules are expected.   Verizon Communications (VZ.N) and MetroPCS Communications PCS.N filed lawsuits earlier in the year, accusing the FCC of overstepping its authority.   Both suits were dismissed in April as premature by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit as the rules had not been officially published.   The rules were published last week, setting Nov. 20 as their start date.

218,VZ,Exclusive: Warburg Pincus considers Mach software sales: sources,"LONDON (Reuters) - Warburg Pincus is considering the sale of Mach, its Luxembourg-based business that provides roaming and billing services to mobile phone companies, four people familiar with the matter said.  The buyout firm has hired Barclays Capital (BARC.L) to review options for Mach, which could fetch around $750 million if sold and includes Telefonica (TEF.MC), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Verizon (VZ.N) among its customers, the people said.  Analysts said on Wednesday that Mach could be a target for software majors like Oracle ORCL.O and SAP (SAPG.DE) if Warburg Pincus presses ahead with a formal process.  U.S. business software company Tibco TIBX.O might also rank among the suitors, according to analysts.  No sales information had been sent out to potential buyers yet, and there is no guarantee that Warburg Pincus will ultimately sell, two of the sources said.  Mach has been in private equity hands for almost a decade and could appeal to other buyout firms as well, the people said.  There has been recent private equity activity in the mobile outsourcing sector, with Carlyle taking U.S. group Syniverse Technologies private earlier this year for about $2.6 billion.  Demand for mobile data services and new applications is soaring and telecom companies are increasingly outsourcing these functions to companies like Mach to improve service and cut costs.  Warburg Pincus bought Mach in 2005 from Advent International for an undisclosed sum, reported at the time to have been about 600 million euros ($820 million).  Since then, the buyout firm has continued to add to the business through bolt-on deals and mergers, taking over rivals including Evenex, Cibernet and Germany’s Optel Informatik.  Headquartered in Luxembourg, Mach has offices in 12 countries and serves over 650 mobile network operators, processing more than half of the world’s roaming calls, according to its company website.  Warburg Pincus declined to comment. Barclays could not be reached for comment.

219,VZ,Netflix shares fall as competition heats up,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) shares slumped 11 percent on Thursday as competitors made moves to attract more customers with alternative options for movie and television content.  Thursday’s losses added to a staggering drop for Netflix shares from a high of nearly $300 in July following a series of missteps. In afternoon Nasdaq trading, Netflix shares were down 11.4 percent at $112.62. That was 62 percent lower than July’s high.  Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) a day earlier unveiled a tablet computer called the Amazon Fire, a rival to Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) dominant iPad and another device to offer online streaming of TV and film entertainment.  The Amazon announcement, plus a report that Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) was planning to expand content available through its Xbox gaming console, likely weighed on Netflix shares, Merriman Capital analyst Eric Wold said.  “I think people are concerned about the competitive pressures,” Wold said.  “As more competitors add content and add new ways for consumers to access that content, it could pose a risk to Netflix.”  Wold has a “buy” rating on Netflix shares based on its position as an industry leader and long-term growth opportunities.  Bloomberg reported early on Thursday that Microsoft plans to offer online pay television service from Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) through the Xbox Live streaming service as soon as next week.  Netflix has stumbled with a series of missteps in the past few months. The company announced an unpopular price increase for DVD service in July, failed to secure content from cable channel operator Starz beyond February and lowered subscriber forecasts in the face of customer cancellations.  CEO Reed Hastings further angered customers by separating the DVD and streaming services on different websites.

220,VZ,Verizon asks court to halt FCC net neutrality rule,"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc on Friday asked a federal appeals court to block the Federal Communications Commission from imposing new rules on how Internet service providers manage their networks.  The FCC last Friday said its so-called net neutrality rules were scheduled to take effect on November 20.  These rules would forbid broadband providers from blocking users from accessing lawful content, such as movie files, while giving the providers flexibility to manage their networks and prevent congestion.  Critics call the rules an unwarranted government intrusion into regulating the Internet, including which content consumers may access and which companies may provide that content.  In a filing with the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., Verizon said the FCC was “arbitrary” and “capricious” and acted beyond its statutory authority in imposing the rules.  The rules “impose potentially sweeping and unneeded regulations on broadband networks and services and on the Internet itself,” Michael Glover, deputy general counsel at Verizon, said in a statement.  “Verizon is fully committed to an open Internet, he added.

222,VZ,Sprint to buy 30.5 million iPhones over 4 years: report,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sprint Nextel Corp shares fell more than 10 percent after a report that it committed to buy at least 30.5 million iPhones that would cost it about $20 billion in the next four years.  The deal also involves Sprint paying a subsidy of $500 per phone and the iPhone would not be profitable for the No. 3 U.S. mobile provider until 2014, according to a Wall Street Journal story that cited unnamed people familiar with the matter.  Sprint and Apple officials declined to comment. Sprint, which had about 32.9 million contract customers at the end of June, has not confirmed widespread speculation it will sell the next model of Apple Inc’s iPhone to be unveiled October 4.  On Monday investors fled Sprint, which has been losing customers for years, on concerns that such a commitment would thrash the operator’s profit margins which already trail well behind those of bigger rivals Verizon Wireless and AT&T Inc.  Pacific Crest analyst Steve Clement said that while Sprint investors had expected big costs related to the iPhone the $500 subsidy was a surprise. In comparison, Verizon and AT&T pay subsidies of $400 for each iPhone, he estimated.  “It puts more pressure on them than was previously expected,” Clement said.  Other than the iPhone, the typical smartphone subsidy is about $250, he noted.  A 30.5 million commitment over four years would represent 40 percent of Sprint’s typical phone sales to contract customers, Clement said. By contrast, the iPhone accounted for about 21 percent of Verizon Wireless’ phone sales to contract customers in the second quarter, he said.  “You’re displacing phones you’re subsidizing at a much lower level. That’s what’s bad about it,” said Clement.  He also noted that Sprint’s operating profit margins are already languishing in the mid-teen percentage range. Margins are closer to 45 percent for Verizon Wireless, and often approach 40 percent for AT&T.  On top of a hefty outlay for the iPhone, Sprint is planning to announce details of a massive network upgrade on Friday this week. It has estimated that the upgrade will require it to buy about $5 billion in new network equipment.  On top of that, it has to repay or refinance billions of dollars worth of debt that comes due in the next two years.  “It stretches them,” said Clement.  The reported iPhone deal with Sprint underscores Apple’s power in an industry where service providers generally call the shots because their level of promotion of a device often determines its success or failure.  For devices other than the iPhone, a carrier typically initially commits to and forecasts for up to six months of supply, according to a source at a global wireless distributor.  “Other manufacturers don’t get the same thing Apple gets in terms of commitments because the Apple product has such demand it sells itself,” said the source, who noted that a longer term pact may ensure a supply guarantee.  One factor that could work in Sprint’s favor in selling the iPhone compared with AT&T and Verizon is that it is the only one of the three that still offers new customers unlimited data use for a flat monthly fee.  But if it is expecting to replace practically all its contract customers with data-hungry iPhone customers over the next few years it is unlikely its network would be able to cope with the strain of having unlimited data plans.  “That probably does it for unlimited data on the Sprint network,” if the report is correct, said CCS Insight analyst John Jackson.  Sprint shares closed down 31 cents, or 10 percent, at $2.73 on the New York Stock Exchange after the report. Verizon Wireless is owned by Verizon Communications and Vodafone Group Plc.

By contrast, the iPhone accounted for about 21 percent of Verizon Wireless’ phone sales to contract customers in the second quarter, he said.   “You’re displacing phones you’re subsidizing at a much lower level. That’s what’s bad about it,” said Clement.   He also noted that Sprint’s operating profit margins are already languishing in the mid-teen percentage range. Margins are closer to 45 percent for Verizon Wireless, and often approach 40 percent for AT&T.   On top of a hefty outlay for the iPhone, Sprint is planning to announce details of a massive network upgrade on Friday this week. It has estimated that the upgrade will require it to buy about $5 billion in new network equipment.   On top of that, it has to repay or refinance billions of dollars worth of debt that comes due in the next two years.   “It stretches them,” said Clement.   The reported iPhone deal with Sprint underscores Apple’s power in an industry where service providers generally call the shots because their level of promotion of a device often determines its success or failure.   For devices other than the iPhone, a carrier typically initially commits to and forecasts for up to six months of supply, according to a source at a global wireless distributor.   “Other manufacturers don’t get the same thing Apple gets in terms of commitments because the Apple product has such demand it sells itself,” said the source, who noted that a longer term pact may ensure a supply guarantee.   One factor that could work in Sprint’s favor in selling the iPhone compared with AT&T and Verizon is that it is the only one of the three that still offers new customers unlimited data use for a flat monthly fee.   But if it is expecting to replace practically all its contract customers with data-hungry iPhone customers over the next few years it is unlikely its network would be able to cope with the strain of having unlimited data plans.   “That probably does it for unlimited data on the Sprint network,” if the report is correct, said CCS Insight analyst John Jackson.   Sprint shares closed down 31 cents, or 10 percent, at $2.73 on the New York Stock Exchange after the report.

224,VZ,Telcos eye small-scale fixes to help data crunch," * U.S., Europe operators adopt Wi-Fi, femtocells   * Aim to reduce network costs, delay need for 4G    By Leila Abboud and Marie Mawad	   PARIS, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Telecom operators are getting creative in the search for low-cost ways to keep up with booming data on mobile networks as declining sales mean they can ill afford to invest billions in the major network upgrades European authorities want.	   With the advent of smartphones and tablet computers, people increasingly use mobile networks to browse the web, play games and watch video. Traffic is expected to grow roughly 25-fold through 2015, putting an unprecedented strain on mobile networks initially designed to handle voice calls.	   To force the industry’s hand, European Commission regulators said on Monday that they would study whether to lower the prices big telcos can charge rivals to use their old copper networks as a way to spur faster broadband investments. 	   The industry fiercely opposes the proposal, saying the ensuing revenue hole would harm their ability to upgrade.  	   To keep up with growing traffic, firms are using smaller-scale fixes such as off-loading mobile traffic onto fixed networks via Wi-Fi or installing small mobile antennas in homes or offices to put off major upgrades to fourth-generation mobile gear, which can carry heavier traffic loads.  	   The approach reflects a new pragmatism among operators which were burned a decade ago when they invested heavily in third-generation mobile only to see little customer interest.	   They also have to protect cash flows in the face of weak consumer spending so they can pay generous dividends promised to investors who see telcos as utility plays.	   “In today’s climate, investors scrutinise every dollar operators spend on their networks, so the telcos are increasingly open to any tool that can help them move mobile traffic efficiently and cheaply,” said Thomas Wehmeier, analyst at research firm Informa.	   This reticence among operators worries European regulators, who fear the continent is falling behind on broadband and mobile infrastructure, potentially denting long-term competitiveness.	  	  While regulatory debates simmer, operators are seeking ways to squeeze better performance out of networks on the cheap.	   Philippe Keryer, head of equipment maker Alcatel-Lucent’s network business, says the end-game for operators is to use all kinds of spectrum — Wi-Fi and mobile — to carry data.	   “We are in the first stages of what will be a new model to make telecom networks more flexible and dynamic,” he said.	   Many operators are turning to Wi-Fi, a decades-old technology that uses radio signals to transmit and receive data over distances of a few hundred feet.	   AT&T adopted an aggressive Wi-Fi strategy several years ago once it became clear that its mobile network in big cities could not handle the vast traffic generated by Apple iPhone users.	   It cobbled together a nationwide Wi-Fi network by buying a company called WayPort that owned 20,000 hotspots in the U.S. and signing partnerships with companies like Starbucks, McDonalds and FedEx that offer Wi-Fi to customers.	   Then it began to give its smartphone customers free Wi-Fi access as part of their subscriptions, and simplified the sign-on system so it was easy for people to find and use Wi-Fi.	   “You hear much less about network problems at AT&T today than you used to, and the Wi-Fi system was a big part of that,” said Wehmeier.	   In the U.K., Telefonica’s U.K. unit O2 is building its own 	 nationwide Wifi network with 14,000 hotspots by 2013 to alleviate pressure on its mobile network, while France Telecom plans to open 7 million hotspots in France before year-end.	   Thierry Bonhomme, who heads France Telecom’s network investments, said 30-35 percent of traffic on mobile networks would eventually be offloaded to Wi-Fi. “People mostly use their mobiles and tablets at home and at work where Wi-Fi is available, and only a bit on the streets or in the metro.”	   Other operators like France’s SFR are pairing Wi-Fi	 offloading with a program to install so-called femtocells in homes or offices. 	   These small boxes, which essentially amplify mobile signals to improve coverage indoors, aren’t new, but their cost has fallen enough to interest operators.	   SFR recently said it would give them to mobile customers instead of charging 100 euros for them. The goal: keep people happy with the mobile service and less likely to leave for a rival. SFR aims to deploy some 100,000 femtocells next year.	   Thomas Jul, head of Europe for equipment maker Nokia-Seimens	 Networks , said he had seen a lot of interest from European operators in femtocells lately. 	   Research firm Informa expects femtocell deployments to grow from 2.3 million today to 48 million in 2014.	   These new approaches to running mobile networks are not without risk for operators, say sector executives and analysts.	   For example, Wi-Fi spectrum is public so operators cannot ensure its quality at all times. 	   Jul said such concerns had made some operators wary of these new approaches. However, “spectrum is king,” he said. “If you don’t have enough capacity, you don’t have a choice.”	 	  (Editing by Helen Massy-Beresford)	  ",10032011,http://www.reuters.com/article/telco/telcos-eye-small-scale-fixes-to-help-data-crunch-idUSL5E7KU2UU20111003
225,VZ,Sprint confirms plan to sell iPhone,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sprint Nextel confirmed that it will sell the next version of Apple Inc’s iPhone, ending months of speculation about whether it would become the third U.S. operator to sell the popular device.  But the No. 3 U.S. mobile provider would not say whether its iPhone would come with a flat-fee service for unlimited data use - an offering analysts see as Sprint’s only hope for making its iPhone more competitive than rivals.  Sprint shares closed up 5 percent after the confirmation, recouping some losses from the previous day when investors fled due to worries about the cost of the device to Sprint, which has been shedding subscribers and posting quarterly losses for several years.  While carrying the device should help Sprint keep subscribers from fleeing to other operators, some analysts worried whether the costs would outweigh the benefits because Apple phones come at a steep premium to other devices.  “This is a huge gamble for Sprint and people are justifiably worried that they won’t be able to make any money doing it. It’s not a company that’s in great financial shape right now,” said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Chris King.  Analysts questioned how Sprint will be able to find the money to pay a premium to Apple on top of its obligations to pay back billions of dollars in debt and its plan to spend about $5 billion on an network upgrade in coming years.  The day before the phone was announced Sprint shares fell 10 percent after a Wall Street Journal report that the money-losing company committed to buy 30.5 million iPhones from Apple over the next four years and would pay $500 to subsidize each phone, leading it to lose money on the device until 2014.  Sprint and Apple have declined to comment on that story.  But since carriers always end up paying a premium for Apple phones, the addition of a third U.S. iPhone distributor also highlights Apple growing power in the U.S. wireless market, said Pacific Crest analyst Steve Clement.  “The more skews Apple has out there and the more distribution partners, the more market share they’ll take. It’s generally taking more profits from the carriers,” he said.  On top of this worry investors and gadget fans were less than enthusiastic about the iPhone 4 product upgrade that Apple unveiled on Tuesday.  AT&T Inc, Verizon Wireless — a venture of Verizon Communications and Vodafone Group Plc — and Sprint are expected to begin taking pre-orders for the iPhone 4S on October 7.  Unlike Sprint, neither Verizon nor AT&T offer unlimited data services. Analyst John Jackson of CCS Insight was skeptical that enough consumers would move from AT&T or Verizon Wireless to Sprint to make the expense worthwhile.  “Even with unlimited data Sprint will have a challenge here,” Jackson said. “Will it be sufficient mass to move the needle? I think it’s questionable.”  Concerns about Sprint also dragged down Clearwire Corp, which is majority-owned by Sprint. Clearwire, which needs billions of dollars in funding to finish building its own network, saw its shares fall 11 percent to $2.15 on Nasdaq.  Worry about Sprint may put Clearwire’s “viability into question, especially if you thought Sprint was going to wind up buying them,” Stifel’s King said.  Sprint shares closed up 5 percent at $2.86 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday but were still below their $3.04 close on Friday before the Wall Street Journal report about Sprint’s commitment to Apple.

227,VZ,Level 3 says to cut hundreds of jobs in U.S.,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Level 3 Communications Inc LVLT.O expects to lay off hundreds of employees, mostly in the United States, as part of its effort to integrate its $1.9 billion Global Crossing purchase, a top executive said.  “In large parts of the world it is very minimal. Here in the U.S. there will be some job cuts.” Chief Executive James Crowe told Reuters in New York.  Level 3, which has 11,000 employees, on Monday announced the closing of its Global Crossing deal and its plans to switch to the New York Stock Exchange from the Nasdaq.  In April, Level 3 bought smaller rival Global Crossing Ltd to strengthen its fiber-optics networks business and expand into Europe and Latin America.  “We want to keep the top line growing. The cost savings will come, but we are not in a hurry to have all the cost savings in the first week,” Crowe said.  Chief Financial Officer Sunit Patel said cash benefits will start appearing on Level 3’s bottom line in 2013.  Level 3 operates fiber-optic networks in the United States, Europe and Latin America and is looking to enter the African market. In the United States, the fiber infrastructure market is dominated by AT&T (T.N) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N).  The network provider said it is looking beyond streaming movies and providing video over its network to content distribution over smartphones.  “Our presence with content distribution to mobile devices is where we want to go over the next five to 10 years. Today it is still about broadband to home and enterprises, but over time mobile devices would be your primary interface,” he said.  Level 3 provides the network backbone that Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) uses to stream its video-on-demand service, a market where it competes with Akamai Technologies Inc (AKAM.O) and Limelight Networks Inc (LLNW.O).  Its content delivery business accounts for only about 2 percent of its core network services revenue, offering wide a berth for growth.  Crowe said the launch of new smartphones and tablets would help Level 3. “About 1 to 2 percent of the total Internet network traffic comes from mobile devices, but the traffic from these devices is growing well over 100 percent a year.”  The company is also eyeing growth in the enterprise segment, to help companies to put up more video content on their websites, among other things.  “We now have 1,000 sales people with the Global Crossing acquisition to sell that product not just to Netflix or Major League Baseball or HBO but to our entire market,” Crowe said.  Level 3 said it is not seeing any effect of the economic slowdown that is putting pressure on the United States and Europe.  “If we didn’t read the newspapers or watch TV, we wouldn’t know that there is a financial problem at the moment,” Crowe said.  “Other non-At&T, non-Verizon companies are saying the same thing: business is fine.”  Level 3 shares were up 4 percent at $1.47 in afternoon trade on the Nasdaq.

228,VZ,UPDATE 1-Apple to showcase new iPhone after 15-month hiatus," * New phone expected to be faster with bigger screen   * Apple event starts at 1 pm Eastern  (Adds share prices, details on Google rivalry)   By Poornima Gupta   SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is set to unveil the fifth iteration of the iPhone on Tuesday after a 15-month hiatus, hoping to fend off hard-charging Android rivals and safeguard its lead in the smartphone market.   The new iPhone comes at a critical juncture as Android phones from Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and other competitors close in on Apple’s lead.   Android phones now collectively hold more than four-fifths of the U.S. market, a mere three years after Google Inc (GOOG.O) launched the mobile software.   Newly appointed Apple CEO Tim Cook will unwrap the new iPhone at corporate headquarters, running the first major product launch in years without Chairman Steve Jobs. Apple stock was up 1.7 percent just ahead of the event.   The iPhone 5, which is expected to be faster, thinner and have a larger screen, arrives just in time for the crucial holiday shopping season.   It is expected to be loaded with the updated iOS5 software that Apple unveiled in June. Some of the new features include improved notification functions and better Twitter integration.   “We expect improved processing power and camera capabilities, with a potential bump in RAM, though that may not be needed with iCloud,” said William Power, analyst with Baird Equity Research.   “Various sources have suggested that Apple will debut more robust voice control functionality,” he added.   Apple faces the challenge of sustaining the popularity of its current iPhone 4, more than a year old. Apple sold more than 20 million units in the third quarter ended June 25.   Nielsen data shows the iPhone was No. 2 in the United States with a 28 percent market share — slightly more than half Android’s 43 percent.   Globally, according to IHS iSuppli, iPhone shipments climbed 9.1 percent in the second quarter while Nokia’s plummeted more than 30 percent, handing the top spot to Apple with a market share of 18.4 percent.   But Samsung, whose shipments grew even faster, is coming on strong with a global market share of 17.8 percent.   Some on Wall Street also expect Apple to unveil a cheaper phone for the fast-growing Asian market, one of the areas where Apple can accelerate its growth.   Others expect a cameo appearance by Jobs, though a no-show would not be a major disappointment.

The greatly expanded range of TV content on the gaming device effectively makes the Xbox a cable TV set-top box, but stops short of speculation that Microsoft would encourage Xbox owners to drop their pay-TV subscriptions.  Several major technology companies including Microsoft, Google (GOOG.O) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O), have been in long negotiations with the programmers and Hollywood to see if they can provide so-called ‘over-the-top’ online video services which could rival traditional cable television. The programmers have so far successfully resisted any attempt to unravel the $100 billion a year relationship between programmers and pay-TV distributors.  The new Xbox deals announced on Wednesday are part of the technology giant’s bid to make its gaming console a major media hub in the living room and took years to sort out, said Ross Honey, general manager of content acquisition for the interactive entertainment business at Microsoft.  In the U.S., services from Time Warner (TWX.N)-owned HBO, Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Verizon Communications’ (VZ.N) FiOs will be available on the Xbox while other large deals in other countries include Televisa in Mexico and the BBC in the UK.

Sony Corp’s (6758.T) PlayStation, the rival gaming console to the Xbox, started offering live feeds of DirecTV’s DTV.O NFL’s Sunday Ticket this year for the first time. Online services such as Netflix (NFLX.O) have been on both services for years.   He said that while the company is committed to video games, the amount of time Xbox users spent watching video grew by three times this year.   Microsoft shares rose 2.7 percent on Wednesday to $26.03.  ",10052011,http://www.reuters.com/article/microsoft/update-1-microsoft-reaches-40-content-deals-for-xbox-idUSN1E7941GX20111005
234,VZ,Japan's KDDI to sell new iPhone: Apple,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s second-largest mobile carrier KDDI will sell Apple’s new iPhone, the California-based company said, ending rival operator Softbank’s highly profitable reign as the sole provider in Japan.  Shares of Softbank fell 2.3 percent in morning trade, while KDDI fell 0.5 percent and market leader NTT Docomo slid 1.4 percent. That compared with a 0.8 percent fall in the benchmark Nikkei average.  The market response may have been muted by the fact that the reception for the iPhone 4S, unveiled on Tuesday in California, was lukewarm compared with the rapturous welcome sparked by previous models.  Softbank will put the iPhone 4S on sale on October 14, while KDDI said it has not yet decided when it will begin to offer the latest version of the hugely popular smartphone.  “Having KDDI sell the iPhone may liven up the whole smartphone market,” said analyst Shinji Moriyuki of SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo. “I think more people will switch from feature phones.”  The move, reported earlier by Japanese media, comes after Apple opted for similar strategies in other markets, with Sprint becoming the third operator to offer the iPhone in the United States, after AT&T and Verizon.  Analysts say the loss of de facto exclusivity will be a blow for Softbank, Japan’s third-largest mobile carrier, which saw profits balloon after it threw its weight behind the iPhone even as other carriers expressed skepticism that it would take off in a market dominated by feature phones from domestic makers.  Softbank has long been criticized by users for its patchy network quality, and risks losing iPhone fans to its rival.  “To lose that effective exclusivity does give them a little bit more head wind. They will have to work harder,” said Nathan Ramler, an analyst for Macquarie Capital Securities.  It may be only a matter of time before Docomo, with half of Japan’s 120 million mobile phone users, also takes a bite of Apple’s newest offering, possibly spurring an increase in total iPhone sales in Japan.  The trend everywhere is for the iPhone to be offered by multiple cell service providers, which would suggest that Apple may extend itself further, said Macquarie’s Ramler.  “I expect over time to see a similar trend in Japan,” he said.

236,VZ,U.S. FCC draws tough court for Web rule lawsuits," * Court consolidates challenges to D.C. appeals court   * D.C. circuit seen toughest for FCC   By Jasmin Melvin   WASHINGTON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Challenges to new U.S. Internet traffic rules will be heard in the federal appeals court in Washington D.C., a court that has previously been skeptical of the Federal Communications Commission’s authority.   A judicial panel that manages multidistrict litigation   said on Thursday it had randomly selected the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to hear appeals of the FCC’s “Open Internet” order.   The same appeals court ruled last year that the FCC lacked the authority to stop Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) from blocking bandwidth-hogging applications on its broadband network, spurring the agency’s rulemaking.   “The FCC is in for a rough legal battle given the past history of net neutrality in the D.C. circuit,” said Medley Global Advisors analyst Jeffrey Silva.   The FCC has repeatedly expressed confidence in the legal foundation backing the rules which are due to take effect Nov. 20. “The FCC stands ready to defend its open Internet order in any court of appeals,” an agency spokesman said on Thursday.   Adopted by a divided FCC last December, the Internet rules seek to balance the interests of consumers and content providers with those who sell access to the Web and often supply their own content.   The rules forbid broadband providers from blocking legal content while leaving flexibility for providers to manage their networks.   Backers of net neutrality rules say big providers could otherwise use their gatekeeper role to discriminate against competitors. Internet providers say they need to be able to manage their networks for all users.   Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) filed suit last week, asking the D.C. appeals court to have the rules thrown out, saying the FCC was “arbitrary” and “capricious” and acted beyond its statutory authority in imposing the rules. [ID:nS1E78T1P1]   Public interest groups have criticized the rules as too weak, saying the FCC was swayed by big industry players including AT&T Inc (T.N) and Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O).   Free Press filed suit last week in the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston, challenging provisions in the order that give wireless broadband providers more discretion in managing their networks. [ID:nS1E78R1KX]   Other suits were also filed in the second, third, fourth and ninth circuits.

237,VZ,Instant view: Jobs growth better than expected in September,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jobs growth was stronger than expected in September thanks to private-sector growth, easing fears the economy is slipping back into recession, but the unemployment rate was unchanged. * Nonfarm payrolls rose 103,000 the Labor Department said on Friday, while the unemployment rate held steady at 9.1 percent as an increase in household employment offset a rise in the participation rate. * Part of September’s relative strength reflected the return of 45,000 Verizon Communications workers who had dropped off payrolls in August due to a strike. Excluding those workers, payrolls increased by 58,000. * The tenor of the report was strengthened by revisions that showed 99,000 more jobs added in July and August than initially reported. In addition, hourly earnings rebounded and the average work week rose. ELLEN ZENTNER, SENIOR U.S. ECONOMIST AT NOMURA SECURITIES, NEW YORK: “The upward revision to August and July is great — 99,000, we’ll take it. “You still got a pretty weak trend for payroll growth, 58,000 in September if you take out those (striking) Verizon workers. But that being said, the upward revisions to the prior two months puts at a three-month moving average of 96,000. “Without those upward revisions, we had been expecting a three-month moving average of closer to 40,000. This shows that of the many factors that broadsided the economy in August, we were able to hang on in August and further create more jobs in September. “We’re still not at any kind of job level that could bring the unemployment level down, that still remains a big concern for the economy. “But nevertheless the stronger than expected rise in non-farm payrolls today helps provide a little bit of relief to the markets that the U.S. economy is still hanging onto to recovery.” ROBERT LUTTS, PRESIDENT, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT CABOT MONEY MANAGEMENT: “Clearly a more positive number than last month and the revision for August was favorable. It basically means the U.S. economy rather than entering a double dip is in neutral. “The markets will sigh a little bit of relief as this is bolstering the case we are not entering a double dip but sort of muddling through. “We have been seeing many companies announcing cutbacks, governments are cutting back so we could see a couple more months of challenging employment data.” JACK ABLIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, AT HARRIS PRIVATE BANK IN CHICAGO: “This is critical, this is the most important data that we have seen this cycle... This is going to get people’s attention.” “This confirms that most of the negativity we have seen in the market is derived from the market itself and not the data,” he said.” JOHN DOYLE, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, TEMPUS CONSULTING, WASHINGTON “The way the market’s been recently, we’ll take any bit of good news. This removes some of the concern that the labor market is getting worse. Stock futures shot up and the dollar fell — a pure risk-on reaction. If the euro runs beyond $1.3550, it could be a really tough day for the dollar. The revisions from last month were positive and give people a slightly brighter view of the landscape. But overall, this still isn’t that many jobs, so while it’s better than it could be, it’s not great.” BRIAN DOLAN, CHIEF STRATEGIST, FOREX.COM, BEDMINSTER, NEW JERSEY: “It’s a breath of fresh air and should allow the risk recovery we’ve had this week to continue. It’s still just one month’s worth of data and the drop in the ISM employment index bodes ill for the coming months. This number is likely distorted, too, by the return of the Verizon strikers. But even so, revisions to the prior month were positive and the household survey showed a larger increase as well. “All in all, it suggests a continuation of the risk recovery and that the U.S. will outperform other developed economies. That means the dollar should weaken and the yen crosses should move higher as people take on more risk.” “They look awfully good relative to last month. It is very hard to tell what it means because you average the two months and you are still looking at 50,000 each, but certainly it is very promising. Hopefully it is sustainable and continues so that we can avoid recession. If we keep up like this we will certainly avoid that.” VIMOMBI NSHOM, ECONOMIST, IFR ECONOMICS, A UNIT OF THOMSON REUTERS: “Although positive and above consensus (60k), the growth was not enough to reduce the unemployment rate, which is still at 9.1%. The market had expected a smaller count based on some ‘corrective’ movement in both the private and public sector, which had depressed August’s nonexistent payroll growth (which is now reported as having added 57k jobs). In addition to August’s revision, July payrolls at 127k (originally 85k) expands the job market by 99k than originally thought. Today’s report amounts to 287k jobs created in Q3. The expected suppressive and supportive influences to detract and add to jobs creation did materialize in September — those being a decline in government payrolls and a extra boost from the information sector.” STOCKS: U.S. stock index futures turned positive BONDS: U.S. bond prices extended losses FOREX: The dollar rose against the yen and fell vs the euro",10072011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-instantjobs/instant-view-jobs-growth-better-than-expected-in-september-idUSTRE7962HF20111007
238,VZ,Anti-Wall St. protesters march with Verizon workers,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Anti-Wall Street protesters joined Verizon Communications workers on Friday in a march to denounce corporate greed as the company and 45,000 employees negotiate a new labor contract. The march by about 500 people to a Verizon store in Lower Manhattan coincided with the top U.S. mobile provider reporting a third-quarter profit of $1.38 billion, more than double its profit for the same quarter last year. Support from unions across the United States has helped boost the ranks of the Occupy Wall Street movement against economic inequality, which began five weeks ago and sparked protests nationwide and globally. “We’re all in this together,” Verizon worker Steven Jackman, 53, from Long Island, said of joining forces with Occupy Wall Street. The unionized workers negotiating a new contract, who went on strike for two weeks in August, represent roughly half Verizon’s wireline workforce. “Until we get money out of politics, nothing will change,” said Occupy Wall Street protester Richard Fisher, 55, who joined the Verizon march. “I haven’t had a job since 2008. My unemployment ran out. There are no jobs.” But some people are asking what will happen next with the Occupy Wall Street movement, which critics say does not have a clear message. The protesters say they are upset that the billions of dollars in bank bailouts during the recession allowed banks to resume earning huge profits while average Americans have had no relief from high unemployment and job insecurity. They also believe the richest 1 percent of Americans do not pay their fair share in taxes. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said on Friday that Occupy Wall Street’s camp headquarters — set up in a privately owned, publicly accessible park in the city’s financial district on September 17 — had become a “tourist attraction.” Bloomberg told a local radio show there was little the city could do about the protesters until the park owners, Brookfield Office Properties, made an official complaint. Bloomberg said authorities would start enforcing a rule requiring protesters to have a city permit for any marches. “There are businesses and people going to work and going to school. There’s (protesters) drumming in the middle of the night. There’s people just using the streets as bathrooms,” Bloomberg said. Last week, a showdown between protesters and New York police was averted when Brookfield postponed a cleanup, which demonstrators feared was a bid to remove them. The protests have been driven by social media, culminating in global rallies last weekend, which were mostly peaceful apart from Rome, where there were riots. Earlier on Friday, Occupy Wall Street protesters were among a couple hundred people who rallied in Harlem against the New York Police Department’s “stop and frisk” policy, which critics say targets black and Latino New Yorkers. About 30 protesters were arrested for disorderly conduct, police said. In Cincinnati, police cleared a downtown park on Friday where protesters had been camping, arresting 23 people, while six protesters were arrested in Tampa, Florida.

239,VZ,"Verizon subscribers miss Street, investors shrug","(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc wireless subscriber growth was slower than expected in the quarter before the latest Apple Inc iPhone launch, but was still ahead of its biggest rival. Verizon Wireless, its mobile venture with Vodafone Group Plc, added 882,000 subscribers in the quarter compared with the average analyst expectation for 1.04 million from eight analysts contacted by Reuters. But its shares barely moved after the news. Stifel Nicolaus analyst Chris King said the results looked strong considering that the No. 1 U.S. mobile provider’s biggest rival AT&T; Inc announced less than half as many new subscribers in its quarterly report the day before. “It’s difficult to complain about (subscribers),” he said. “It’s going to be so much better than everybody else’s. They’re still continuing to take market share.” Analysts also noted that Verizon Wireless handily beat their wireless profit margin estimates — a record 47.8 percent margin based on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization as a percentage of service revenue. This was partly because lower smartphone sales helped reduce its costs for the quarter as Verizon and its rivals all pay subsidies to force smartphone buyers to commit to two-year service contracts. King said that a financial report that was otherwise roughly in line with expectations was not enough to impress investors in Verizon, whose shares trade at a big premium to AT&T;’s. Its share price is roughly 14 times analyst estimates for its 2012 earnings per share compared with AT&T;’s multiple of 11.5. “They would have had to knock the cover of the ball to have their shares go up (materially),” King said. Verizon’s Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo told analysts on a conference call that Verizon Wireless sold 2 million iPhones in the third quarter but that only 20 percent of its iPhone customers were new to Verizon Wireless. Verizon said it has a backlog of strong demand for the iPhone 4S, the newest model. But unlike AT&T;, it did not provide sales numbers. Shammo said more half its smartphone customers bought phones based on Google Inc’s Android software in the quarter. Verizon’s profit rose to $1.38 billion, or 49 cents per share, from $659 million, or 23 cents per share, in the year-earlier quarter, the company said on Friday. Excluding items, Verizon earned 56 cents per share, which compared with Wall Street expectations for 55 cents. Revenue rose to $27.9 billion from $26.5 billion and was slightly ahead of analyst estimates of $27.88 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company also repeated its previous expectation for 2011 earnings per share growth of 5 percent to 8 percent from $2.08 in 2010 and revenue growth of 4 percent to 8 percent. Chief Executive Lowell McAdam noted that the company kept its targets despite storm-related network problems in August that followed a two-week labor strike. “We faced significant challenges in recent months, yet delivered results that keep us on track to meet our 2011 earnings and revenue guidance, with great momentum expected entering 2012,” he said in a statement. Because of the storm and the strike, Verizon’s 131,000 net new FiOS TV customers and its 138,000 FiOS Internet additions, lagged well behind its second quarter FiOS additions of more than 180,000 for each service. However, it promised analysts on a conference call that it would add more than 200,000 customers to each service in the current quarter as it has reduced its order backlog. The company noted that the storm and the strike also hurt the pace at which it could install business services but it said it still “gained some traction in the quarter beside the additional strain of macro-economic challenges.” Verizon shares were down 2 cents at $37.08 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

244,VZ,US union accuses Verizon of corporate tax dodging,"* Communication Workers in labor dispute with Verizon * CWA report “inaccurate, politically motivated”-Verizon * Rockefeller to revive “Reverse Morris Trust” legislation By Patrick Temple-West WASHINGTON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc came under attack over its tax record on Tuesday from a union representing Verizon workers seeking a new labor agreement and from an advocacy group that studies corporate tax dodging. The Communications Workers of America union issued a report accusing Verizon of paying no current federal income taxes in the past two years and of dodging state taxes, while also criticizing large pay packages for senior Verizon executives. The report said that, though Verizon has broken no laws, its efforts to avoid taxes underscores a broader problem of U.S. corporations not shouldering their fair share of taxes. The CWA is locked in negotiations with Verizon for a new labor contract after thousands of CWA workers went on strike against Verizon for two weeks in August after their contract expired. A Verizon spokesman said the CWA report, compiled with the assistance of Washington, D.C., tax advocacy group Citizens for Tax Justice, was “a rehash of the same inaccurate and politically motivated statements these union-orchestrated front groups have been making for several years.” Verizon was one of 30 Fortune 500 corporations identified on Nov. 3 by Citizens for Tax Justice as having paid no corporate income taxes in 2008 through 2010 — a newsworthy accusation at a time of tight U.S. fiscal constraints. Links to Nov. 3 stories: Other companies cited in the group’s Nov. 3 report included Pepco Holdings Inc and General Electric Co. CWA President Larry Cohen is on the board of Citizens for Tax Justice. The CWA’s attack on Verizon is “painful and embarrassing” for the company, which is not doing anything illegal or different from many other companies, said Jeff Kagan, a technology industry analyst, in a statement on Tuesday. “We should redesign the tax code. This is not just a Verizon issue. This is a tax problem,” he said. Verizon spokesman Robert Varettoni said the company has a significant deferred tax liability because of its $16.5 billion annual capital investment. After any refunds Verizon received, Varettoni said, the company paid income taxes of $430 million in 2010, $158 million in 2009 and $1.206 billion in 2008 to federal and state tax authorities. The federal tax bill for 2010 was $2.2 billion, with $2.9 billion deferred for payment in later years, he said. The report by Citizens for Tax Justice comes amid an intensifying debate in the U.S. Congress about tax reform as part of the solution to reducing the huge federal deficit. The Obama administration and Democrats have targeted corporate tax breaks for possible closure as a way of raising new revenue. Republicans have resisted such proposals but in recent days have signaled some new flexibility. “Verizon Communications is a large and prosperous company that should pay a substantial amount in taxes,” said the CWA-Citizens for Tax Justice report. Verizon benefited from a tax loophole known as a “Reverse Morris Trust,” the report said. This break allows companies to record a sale of assets as a spin-off for tax purposes. Verizon employed this strategy with two sales in 2008 and 2010 to avoid paying more than $1.5 billion in federal, state and local taxes, it said. “The companies are using this really complicated transaction to sell some assets,” said Rebecca Wilkins, senior counsel at Citizens for Tax Justice. The only reason they are structured that way is to avoid the taxes,” she said. The House of Representatives in March 2010 approved legislation that would have killed it, but the bill was not considered in the Senate. Democratic Senator Jay Rockefeller introduced similar legislation in May 2010 to end the loophole. He is preparing to reintroduce the legislation “in the near future,” said Abbie McDonough, a spokesperson for Rockefeller, on Tuesday.",11152011,http://www.reuters.com/article/orlofsky-usa-tax-verizon/us-union-accuses-verizon-of-corporate-tax-dodging-idUSN1E7AD1AG20111115
245,VZ,Verizon and Vodafone say getting on better,"BARCELONA, Spain, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Tension between Vodafone and Verizon Communications over their joint venture in the United States has eased and the success of new partnerships could determine if that relationship goes any further. Speaking at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecoms conference in Barcelona, both the head of Vodafone and the finance officer of Verizon said relations had improved hugely in recent years through the Verizon Wireless business. That is likely to be seized on by some investors and analysts who have speculated that the two sides could eventually merge if they can get past the sometimes difficult environment sparked by the joint venture which is 45 percent owned by the British firm and the rest by Verizon. The main cause of concern had been Verizon’s decision to suspend the dividend from 2005 to focus on paying down debt, a move that some analysts had interpreted as designed to pressurise Vodafone out of the company. Verizon finally backed down in July and announced that the joint venture, the largest operator in the United States, would pay a $10 billion dividend to the owners. “This is going absolutely in the right direction,” Verizon’s Chief Finance Officer Francis Shammo said on Thursday. “We’ve always said it was a financial relationship and now (Verizon CEO) Lowell (McAdam) and (Vodafone CEO) Vittorio (Colao) are moving this into a strategic relationship.” The two sides have formed new partnerships to work together on purchasing, building networks, product lines and working more closely to service corporate customers through their wireless unit. And Vodafone Chief Executive Colao said the success of the closer ties could help to determine what happens next between the two telecom giants. “Personally I’m excited that we are doing the right thing,” he said. “How deep this becomes will determine what eventually will be the final state (between us). “We may decide that this is the perfect state... if we don’t see anything further we’ll say fine, we’ll stay here and be good partners, we help them in allowing them make investments, they give us dividends, we cooperate together.” “If the world changes completely we’ll sit down and discuss another outcome.” However an element of friction clearly still exists between the two sides over future dividend payments and whether the $10 billion payout will become a permanent feature. “There are other things that have to be considered here,” Verizon’s Shammo said when asked about an annual dividend. “Verizon Wireless still has $12 billion of gross debt on its book and I’ve been very open and said they have to pay that debt down.” “I don’t want debt on Verizon Wireless’ books, it’s not a good cost structure for us. They have to pay down their debt, we’re going to need more spectrum in 2015 and if an opportunity comes up we’ll certainly acquire that spectrum, so there’s a lot of dynamics here and it’s too premature to set anything.” Colao, when asked about an annual dividend, chose instead to refer to the $3 billion of net debt on the books rather than the gross debt. “The current situation is 3 billion of net debt, come next year it will be whatever plus 8 or 9 billion of cash... and then we’ll see what is left,” he said. “I suppose the Verizon shareholders also want a dividend, right?” he asked with a smile, in reference to some analyst comments in the past that Verizon Communications will need a dividend from the Wireless unit to help pay its own group dividend. Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Larsen said the first Verizon Wireless dividend could actually be enough to support Verizon Communications for two years unless it has big pension contributions it needs to pay next year.

246,VZ,Comcast to start selling Verizon mobile early 2012,"NEW YORK - NEW YORK (Reuters) - Comcast Corp, the largest U.S. cable operator, will start selling Verizon Wireless products in four markets early next year, its top cable executive said on Monday. Comcast, Time Warner Cable Inc and Bright House Networks last week said they had reached a deal to sell wireless spectrum to Verizon Wireless for $3.6 billion in a transaction that will also see Verizon sell cable products and the cable companies bundle Verizon wireless products. Neil Smit, president of Comcast Cable, said his company will continue to compete with Verizon Wireless’ parent Verizon Communications Inc in markets where it offers its FiOS TV and Internet service. Time Warner Cable, too, plans to start selling existing Verizon products in bundled packages almost immediately, said Chief Financial Officer Irene Esteves, who, like Smit, was speaking at a UBS investor conference. But Time Warner Cable’s Esteves said it was too soon predict what specific new products it could bring to market with Verizon, or when those products could be available. Cable companies have previously partnered with wireless companies Sprint Nextel and Clearwire Corp. Smit said Comcast would begin to wind down its customer relationships with those companies but it would retain its 9 percent equity stake in Clearwire “for the foreseeable future”. Verizon Wireless is co-owned by Verizon and Vodafone. ",12052011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-comcast-verizon/comcast-to-start-selling-verizon-mobile-early-2012-idUSTRE7B41EU20111205
247,VZ,Exclusive: Verizon to take on Netflix with Web service,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc plans to launch a standalone service allowing customers to stream movies and television shows over the Web, in a fresh challenge to Netflix Inc and the traditional cable TV business, according to several people briefed on the plan. The phone company is talking with prospective programming partners about the service, which would be introduced outside of markets where it currently offers its broadband and TV package, known as FiOS, these people said. That would make it available to some 85 million U.S. households. The new service could be rolled out in 2012, according to one of the people. Shares in Netflix fell by as much as 5 percent on Tuesday to the day’s low before recovering to end the day down 3 percent at $68.14 on the Nasdaq. The package of programming would be limited in its scope, said two people with knowledge of the plans. Another person said the focus would be packages of movies similar to Liberty Media’s Starz Play and Viacom’s Epix or could involve children’s programming from a partner such as Walt Disney Co or Viacom. Epix’s current exclusive online-streaming contract with Netflix runs out next September, allowing other services to negotiate with Viacom for Epix’ package of movies from Paramount, Lions Gate and MGM studios. Viacom Chief Executive Phillipe Dauman said at a conference this week his company would be open to negotiating with other broadband only services. People familiar with the plans declined to be identified as the discussions between Verizon and programming partners are confidential and sensitive. Verizon has been back and forth with programmers over the last two years exploring the possibility. While a lot of the discussion has been around fees, the programmers have also been concerned about the possibility of hurting their existing - and lucrative - relationships with the cable operators. Crucially, any new Web TV service would be offered outside of Verizon’s FiOS current markets. Verizon currently has 5 million FiOS TV subscribers. A Verizon spokesman declined to comment. News of the service will have added controversy in the wake of sister company Verizon Wireless’s plans to resell cable TV service for Comcast Corp, Time Warner Cable Inc and Bright House Networks. Under that deal, announced last week, Verizon Wireless will pay $3.6 billion for valuable spectrum from the cable companies. Verizon Wireless is a joint venture of Verizon and Vodafone Group. While a limited package of TV shows and movies is unlikely to have an immediate impact on cable sales, the launch of an online video service by a major company like Verizon will only add to the uneasiness in the pay TV business. Companies that sell cable and satellite subscriptions are concerned that customers will drop their pay-TV subscriptions in favor of cheaper Web alternatives - so called ‘cord-cutting’ or ‘over-the-top’. Most likely, Verizon would want to price any such service competitively with Netflix, whose subscriber count has swelled to some 23 million. In the last few years, traditional cable operators have been steadily losing video customers to satellite and phone companies who have replicated the cable model. But the biggest fear is that new Web rivals including Netflix, Amazon.com Inc and Google Inc will disrupt the $100 billion a year cable business. Microsoft Corp had looked closely at launching a similar disruptive service through its Xbox gaming device but has so far decided to work with the cable industry in offering an enhanced service to paying cable and satellite subscribers. “If this deal comes true it’s not clear to me what Verizon would bring to the table that is materially different to what others like Amazon offer,” said Carlos Kirjner, analyst at Bernstein Research. Kirjner said Verizon would struggle to negotiate favorable terms to be competitive with Netflix. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, speaking about rivals at a UBS Media and Technology investment conference on Tuesday, said “the competitor we fear most is HBO Go,” a streaming service for subscribers of the pay TV channel owned by Time Warner Inc. “HBO and Netflix both spend between $1 billion and $2 billion a year on content. If you want to compete with HBO and Netflix, you better commit to multiple-year spending between one and two billion,” Hastings said. “At this point, none of these guys have chosen to do that,” Hastings said. He was not asked specifically about the planned Verizon service. One reason Verizon is keen on launching online services is to be able to grow its customer base and thereby lower its programming costs on a per-subscriber basis. The more subscribers a distributor has, the easier it is to negotiate lower fees. Programmers and distributors have been working closely together for the last year on making cable networks available on the Web to paying subscribers in an initiative called TV Everywhere. Verizon FiOS customers currently have access to around 30 networks over the Web through FiOS TV Online.

249,VZ,Cablevision sues Verizon over Internet speed claims,"* Cablevision calls Verizon ad campaign deceptive By Terry Baynes NEW YORK, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Cablevision Systems Corp sued Verizon Communications Inc on Tuesday for allegedly misleading consumers about the speed of Cablevision’s Internet services. In the lawsuit filed in Brooklyn federal court, Cablevision accused Verizon of running a deceptive advertising campaign that misrepresents the current performance of Cablevision’s high-speed Internet. Verizon’s advertisements claimed a new study from the Federal Communications Commission showed Cablevision delivers up to only 59 percent of its advertised Internet speeds during peak hours, the complaint said. The suit accused Verizon of relying on the speed test results from an obsolete August 2011 report that the FCC has since updated. Cablevision said more recent FCC tests in September and October show Cablevision delivers Internet speeds “very close to, and often above” what it advertises. Verizon said its ads are based on the FCC’s months-long study of Internet speeds, released in August. “In terms of the accuracy of its advertising, Cablevision was the worst,” Verizon spokesman William Kula said in an email, adding that the company would vigorously defend the lawsuit. Cablevision is seeking a court order blocking the ads as well as monetary damages to be determined at trial. The case is Cablevision Systems Corp et al v.

253,VZ,Verizon ditches $2 fee after customer uproar,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Wireless has reversed its decision to charge a $2 fee for telephone and online bill payments, bowing to a storm of criticism from consumers and the U.S. communications regulator. The biggest U.S. wireless operator retracted its decision on Friday, just a day after it announced the fee for one-time payments, which was to have begun January 15. The consumer victory comes after Bank of America recently decided against a new $5 monthly fee for debit card users after consumers and lawmakers protested the charge. “There is power in numbers and in the end, the customer is always right,” one person said on the Verizon Wireless online forum. “How can any corporation expect to keep business by doing that? It’s pure greed just like with Bank of America.” Verizon said it listened to its customers and made the decision based on customer input after many complained and some threatened to leave the service if the fee was instituted. A spokesman said that the company had just wanted to encourage consumers to pay their bills via different methods such as autopay, where they give Verizon permission to charge their credit card or bank account automatically each month. Verizon Wireless is a venture of Verizon Communications Inc and Vodafone Group Plc. The quick turn-around came after little more than a day of complaints, but not before the U.S. Federal Communications Commission said it was “concerned” about the fee and that it was looking into it. “On behalf of American consumers, we’re concerned about Verizon’s actions and are looking into the matter,” an official for the FCC said earlier on Friday. The prospect of a $2 fee created a flurry of online activity and one consumer organization, Change.org, said 95,000 people joined a campaign on its website urging Verizon to drop the fee. “The era of corporations walking roughshod over consumers without consequence is officially over,” Ben Rattray, chief executive of Change.org, said in a statement. Verizon Wireless customers told the company, often in colorful language, that they would not put up with the fee. “If this fee goes through, I will be taking my business elsewhere!!!” one person said on the Verizon Wireless website. Another said “Victory is ours!” after the about-face. The turnaround comes after another high-profile reversal of course earlier this year by video rental service Netflix Inc in the face of customer disgust. In October it canceled plans to split its DVD rental service from its online streaming service. The move would have forced customers of both streaming and DVD options to visit different websites and maintain different accounts for each subscription. The Verizon Wireless incident served to highlight fee practices elsewhere in the communications industry. Rivals AT&T; Inc and Sprint Nextel said on Friday that they charge some customers $5 for bill payments, revising their comments from the day before. AT&T; and Comcast Corp say that they charge some customers who look for personal assistance in paying their bills but that they do not charge for online payments. Sprint said it charges customers with bad credit if they refuse to enroll for auto pay. The Sprint and AT&T; fees are even higher than Verizon’s proposed levy at $5 per transaction.

256,VZ,"Verizon FiOS: to beat 'em, first join 'em","LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc is pushing hard to move its “FiOS” TV service beyond the set-top box and onto the latest gadgets - from TVs and tablets to gaming consoles - to fend off competition from online video services such as Netflix Inc, Amazon Inc and Apple’s Inc iTunes. Verizon plans to extend its service to “dozens and dozens” of devices in connections that let users stream Web video alongside FiOS content.the next 12 to 24 months, Joe Ambeault, director of product management for FiOS TV, told Reuters in an intereview at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The company announced deals this week to get its service onto “smart” TVs from LG Electronics and Samsung Electronics Co. Unlike traditional televisions, these sets - which Verizon is testing - have Internet Verizon, which had already forged a FiOS deal with Microsoft Corp for its Xbox gaming console, is also negotiating with content providers to allow consumers to access its TV service on devices such as tablets outside the home. Such partnerships could encourage cost-conscious consumers to end their FiOS TV subscriptions, but Ambeault noted he had no choice, but to compete with Web-based services. “I’ve a whole new set of competitors,” Ambeault said, adding that his embrace of these devices is proactive. “It’s too late after people are already fleeing.” Another big source of competition could be iTunes. Apple is widely expected to launch a living-room television as soon as this year. Ambeault does not know if or when that might happen, but if it does, he hopes to make sure FiOS content is available on such a product. “We would love to integrate our content onto the Apple TV,” he said. “My alternative is to do nothing and ignore the device, and you go there anyway as a consumer ... or be on that device and have a fighting chance and keep your business.” Ambeault also noted that, if FiOS is associated with innovative hardware, it can help keep consumers interested. He cited a feature on the upcoming LG TV, which allows the user to control the TV by waving a “magic wand” remote control instead of using traditional controls. To help ensure FiOS is the service consumers associate with such innovation, Ambeault is planning joint advertising with LG, similar to the way Verizon Wireless features its latest phones in advertisements for its wireless service. “If I’m there first, I’ve a higher likelihood of winning. If I’m not on that device, I’m out of here,” he added. ",1122012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ces-verizon/verizon-fios-to-beat-em-first-join-em-idUSTRE80B29O20120112
257,VZ,"Verizon, Redbox plan Netflix challenge","(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc and Coinstar’s Redbox unit have formed a joint venture to sell video services aimed at competing against video rental giant Netflix Inc. The venture will combine the Redbox DVD rental kiosk business with an Internet video offering from Verizon, including mobile offerings, in the second half of the year. On Monday, Redbox-operator Coinstar Inc moved to cement its hold on its business of renting DVDs from automated kiosks, announcing it will buy rival NCR Corp’s machines and video inventory for up to $100 million. That, and better-than-expected quarterly results, pushed the stock 13 percent higher after hours. However, investors in Verizon and Coinstar were unimpressed as the pair offered little detail about the service. Netflix shares ended up 2.2 percent, reversing a decline that came directly after the news. The new service’s price will start from around $6 a month for movie streaming and one DVD rental at a time from the Redbox kiosks, according to a person familiar with the plan. Netflix’s pricing currently starts at $7.99 for either streaming only or a single DVD by mail. To get both the streaming and DVD rental package prices start at $15.98. Verizon and Redbox declined to comment on the pricing. The alliance will mark Verizon’s first foray into video streaming outside its network operating region as the telephone company so far only offers Web video services to subscribers using its FiOS TV service which competes with cable providers like Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable. However, Verizon/Redbox’s success in competing with Netflix and other online rivals like Amazon.com and Hulu Plus, will depend hugely on the price of the service and the depth of content it has available, according to analysts. “We’re in negotiations right now (and) finalizing,” Bob Mudge, Verizon’s head of FiOS, told Reuters. “I feel very confident we’ll have a wide set of digital distribution content.” The executive promised a subscription service and “other options” with the “right pricing” to compete but declined to give details of the service or to comment on how much it would cost Verizon, which has already spend about $23 billion upgrading its copper network for its FiOS TV and Web service. Verizon and Coinstar will need to invest heavily to convince Hollywood studios to participate to create a service comparable to Netflix, said Hudson Square Research analyst Daniel Ernst. “The question is, how much are they investing to get a large library of programming? Netflix is spending up to $1 billion a year on content,” said Ernst. “For me, it’s doubtful that these two companies will invest to that level.” According to regulatory filings Redbox will make an initial capital contribution of $14 million in cash, implying that Verizon would contribute around $26 million. As Netflix has shifted its emphasis to instant-view streaming from its mailed DVD rental service, it has had to write ever-heftier checks to content. Coinstar earnings got a lift from the negotiation of better credit-card rates. A strong movie slate also helped it post fourth-quarter revenue of $520.5 million, surpassing the $498 million Wall Street had expected. Verizon did not disclose how many of its FiOS TV programming partners, if any, had agreed to make video content available for the streaming service. The partnership follows a December 6 Reuters report that Verizon was planning a streaming video service. To help market the online service inside and outside the FiOS region, Mudge said he is hoping to tap into the loyalty of Coinstar’s 30 million customers who rent an average of about 1.9 million movies a day at Coinstar’s 35,000 kiosks in places like supermarkets and gas stations. Netflix had 24.4 million U.S. subscribers at the end of December, while Verizon ended the year with 4.2 million FiOS TV customers. Coinstar rents out DVDs at $1.20 a day and Blu-Ray discs for $1.50 a day. Coinstar sees an online offering as an important expansion beyond the roughly 200 recent-release movies the company offers at any given time, CEO Paul Davis said. “What our consumers would like is access to a much broader array of options,” Davis told Reuters, adding that most CoinStar customers have Internet connections. “We’re focused on new releases. ... Once it’s in the box a few months we pull it out.” The venture — to be 65 percent owned by Verizon and 35 percent by Redbox — will offer its first products in the second half of 2012, the companies said. It will be managed by a board consisting of three Verizon appointed managers and two appointed by Redbox. Pacific Crest analyst Steve Clement said it was too soon to judge whether the venture will be a success. “We don’t know what kind of content they’ll have available, what they’ll pay for that content and what they’ll charge for it,” said Clement. “There’s way more questions than answers at this point.” He noted that a big part of Netflix’s success was due to its easy user interface and recommendation of TV shows and movies based on its subscribers viewing history. Shares of Netflix closed up 2.2 percent at $129.25 on Nasdaq. Coinstar ended up 1.8 percent at $50.56 after pulling back from an earlier increase of about 7 percent. Verizon edged up 0.8 percent to $38.14 on the New York Stock Exchange. ",2062012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-verizon-redbox/verizon-redbox-plan-netflix-challenge-idUSTRE81510M20120206

259,VZ,"Coinstar jumps on Verizon JV, buy of NCR's DVD assets","(Reuters) - Shares of Coinstar Inc (CSTR.O) surged 20 percent to their highest in a year, after the Redbox kiosks owner teamed up with Verizon (VZ.N) to sell video services, stepping up its game against video rental giant Netflix (NFLX.O). The stock jumped to $60.84 in heavy early morning trade, making it one of the biggest gainers on the Nasdaq. More than 9 million shares changed hands by 1104 ET, about 6 times their normal volumes. Under the joint venture, Coinstar will provide the digital content, while Verizon will provide streaming and download services, and is expected in the second half of the year. “Redbox (is) now the most popular physical DVD rental company,” Benchmark Co said in a research note. “While Redbox’s share of the joint venture start-up loss is expected to be $19 million this year, we believe this could be a growth vehicle in the future.” On Monday, Coinstar reported a better-than-expected fourth quarter, helped by the negotiation of better credit-card rates, and guided to a strong year ahead. The company also said it would buy rival NCR Corp’s (NCR.N) DVD assets for up to $100 million, sending NCR’s shares up 10 percent to $21 on Tuesday — their highest in nearly three and a half years. “NCR’s Blockbuster Express kiosks had been the only serious competitor to Redbox. If the deal goes through, we believe Redbox should be able to leverage NCR’s 9,000 locations over Coinstar’s existing infrastructure,” Benchmark said.

260,VZ,"UPDATE 8-Verizon, Redbox plan Netflix challenge","* Verizon to own 65 pct, Redbox 35 pct * Redbox to contribute $14 mln, implying $26 mln from Verizon * Venture to undercut Netflix with cheaper DVD rental, streaming * Netflix shares recoup losses * Coinstar jumps 13 pct after deal for rival kiosks, earnings By Sinead Carew and Yinka Adegoke Feb 6 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc  and Coinstar’s Redbox unit have formed a joint venture to sell video services aimed at competing against video rental giant Netflix Inc. The venture will combine the Redbox DVD rental kiosk business with an Internet video offering from Verizon, including mobile offerings, in the second half of the year. However, investors in Verizon and Coinstar were unimpressed as the pair offered little detail about the service. Netflix shares ended up 2.2 percent, reversing a decline that came directly after the news. The new service’s price will start from around $6 a month for movie streaming and one DVD rental at a time from the Redbox kiosks, according to a person familiar with the plan. Netflix’s pricing currently starts at $7.99 for either streaming only or a single DVD by mail. To get both the streaming and DVD rental package prices start at $15.98. Verizon and Redbox declined to comment on the pricing. The alliance will mark Verizon’s first foray into video streaming outside its network operating region as the telephone company so far only offers Web video services to subscribers using its FiOS TV service which competes with cable providers like Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable. However, Verizon/Redbox’s success in competing with Netflix and other online rivals like Amazon.com and Hulu Plus, will depend hugely on the price of the service and the depth of content it has available, according to analysts. “We’re in negotiations right now (and) finalizing,” Bob Mudge, Verizon’s head of FiOS, told Reuters. “I feel very confident we’ll have a wide set of digital distribution content.” The executive promised a subscription service and “other options” with the “right pricing” to compete but declined to give details of the service or to comment on how much it would cost Verizon, which has already spend about $23 billion upgrading its copper network for its FiOS TV and Web service. Verizon and Coinstar will need to invest heavily to convince Hollywood studios to participate to create a service comparable to Netflix, said Hudson Square Research analyst Daniel Ernst. “The question is, how much are they investing to get a large library of programming? Netflix is spending up to $1 billion a year on content,” said Ernst. “For me, it’s doubtful that these two companies will invest to that level.” According to regulatory filings Redbox will make an initial capital contribution of $14 million in cash, implying that Verizon would contribute around $26 million. As Netflix has shifted its emphasis to instant-view streaming from its mailed DVD rental service, it has had to write ever-heftier checks to content. For its part, Coinstar moved to cement its hold on its business of renting DVDs from automated kiosks, announcing on Monday it will buy rival NCR Corp’s machines and video inventory for up to $100 million. That, and better-than-expected quarterly results, pushed the stock 13 percent higher after hours. The deal is “a testament that we believe in the physical space,” Coinstar’s Paul Davis told analysts on a conference call.  The purchase of NCR assets, which is subject to regulatory approval, will help the company fill in areas where it currently does not operate, he said. Coinstar earnings got a lift from the negotiation of better credit-card rates. A strong movie slate also helped it post fourth-quarter revenue of $520.5 million, surpassing the $498 million Wall Street had expected. Verizon did not disclose how many of its FiOS TV programming partners, if any, had agreed to make video content available for the streaming service. The partnership follows a Dec. 6 Reuters report that Verizon was planning a streaming video service. To help market the online service inside and outside the FiOS region, Mudge said he is hoping to tap into the loyalty of Coinstar’s 30 million customers who rent an average of about 1.9 million movies a day at Coinstar’s 35,000 kiosks in places like supermarkets and gas stations.

262,VZ,TEXT-S&P; says Verizon ratings unaffected by financial results,"Feb 29 - Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services said today that its ratings and outlook on Verizon Communications Inc. (A-/Stable/A-2) are not immediately affected by the company’s 2011 audited financial results, which included a $3 billion year-over-year increase in the underfunded pension and OPEB liabilities, adjusted for future tax benefits. The increase mostly reflected a decrease in the discount rate used to calculate the liabilities, a lower return on plan assets than originally estimated, and various plan assumption revisions. Largely as a result of the increase in underfunded postretirement liabilities, our adjusted debt to EBITDA was 3.2x as of the end of 2011, from 2.7x a year earlier, including the present value of operating leases, net pension and OPEB obligations, and excluding 45% of Verizon Wireless’ adjusted debt and EBITDA, reflecting the minority ownership of the joint venture by Vodafone. Adjusted for debt repayments in early 2012 and $3 billion in anticipated pension and OPEB cash contributions by Verizon in 2012, 2011 leverage would have been closer to 3x. While this would still be at the high end of our range for the ‘A-‘ rating, our stable outlook assumes that the company can achieve modest improvement in this metric in 2012 and 2013. In particular, the company’s wireless EBITDA levels and margin were dampened in the fourth quarter of 2011 by its aggressive sales of smartphones, including the iPhone; smartphones represented 70% of total postpaid phone sales in the quarter, and these carry higher costs per gross addition than other devices. As a result, while the company’s EBITDA service margin remains one of the highest in the industry, this metric declined to 42.2% in the fourth quarter of 2011, from 47.8% in the prior quarter and 47.5% a year earlier. The addition of higher average revenue per user (ARPU) smartphone subscribers, while pressuring near-term margins, provides Verizon the ability to increase wireless cash flow over time, which would contribute to modest improvement in the company’s overall leverage. However, if the company does not remain on a trajectory to achieve leverage of below 3x, we would likely revise the outlook to negative or lower the rating.",2292012,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWNA127920120229
263,VZ,Verizon tells Congress cable deals ease spectrum crunch,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Verizon Communications and Comcast executives, in testimony on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, defended joint spectrum and marketing deals as a way for the wireless carrier to handle a coming spectrum crunch. Verizon Wireless, the largest U.S. carrier, announced plans on December 2 to pay Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N $3.6 billion in spectrum and marketing deals. It reached a similar agreement with Cox Communications just days later. The cable operators would resell Verizon’s mobile service as part of the deals. Opponents have focused on Verizon’s already large spectrum holdings and cross-marketing agreements between Verizon and the cable companies, while some consumer advocates have said the companies should compete against each other, not collaborate. The Federal Communications Commission and Justice Department must approve the deals. The Justice Department recently blocked AT&T; Inc’s (T.N) purchase of T-Mobile USA, a deal that AT&T; said it needed to address spectrum shortages. Senator Herb Kohl, chair of the antitrust subcommittee, expressed concern that Verizon and Comcast would no longer compete as vigorously. “The fundamental question we must answer is whether these deals will bring beneficial new choices to consumers, or amount to previously fierce rivals standing down from competition.” Lawmakers have no official role in the legal review. During the hearing, Verizon and Comcast executives said that the spectrum sale and marketing agreement, which were announced at the same time, were being reviewed by antitrust and telecommunications regulators separately. “They are not contingent upon one another,” added Verizon Communications General Counsel Randall Milch. Comcast Executive Vice President David Cohen concurred: “I do not disagree with Mr. Milch. There is no legal connection between them.” Senator Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, noted in his comments that under the marketing agreement, each time Verizon or Comcast sold the other’s product there would be a one-time commission of “a few hundred dollars.” In his testimony, Milch argued that his company had spent billions to better use the spectrum it had but needed more because of the explosive use of spectrum-hogging smartphones, tablets and video and audio streaming. “We do not believe that we can engineer our way out of the spectrum crunch,” he told the Senate Judiciary Committee’s antitrust subcommittee. Data use on Verizon’s network has more than doubled each of the last three years, and is expected to continue growing, according to the company. But Steven Berry, president of RCA, a trade group of smaller wireless providers, urged regulators to block the deals, saying they would have an “insidious and disastrous effect on competition.” If not blocked, he urged the imposition of stringent conditions like spectrum divestitures and affordable roaming for smaller competitors. “Through the spectrum transaction, related marketing deals, and joint venture between the companies, Verizon will not compete for wired services with the cable companies, and the cable companies will not compete for wireless service with Verizon,” Berry said in written testimony. Former antitrust enforcers have said that the marketing deals would create allies out of former rivals, to the detriment of consumers. The Justice Department is known to be looking at the agreements. Comcast’s Cohen defended the marketing agreements and said they should arouse no concern. “The commercial agreements at issue here are ordinary and customary, market standard agreements. There is no merger here,” he said. “Not one competitor will be removed from the marketplace.” Verizon Wireless is a joint venture of Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L). Verizon Wireless rivals, including Sprint Nextel Corp (S.N), T-Mobile USA and MetroPCS Communications Inc PCS.N, have urged regulators to block the Verizon deals. Deutsche Telekom AG’s (DTEGn.DE) T-Mobile said the deals would result in “an excessive concentration” of spectrum holdings. Verizon Wireless and AT&T;, the No. 1 and No. 2 U.S. mobile providers, have said they need more spectrum to support increased consumer demand for videos and other services that soak up bandwidth. Rick Rule, an antitrust expert at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP who testified on Wednesday, predicted the spectrum deal would be approved by the Justice Department. “A transaction that takes assets that are producing zero and is going to put the assets in hands of a company that is going to generate some output from those assets is by definition not a violation of the antitrust laws,” he said.

266,VZ,Activists responsible for most data theft in 2011-survey,"* Verizon survey finds “hactivists” got 58% of stolen data * Hactivism had not been cited in previous surveys * Experts say intellectual property theft still a threat By Jim Finkle BOSTON, March 22 (Reuters) - Activists who hack into government and corporate computer networks and then release files to embarrass those organizations were responsible for more than half of all data thefts last year, according to a new  sur vey. That’s a big change from recent years when the motivation behind most cyber attacks has been to make money, according to Verizon Communications Inc, which outlined its finding in one of the biggest annual global surveys on data loss. The telecommunication company’s own researchers and law enforcement agencies in five countries came to the conclusion after reviewing ro ughly 17 4 million records stolen in 855 incidents. They found that 58 percent of the stolen data was due to s o-called “hactivism” l ast year, while no losses had been attributed to that cause in previous surveys. “It’s not just about the money anymore. It’s a big change in our adversaries,” said Bryan Sartin, head of Verizon’s computer forensics unit and co-author of the survey. Anonymous, a loosely organized collective that is the most prominent hactivist group, claimed responsibility for a string of incidents last year, beginning with attacks on the websites of the governments of Tunisia, Algeria and Zimbabwe. Other targets included military contractors, law enforcement agencies and corporations including Sony Corp, News Corp  and Apple Inc. In a major blow to Anonymous, U.S. authorities revealed earlier this month that a leading hacker secretly became an FBI informant last year, providing evidence that led to charges against five other suspected leaders of the international hacking group. Cyber security analysts said that they expect hactivism to continue, though it may not be as severe. “It may be episodic with peaks and valleys,” said Andy Purdy, chief cyber security strategist for CSC, which helps companies and government agencies fight cyber attacks. Mary Landesman, senior security researcher with Cisco Systems Inc, said that she thinks the influence of hactivists will wane. She believes that the hackers who are arrested get caught because they become too focused on a need to become famous and make mistakes that enable law enforcement to catch them. “That has discredited Anonymous as a whole,” she said. “When you see your buddy going off to jail, it’s a great sobering force.” Verizon said that it does not know what percent of all data breaches is accounted for in its survey. It does not make sense to compare data from 2011 with that of previous years because it collected information from more law enforcement agencies than in earlier surveys. CSC’s Purdy said that businesses need to keep their eye on intellectual property theft, which did not score as high on Verizon’s survey. Only about 4 percent of records stolen were related to intellectual property, yet those secrets clearly have more value than that number would suggest. Some 39 percent of breaches affecting large organizations targeted sensitive organizational data, copyrighted information, trade secrets and classified information. “Systematic online theft of intellectual property rises to the level of national security significance because of its impact on competitiveness on major American companies,” said Purdy, a former Department of Homeland Security official responsibility for cyber security. In November a U.S. intelligence report to Congress warned that China and Russia are using cyber espionage to steal U.S. trade and technology secrets to bolster their own economic development and that poses a threat to U.S. prosperity and security. Verizon said that it obtained data from the U.S. Secret Service, the Dutch National High Tech Crime Unit, the Australian Federal Police, the Irish Reporting & Information Security Service and the Police Central e-Crime Unit of the London Metropolitan Police. The company said that nearly all of the attacks were not highly difficult to launch and could have been avoided if the victims had done a better job of implementing basic security measures. “I’d love to tell you we see a lot of indications that companies are getting better and more secure,” Sartin said. “But if you look at where these companies are falling down, it’s still unfortunately in common sense.”",3222012,http://www.reuters.com/article/cyberattacks/activists-responsible-for-most-data-theft-in-2011-survey-idUSL1E8QL0EW20120322

He had earlier estimated 786,000 net adds. Verizon will, however, continue to grow the postpaid business ahead of rivals such as AT&T; Inc, Sprint Nextel Corp and T-Mobile, Atkin added. Atkin reduced his estimate on Verizon’s first-quarter wireline margins to 22.5 percent from 23.4 percent, citing lack of acceleration in the global enterprise segment and continuing wholesale pressures. Atkin is a five-star rated analyst for the accuracy of his  earnings estimates on Verizon, and ranks first among 34 analysts covering the stock, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. In January, the company had reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $2.02 billion, or 71 cents per share, compared with a profit of $2.64 billion, or 93 cents a share, a year earlier.

268,VZ,RPT-COLUMN-An end to phones in every home? David Cay Johnston,"By David Cay Johnston March 28 (Reuters) - The guarantee of landline telephone service at almost any address, a legal right many Americans may not even know they have, is quietly being legislated away in our U.S. state capitals. AT&T; and Verizon, the dominant telephone companies, want to end their 99-year-old universal service obligation known as “provider of last resort.” They say universal landline service is a costly and unfair anachronism that is no longer justified because of a competitive market for voice services. The new rules AT&T; and Verizon drafted would enhance profits by letting them serve only the customers they want. Their focus, and that of smaller phone companies that have the same universal service obligation, is on well-populated areas where people can afford profitable packages that combine telephone, Internet and cable television. Sprint, T-Mobile and the cell phone divisions of AT&T; and Verizon are not subject to universal service and can serve only those areas they find profitable. Unless the new rules are written very carefully, millions of people, urban and rural, will lose basic telephone service or be forced to pay much more for calls. Florida, North Carolina, Texas and Wisconsin already have repealed universal service obligations. No one has been cut off yet, but once almost every state has ended universal service I am sure we will see parts of the landline system shut down. Years of subtle incremental legal changes have brought the telephone companies within sight of ending universal service, which began in 1913 when AT&T; President Thomas Vail promised “one system, one policy, universal service” in return for keeping Ma Bell’s monopoly. AT&T; wants universal service obligations to end wherever two or more voice services are available, said Joel Lubin, AT&T;’s public policy vice president. Verizon promotes a similar approach. State capitals are seeing intense lobbying to end universal service obligations but with little public awareness due to the dwindling ranks () of statehouse () reporters. The Utility Rate Network, a consumer advocate group, identified 120 AT&T; lobbyists in Sacramento, one per California lawmaker. Mary Pat Regan, president of AT&T; Kentucky, told me she has 36 lobbyists in that state working on the company’s bill to end universal landline service. People whose landline service ends would have three options. First would be a cell phone, a reasonable substitute in many areas. But cell phones do not work in Appalachian valleys and many rural expanses. Cell phones cost at least $25 for limited minutes, while lifeline services - which the companies offer to low-income people - start at $2 and, with unlimited local calls, at about $10. Second would be Internet calling. That requires broadband Internet service. Verizon charges $49.99, plus additional charges by unregulated calling companies like Vonage, whose rates start at $25.99.

Residents said, “We want to see your plans before you start drilling holes, and Verizon said, ‘We will drill where we want or else, so we’re walking,’ and they did,” Brand told me. Verizon confirmed that because of the disagreement Brand’s building is not wired. And there’s nothing Brand can do about it. Verizon reminded me the state Board of Public Utilities no longer has authority to resolve complaints over FiOS. Market forces cannot discipline this kind of one-sided power. Verizon says that New Jersey requires it to wire only 70 cities.

271,VZ,CORRECTED-COLUMN-An end to phones in every home? David Cay Johnston,"By David Cay Johnston March 28 (Reuters) - The guarantee of landline telephone service at almost any address, a legal right many Americans may not even know they have, is quietly being legislated away in our U.S. state capitals. AT&T; and Verizon, the dominant telephone companies, want to end their 99-year-old universal service obligation known as “provider of last resort.” They say universal landline service is a costly and unfair anachronism that is no longer justified because of a competitive market for voice services. The new rules AT&T; and Verizon drafted would enhance profits by letting them serve only the customers they want. Their focus, and that of smaller phone companies that have the same universal service obligation, is on well-populated areas where people can afford profitable packages that combine telephone, Internet and cable television. Sprint, T-Mobile and the cell phone divisions of AT&T; and Verizon are not subject to universal service and can serve only those areas they find profitable. Unless the new rules are written very carefully, millions of people, urban and rural, will lose basic telephone service or be forced to pay much more for calls. Florida, North Carolina, Texas and Wisconsin already have repealed universal service obligations. No one has been cut off yet, but once almost every state has ended universal service I am sure we will see parts of the landline system shut down. Years of subtle incremental legal changes have brought the telephone companies within sight of ending universal service, which began in 1913 when AT&T; President Theodore Vail promised “one system, one policy, universal service” in return for keeping Ma Bell’s monopoly. AT&T; wants universal service obligations to end wherever two or more voice services are available, said Joel Lubin, AT&T;’s public policy vice president. Verizon promotes a similar approach. State capitals are seeing intense lobbying to end universal service obligations but with little public awareness due to the dwindling ranks () of statehouse () reporters. The Utility Rate Network, a consumer advocate group, identified 120 AT&T; lobbyists in Sacramento, one per California lawmaker. Mary Pat Regan, president of AT&T; Kentucky, told me she has 36 lobbyists in that state working on the company’s bill to end universal landline service. People whose landline service ends would have three options. First would be a cell phone, a reasonable substitute in many areas. But cell phones do not work in Appalachian valleys and many rural expanses. Cell phones cost at least $25 for limited minutes, while lifeline services - which the companies offer to low-income people - start at $2 and, with unlimited local calls, at about $10. Second would be Internet calling. That requires broadband Internet service. Verizon charges $49.99, plus additional charges by unregulated calling companies like Vonage, whose rates start at $25.99. On top of this $75 expense would be taxes and the cost of buying and maintaining a computer, a device alien to many older and poor Americans. Third would be satellite service.

273,VZ,Ex-Lala CEO hopes Verizon will add green to Color,"SAN FRANCISCO, May 7 (Reuters) - Much-maligned social-video sharing company Color is trying once again f or a shot at success by tying up Verizon, according to a post on Color’s blog on Monday. Color raised $41 million in first-round funding. Most other startups are lucky to raise $5 million or $10 million at that stage. But the company has struggled to catch on with consumers. It has provided plenty of ammunition to those who argue Silicon Valley is in the throes of a consumer-Internet bubble. If the alliance with Verizon, which will make the app available on its high-speed 4G LTE network, boosts Color user numbers, it will show founder Bill Nguyen still has his magic touch. A serial entrepreneur, Nguyen is perhaps best known for founding music service Lala and selling to Apple Inc for about $85 million in 2009. If the alliance fails to raise Color’s numbers, it will boost the case of people who argue that many startups have unproven business plans that don’t match the cash they’re raising from venture capitalists. “The consumer environment is getting pretty heated,” one venture capitalist said echoing the comments of many of his colleagues in recent months. Nguyen believes the ability to share live video without the lags and glitches that come on slower-speed networks will give the company a leg up, he said in an interview. He envisions families capturing milestones like children’s birthday parties for absent grandparents, or people capturing political demonstrations and the like. “We’re good enough to replace a tweet,” he said, referring to the instant messages sent on micro-blogging service Twitter about live happenings. “We’ll replace recorded video.” Color, which allows its users to share video with all or some of their Facebook friends, started as a photo-sharing service last year. It changed gears after a few months to focus on video. About 1 million users have downloaded its free app, but the company declined to say how many use it regularly. Nguyen said he is not bothered by the fits and starts, noting that Lala started as a CD-trading company before becoming an online music company. T h at service took several years to gain traction before attracting millions of users and eventually selling to Apple Inc. for about $85 million in 2009. For Verizon, the attraction lies in helping the company boost its 4G service, which has about 8 million customers— about 9 percent of its customer base, said spokeswoman Debra Lewis. “Video is a great application to use on that network,” she said, adding the company’s video-harnessing NFL app is one of its most popular on its 3G and 4G networks. Color will come preloaded on some of its phones later this year. Color’s videos are limited to 30 seconds. While other live-video sharing services exist, Nguyen said Color’s technology makes it better. Eventually, he plans to make money from the app using advertising. Color’s backers include Sequoia Capital, Bain Capital Ventures, and Silicon Valley Bank. Color declined to disclose terms of the deal.

278,VZ,Rising legal costs push TiVo into the red,"(Reuters) - TiVo Inc (TIVO.O) reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss and forecast another loss for the current quarter as the maker of digital television recorders fights costly legal battles to protect its patents. The company faces rising legal costs as it fights patent lawsuits against a number of companies, including Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), Motorola Mobility Inc and Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N, related to its video recording technology. A big part of TiVo’s business relies on money it generates from settlements it receives protecting its intellectual property. TiVo settled a patent lawsuit with Verizon’s rival AT&T; Inc (T.N) in January, after the wireless operator agreed to pay the company at least $215 million as well as monthly licensing fees. Legal costs are expected to rise sharply in the second quarter as the company prepares to go to trial with Verizon, TiVo CEO Tom Rogers said in an interview with Reuters. TiVo, whose brand is synonymous with digital video recorders, also expects to ramp up spending on marketing as it rolls out a digital video recording product with Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), Rogers said. The company forecast a second-quarter net loss of $28 million to $30 million, while analysts were expecting a $16 million loss, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net loss for the first quarter was $20.8 million, or 17 cents per share, compared with a profit of $139 million, or $1.04 per share, a year earlier. In the year ago quarter, TiVo’s profit included a one-time payment of $175.7 million from DISH Network Corp (DISH.O) related to the settlement of another patent infringement lawsuit. Revenue rose 48 percent to $67.8 million. Total subscriptions rose by 524,000, or 27 percent, to about 2.5 million. Operating costs more than doubled to $54.2 million.

288,VZ,"Verizon raises FiOS bills, adds higher Web speeds","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications (VZ.N) is raising prices for some FiOS customers as it offers higher speeds, a move that one analyst says will potentially lead to higher prices from cable rivals such as Cablevision Systems Corp CVC.N. The telephone company said it expects the majority of its FiOS Internet customers to have to pay $10 to $15 more per month to avail of new offerings, but it noted that they could change their television package to keep their monthly fee unchanged. Verizon competes with cable operators for television and telephone customers as well as Internet users with various bundle service options. ISI Group analyst Vijay Jayant described the new pricing structure as aggressive especially for consumers who have instead seen price freezes or even promotions from rivals like Cablevision. He said it may lead cable companies to charge more. “The glass half full ... is that Verizon’s pricing posture is a sign of increased price rationality,” said Jayant adding that this “could perhaps foreshadow renewed price increases for the incumbent, Cablevision.” Verizon will stop selling its 25 megabits per second (mbps) and 35 mbps service plans and will instead offer 50 mbps and 75 mbps plans to new customers or existing customers at the end of their contracts. It will keep its entry level 15 mbps service available but Arturo Picicci, Verizon’s director of product management, said he expects most customers to move away from this service as they are craving more bandwidth to connect more devices, tablets and smartphones on top of traditional computers inside their homes. “We’re expecting that 80 percent of customers will want more than 15 megabits per second,” said Picicci referring to Verizon’s slowest FiOS service speed. Today a Verizon customer paying for a $109.99 plan would get unlimited phone calls, 15 mbps download speeds and 290 channels. An upgrade to 50 mbps would cost $124.99 a month unless the customer opted to receive a package with fewer TV channels. Verizon also said on Monday that it is cutting the price of what was previously its fastest Internet service as it introduces a new service that has double the speed, amping up technology competition with rivals Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), Time Warner Cable TWC.N and Cablevision. Excluding other fees, Verizon said it has cut the price of its 150 megabits-per-second service to $99.99 a month from $209.99, bringing it in line with pricing against its rivals’ fastest speeds. Verizon also said on Monday it will charge $209.99 a month for a new 300 megabits per second (mbps) service, or $204.99 for users with a two-year contract, starting today. This compares with No. 1 rival Comcast’s fastest service, which costs $200 a month for speeds of 105 mbps, and rival Cablevision’s speediest offering which is $104.95 for 101 mbps. “We’re bringing 150 mbps more to the mainstream,” Picicci told Reuters. “Cable cannot touch us here.” However, Verizon customers who do not opt for two-year contracts for either of the two fastest services would have to pay an upgrade fee of $100 to have those services installed.

289,VZ,"UPDATE 1-Verizon raises FiOS bills, adds higher Web speeds","* Says majority of FiOS users will pay $10-15 more * Could change TV package to offset higher Internet fee * To offer 150 mbps for $100, 300 mbps for $210 * Verizon shares close up 0.62 pct at $43.82 NEW YORK, June 18 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications  is raising prices for some FiOS customers as it offers higher speeds, a move that one analyst says will potentially lead to higher prices from cable rivals such as Cablevision Systems Corp . The telephone company said it expects the majority of its FiOS Internet customers to have to pay $10 to $15 more per month to avail of new offerings, but it noted that they could change their television package to keep their monthly fee unchanged. Verizon competes with cable operators for television and telephone customers as well as Internet users with various bundle service options. ISI Group analyst Vijay Jayant described the new pricing structure as aggressive especially for consumers who have instead seen price freezes or even promotions from rivals like Cablevision. He said it may lead cable companies to charge more. “The glass half full ... is that Verizon’s pricing posture is a sign of increased price rationality,” said Jayant adding that this “could perhaps foreshadow renewed price increases for the incumbent, Cablevision.” Verizon will stop selling its 25 megabits per second (mbps) and 35 mbps service plans and will instead offer 50 mbps and 75 mbps plans to new customers or existing customers at the end of  their contracts. It will keep its entry level 15 mbps service available but Arturo Picicci, Verizon’s director of product management, said he expects most customers to move away from this service as they are craving more bandwidth to connect more devices, tablets and smartphones on top of traditional computers inside their homes. “We’re expecting that 80 percent of customers will want more than 15 megabits per second,” said Picicci referring to Verizon’s slowest FiOS service speed. Today a Verizon customer paying for a $109.99 plan would get unlimited phone calls, 15 mbps download speeds and 290 channels. An upgrade to 50 mbps would cost $124.99 a month unless the customer opted to receive a package with fewer TV channels. Verizon also said on Monday that it is cutting the price of what was previously its fastest Internet service as it introduces a new service that has double the speed, amping up technology competition with rivals Comcast Corp, Time Warner Cable and Cablevision. Excluding other fees, Verizon said it has cut the price of its 150 megabits-per-second service to $99.99 a month from $209.99, bringing it in line with pricing against its rivals’ fastest speeds. Verizon also said on Monday it will charge $209.99 a month for a new 300 megabits per second (mbps) service, or $204.99 for users with a two-year contract, starting today. This compares with No. 1 rival Comcast’s fastest service, which costs $200 a month for speeds of 105 mbps, and rival Cablevision’s speediest offering which is $104.95 for 101 mbps. “We’re bringing 150 mbps more to the mainstream,” Picicci told Reuters. “Cable cannot touch us here.” However, Verizon customers who do not opt for two-year contracts for either of the two fastest services would have to pay an upgrade fee of $100 to have those services installed.

293,VZ,"UPDATE 2-Verizon, T-Mobile USA agree on spectrum deal","* T-Mobile to get access to 60 mln people * T-Mobile to pay Verizon in spectrum and cash * T-Mobile gives up opposition to Verizon Wireless’ cable spectrum deal By Nicola Leske NEW YORK, June 25 (Reuters) - Verizon Wireless and Deutsche Telekom’s U.S. unit have agreed to a spectrum deal that may clear the way for the U.S. company’s plans to buy a chunk of spectrum from cable providers. The agreement, which needs approval by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Department of Justice, included exchanges of spectrum between the two carriers and a cash payment from T-Mobile USA, the companies said on Monday. They declined to divulge financials of the deal but analysts estimated that T-Mobile USA would pay around $260 million. In addition, T-Mobile USA said it had given up its opposition to Verizon Wireless’ proposal to buy spectrum from cable companies. A T-Mobile USA spokeswoman said that “our agreement with Verizon will alleviate the public interest harms of their transaction with the cable companies as originally proposed”, adding that “with FCC approval of these divestitures, we now support prompt approval of Verizon’s transaction along with our transaction”. Verizon Wireless had said in April that it plans to put a chunk of wireless spectrum up for sale, potentially improving its chances of gaining regulatory approval to buy about $3.9 billion worth of wireless airwaves from cable companies including Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable Inc . The spectrum buy would be part of broader agreements to create a joint venture and allow the cable operators to resell Verizon’s mobile service. That plan was opposed by several smaller rivals — among them T-Mobile USA — who had complained to the FCC about the bigger company’s cable deal on concerns that it would give too much market power to the already dominant company. Some analysts suggested that Verizon had reached out to T-Mobile USA to clear the way for FCC approval. “T-Mobile was the most vocal SpectrumCo deal opponent remaining and we think Verizon was either proactive in reaching an agreement with T-Mobile or encouraged to do so,” Macquarie Equities research said in a note, adding that “either way, this is likely a win-win for both companies”. T-Mobile USA, the No. 4 U.S. carrier, has been scrambling to improve its business and stem customer losses, exacerbated by a nine-month period in 2011 when it was focused on seeking approval for a proposed $39 billion takeover by AT&T;  which collapsed in December. The deal would improve its position in some parts of the United States because it will receive spectrum covering 60 million people in exchange for spectrum given to Verizon Wireless covering 22 million people “As a result of this transaction, T-Mobile USA will gain AWS (Advanced Wireless Services) spectrum in many regions of the Northeast where it has historically had a weak portfolio, and give up small portions of spectrum in California where it has ample spectrum holdings,” Bernstein analyst Robin Bienenstock said. Consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge said the agreement between T-Mobile USA and Verizon proved that Verizon Wireless’ cable spectrum -plans would not be beneficial for consumers. “That Verizon Wireless feels the need to buy off T-Mobile to close its spectrum/marketing deals with the country’s largest cable operators underscores just how bad this deal really is for American consumers and competition generally,” said Harold Feld, legal director at Public Knowledge. “As Public Knowledge has consistently pointed out, the true danger lies not only in the concentration of spectrum in the hands of the leading wireless provider, but with the cozy, cartel-like arrangements between Verizon, Comcast, and the other MSOs (Multi System Operators) party to the deal,” he added.

294,VZ,Verizon dismisses patent from TiVo suit,"NEW YORK, July 6 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications  has dismissed a patent from its case against TiVo Inc, leaving the telephone company with only patent claim against the digital video recorder developer. “The filing today doesn’t affect the substance of Verizon’s case or our likelihood of success. These were simply procedural steps,” Verizon spokesman Ed McFadden said. The company had originally filed six patent claims against TiVo related to video-recording technology. TiVo declined to comment. MDC analyst Michael Cohen said the dismissal is “incrementally good” for TiVo because none of its patents have been dismissed, while Verizon has had five dismissed. Cohen said he expects a trial for the case to start in October unless the companies settle. In January, AT&T; Inc agreed to pay TiVo at least $215 million plus monthly licensing fees to settle patent litigation. Verizon said in a court document filed on Friday that it was dismissing U.S. Patent 6,367,078 from the case, which would prevent it from later asserting the patent against TiVo.

295,VZ,"AT&T;, Verizon shares on tear ahead of 2nd-quarter earnings","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Don’t expect much of a pop from shares of Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and AT&T; Inc (T.N), even if the two companies surpass analysts’ second-quarter expectations. That’s because shares in the top U.S. telephone companies have already risen sharply this year due to their high dividend yields and earnings and revenue stability amid an uncertain global economy and low U.S. Treasury interest rates. Verizon’s stock has risen almost 13 percent so far this year while AT&T; shares are up about 17 percent. “They’re big. They’re safe and they offer dividend yields,” said Pivotal Research analyst Steve Sweeney, explaining the stronger-than-usual demand for the telecom shares. Verizon’s dividend yield of 4.4 percent and AT&T;’s 4.9 percent yield have become increasingly attractive to risk-averse investors looking for alternatives to 10-year treasury notes carrying an interest rate that had fallen to 1.45 percent from 1.88 percent at the end of last year. “That gap, the extra yield you’re getting by buying AT&T; and Verizon, is a near 20-year high,” said Deutsche Bank analyst Brett Feldman, who has a “hold” rating on the stocks and views them as “fully valued.” Verizon currently trades at about 16 times analysts’ earnings-per-share forward estimates, while AT&T; trades at a multiple of 14. The average trading multiple for S&P; 500 companies is 12.2, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine Data. With macroeconomic uncertainty — particularly in Europe — continuing to be a major factor, analysts say there is no clear reason why the telephone companies’ shares should decline. But they also say it is unlikely the stocks will rise much further. “I don’t think we’ll see the potential for much multiple expansion from here,” said Pivotal’s Sweeney, who has “hold” ratings on both Verizon and AT&T.; While Evercore analyst Jonathan Schildkraut views Verizon shares as “expensive,” he added that, “with limited changes in the broader macro picture, and what we expect to be a steady quarter, the summer of love for Verizon is likely to continue.” Investors expect solid growth in the second quarter from AT&T; and Verizon as they work on reining in costs and pushing for revenue growth from wireless data services. On June 28 U.S. market leader Verizon Wireless — Verizon’s venture with Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L) — kicked off a new way of billing customers aimed at convincing them to connect other devices to its network beyond phones. AT&T; is expected to follow with a similar move to so-called shared-data plans. Investors expect the changes to eventually boost revenue but they will not be a factor in the second quarter. When Verizon reports results on July 19, Verizon Wireless is expected to lead U.S. growth with almost 666,000 new subscribers, according to seven analysts. Their estimates range from 440,00 to 878,000. AT&T;, the No. 2 U.S. mobile provider, is seen adding about 233,000 subscribers, according to six analysts. AT&T; is scheduled to report results July 24. Both companies are likely to add customers from smaller rivals such as No. 3 U.S. mobile service provider Sprint Nextel Corp (S.N), which is expected to lose over 203,000 subscribers in the quarter, according to five analysts. “One of the reasons investors feel comfortable right now with AT&T; and Verizon is that the near term for earnings looks firm,” said Deutsche Bank’s Feldman. Last year the two operators felt heavy pressure on wireless profit margins as record sales of iPhones pushed up costs. Verizon Wireless, AT&T; and Sprint all pay hefty subsidies to Apple Inc (AAPL.O) for each iPhone they sell, and they use big device discounts to lure customers to two-year contracts. But this year, profit margins at AT&T; and Verizon are expected to improve as both companies have taken steps to slow the rate at which their customers upgrade to new smartphones. “Because of the discipline they’ve shown there, investors expect to see better margins this year,” Feldman said. “Q2 will likely confirm that near term operating trends are showing solid performance of revenue and margins.” Analysts estimate Verizon Wireless’ service profit margin based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization will rise to roughly 47 percent or higher in the second quarter from 46.3 percent in the first quarter and 42.2 percent in the fourth quarter, when the iPhone was launched. AT&T;’s profit margin is expected to rise to about 42 percent in the second quarter from 41.6 percent in the first quarter and 28.7 percent in the fourth quarter, when it incurred its heaviest expenses from the iPhone. Verizon’s earnings per share is expected to increase by 12 percent to 64 cents on a revenue gain of 3 percent to $28.59 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S Analysts expect AT&T; to report an earnings increase of about 5 percent to 63 cents, and revenue is estimated rising about 1 percent to $31.786 billion. AT&T; shares rose 0.6 percent at $35.63 early Tuesday on New York Stock Exchange. The stock ended 2011 at $30.24. Verizon was up 0.4 percent at $45.46. The stock ended 2011 at $40.12.

296,VZ,"Verizon wireline disappoints, shares off 2.9 percent","(Reuters) - Weakness in Verizon Communications Inc’s enterprise business offset a better-than-expected wireless quarter, sending the telephone company’s shares down 2.9 percent. After pushing Verizon’s shares up 14 percent so far this year, investors focused in on the wireline miss on Thursday even as Verizon handily beat Wall Street estimates for wireless subscriber growth and profitability. While earnings per share (EPS) met Wall Street expectations for the quarter, analyst said that wasn’t enough. “The view by investors is that wireline stole the EPS benefit of a great wireless quarter,” Nomura analyst Michael McCormack said. Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo told analysts on a conference call that Verizon’s enterprise business was hurt by foreign exchange rates and a decision to stop selling some customer equipment and, to a lesser extent, by macroeconomic challenges in Europe. But McCormack said the world economy’s impact may have been understated. “The global economy may be more sluggish than people believe at this point. It seems (for) anything outside large multinationals, you’re seeing very sluggish buying behavior,” he said. Verizon’s wireline revenue fell 3.4 percent in the quarter to $9.93 billion compared with Wall Street expectations of $10.03 billion, according to the company. While Verizon saw strong revenue growth in its consumer wireline business, Shammo said its addition of 120,000 net new FiOS television customers was weaker than it expected as an unusually high number of people moved from the FiOS region. Shammo said Verizon was reducing its target estimate for future FiOS TV growth to 150,000 to 170,000 from its previous estimate of 180,000 to 200,000 as the company is increasing its prices to focus more on the profitability of the service. The executive told Reuters that he expects Verizon’s wireline revenue growth rate from consumer services to rise to 5 percent by the end of the year from 2.5 percent in the second quarter as the company plans more price increases. The company raised prices in the second quarter with service packages that include higher Internet speeds, but Shammo warned there would be more price increases for TV bundles. “We started in the second quarter but there’s more on the plate for the third and fourth quarter,” Shammo said. Guggenheim Securities analyst Sing Yin said consumers may have no choice but to pay higher fees for TV as programmers increase their rates. He also expects them to embrace pricier Internet services. “They’re counting on consumers being willing to pay more for better speed. So far, there is evidence there is demand for higher speeds at higher prices,” Yin said. In response to rumors about a dividend payment, Shammo said that the board of the company’s Verizon Wireless venture with Vodafone Group Plc does not plan to discuss a distribution at its next quarterly board meeting. Vodafone shares fell 1.7 percent in London trading after the comment. Verizon Wireless added 888,000 net new subscribers in the quarter, compared with the average expectation of about 666,000 of seven analysts. “That’s a terrific number,” Roe Equity Research analyst Kevin Roe said, noting that Wall Street does not expect No. 2 mobile provider AT&T; Inc to add even half as many customers in the quarter. The growth at the No. 1 U.S. mobile provider probably came at the expense of smaller rivals Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile USA in particular, as those companies have been struggling to stem customer losses, Roe said. The company said that 50 percent of its wireless customers were using smartphones by the end of the second quarter, up from 47 percent at the end of the first quarter. Since smartphone customers spend more than customers with basic phones, Verizon has been pushing to increase its smartphone penetration. Verizon Wireless launched new shared data service plans June 28 that raised its data fees in exchange for letting customers connect multiple devices under one plan. The plan is aimed at getting consumers to more devices to its network[ID:nL1E8HC3EE]. While the shared data launch was too late in the quarter to have an effect on the company’s results, Shammo said that early consumer feedback had been “great.” Verizon’s wireless service margin based on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization was 49 percent, ahead of average estimates of five analysts for just above 47 percent. Verizon’s second-quarter profit rose to $1.83 billion, or 64 cents per share, from $1.61 billion, or 57 cents per share, a year earlier. The results were in line with analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose to $28.552 billion from $27.54 billion, while analysts were expecting $28.558 billion. Verizon said on Thursday that its 2012 capital spending would be little changed or lower than its 2011 budget of $16.2 billion. During the company’s last earnings call, Shammo had expected 2012 spending to be about the same as in 2011. The company said it was on track for growth in full-year earnings in the double-digit percentage range, implying a rise of at least 10 percent. It expected profit margins in its wireline business to continue to improve in the second half of the year after increasing in the second quarter from the first quarter. Verizon hopes to improve earnings by reducing costs in negotiations for new terms for a labor contract covering 45,000 workers but the company appeared to be nowhere nearer to an agreement on Thursday almost a year after its workers went on strike to protest the cuts Verizon wants to make.

Overall, the 13 top U.S. broadband providers, representing four-fifths of all U.S. landline broadband connections, are coming much closer to consistently delivering their advertised speeds, the Federal Communications Commission said on Thursday. U.S. broadband speeds on average are within 90 percent of what they promote, up from within 80 percent when the FCC issued its initial report last year. FCC analysis concluded that the improvements were mostly due to greater investments and upgrades to broadband networks, not downward adjustments in advertised speeds. Broadband customers, on average, subscribed to faster speed tiers and experienced actual speeds nearly 38 percent faster than a year ago, the FCC said. Consumers spent more time online and using more data-intensive services, like video streaming, the agency added. During peak consumer usage hours when networks are busiest, actual download speeds varied from 120 percent to 79 percent of advertised speed among the different ISPs. Verizon’s fiber network, Cablevision, Comcast Corp, Mediacom Communications and Charter Communications Inc all routinely delivered nearly 100 percent or greater of the speed advertised, even during the hours of highest demand, the FCC said. Cablevision had been last year’s worst performer, delivering just 54 percent of its advertised speed during peak hours. Frontier Communications Corp was at the bottom of the pack in the latest FCC report, but it still delivered 79 percent of advertised performance, reflecting the general improvement. Frontier spokeswoman Christy Reap said the company tripled its size two years ago to cover more rural areas, and has, and will, continue to make investments to increase speed and capacity. The FCC said the U.S. market is moving toward the agency’s goal of having at least 100 million homes with affordable access to actual download speeds of at least 50 megabits per second by 2015, and 100 Mbps by 2020, the FCC said. Actual speeds experienced by consumers increased to 14.6 Mbps from 10.6 Mbps a year ago, according to the report. Speeds from 1 Mbps to 2 Mbps are used to stream standard video, while consumers wanting to watch full high-definition video online need speeds upwards of 5 Mbps. The FCC said it will conduct more testing this fall and release another report by the end of the year. “To realize the full power of broadband’s potential, we must continue to see increases in broadband speed and capacity and decreases in per gigabit costs,” FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski said. The ISPs in the FCC study, ranked by performance as a percentage of advertised speed, were: Verizon’s fiber network (120 percent), Cablevision (120 percent), Comcast (103 percent), Mediacom (100 percent), Charter (98 percent), Time Warner Cable Inc (96 percent), Cox Communications (95 percent), Insight Communications Co (92 percent), CenturyLink Inc (89 percent), AT&T; Inc (87 percent), Verizon’s DSL network (87 percent), Windstream Corp (84 percent), Qwest Communications (83 percent) and Frontier (79 percent).

303,VZ,Analysts raise Verizon price target on wireless growth,"(Reuters) - Several brokerages raised their price target on Verizon Communications Inc’s (VZ.N) stock, upbeat on the company’s potential in its mobile phone business as a growing number of customers switch to high-margin smartphones. On Thursday, Verizon posted quarterly profits in line with analysts’ estimates as it added more wireless subscribers than anticipated. Analysts said Verizon’s leadership in its U.S. mobile phone market will continue to drive growth and help it gain a larger share of the postpaid market with growing adoption of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) mobile standard. LTE technology — pegged as the successor for 3G mobile voice and data standards — promises broadband-like internet speeds on mobile handsets. “We expect Verizon to continue to gain postpaid market share given its industry leading churn, a leadership position in LTE and the expected release of an LTE capable iPhone as soon as the fourth quarter,” Citi Investment Research analyst, Michael Rollins wrote in a note. He raised his price target on the stock to $45 from $44. Verizon Communications’ mobile phone joint venture with UK’s Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L) added 888,000 net new subscribers in the second quarter, compared with the average expectation of about 666,000 of seven analysts. J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Philip Cusick said Verizon’s wireless EBITDA margin could exceed a record 50 percent in the current quarter driven by smartphone sales and an expected iPhone launch later in September. EBITDA margin, based on the segment’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, was 49 percent in the second quarter, ahead of average estimates of five analysts for just above 47 percent. Cusick raised his price target to $49 from $45. At least seven other brokerages also raised their price target on the Company’s stock which provides communication, information and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and governmental agencies. Verizon shares fell 1.5 percent to $43.85 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.

305,VZ,US consumer agency opposes 'cramming' phone fees settlement,"* Landline customers face unauthorized phone bill fees * Practice costs consumers $2 billion a year * FTC calls proposed settlement “inadequate” * Settlement would end 2009 lawsuit brought in California By Joseph Ax Aug 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. consumer protection agency opposes a tentative settlement that would refund Verizon Communications Inc phone customers for unauthorized fees, calling it inadequate and  claiming it could undermine government efforts to crack down on the practice. The fees, known in the phone industry as “cramming,” cost consumers $2 billion a year, according to a Senate inquiry completed last year. Phone companies add charges from third-party companies and marketers on monthly bills mailed to landline customers, who typically have no idea they are being charged or believe incorrectly that the charges are legitimate, consumer advocates say. Lawyers for the class-action plaintiffs said they were disappointed with the Federal Trade Commission’s opposition to the deal reached in February, saying it was the best settlement that could be achieved. The settlement has yet to be approved by the presiding judge in U.S. District Court in California. The FTC, which protects consumer interests, along with various states and the Federal Communications Commission, targeted cramming in recent years as an abusive practice. The charges list services such as music downloads, voicemail, ringtones and online news and can add anywhere from $1.99 to $19.99 a month to a phone bill. The proposed settlement reached in February between a class of consumers and Verizon, would end a 2009 lawsuit brought in California. A hearing is scheduled before a federal judge next month to consider final approval. The proposed settlement does not have a total dollar amount because it would depend on how many customers choose to participate. In a brief dated Friday, the FTC argued that most customers would ignore settlement notices because they do not realize they have paid the charges, while those who file claims would be forced to go through an arduous paperwork process. “Everyone involved in this case except consumers who were fraudulently billed benefits from this settlement,” the FTC wrote. “Verizon obtains a beneficial release regardless of whether it pays a penny in claims, those who fraudulently billed consumers walk away with their ill-gotten gains and at least partial immunity from making their victims whole, and the plaintiffs’ attorneys receive millions of dollars.” Customers who are unaware of the settlement may relinquish their ability to pursue claims in the future, potentially limiting the FTC’s ability to take further action against the practice, according to the brief. John Jacobs, one of the lead plaintiffs’ attorneys, called the brief “really disappointing.” Jacobs said the settlement installed new protections for consumers and Verizon put an end to cramming within 45 days of settling the lawsuit. He said if customers chose to participate in the settlement, “people are going to get 100 cents on the dollar. I’ve never seen a settlement like that, period.” Verizon spokesman William Kula said the company agrees with retired judge Daniel Weinstein, the mediator on the case, who previously called it an “excellent settlement that provides substantial monetary benefits to the class.” The case is Moore et al. v. Verizon Communications Inc. et al., U.S. District Court of the Northern District of California, No. 09-1823.",8202012,http://www.reuters.com/article/verizon-cramming-ftc/us-consumer-agency-opposes-cramming-phone-fees-settlement-idUSL2E8JKIR120120820

307,VZ,US FCC suspends flexible pricing on coveted broadband lines,"* FCC says special access rules are not working * Agency votes 3-2 to temporarily suspend rules * Will initiate mandatory data request * Verizon, AT&T; say suspension premature By Jasmin Melvin WASHINGTON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - U.S. regulators have temporarily suspended pricing flexibility rules for high-capacity broadband lines, raising hopes for companies that say Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T; Inc have overcharged them billions of dollars for access to the lines in recent years. High-capacity, “special access” lines securely send large quantities of data to networks every time you send an email, withdraw money from an ATM, make a wireless call or even swipe a credit card. Though widely used, ownership of the lines lies largely in the hands of just a few large telephone companies, prompting 1999 rules from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission that regulate the price charged for using the lines. The agency said its mechanism for gauging competition to grant petitions for pricing flexibility in the special access market is inaccurate, and it would not consider future petitions until more data is available to remedy the flawed system. The decision comes after years of complaints from telecommunications companies that rent private, special access lines for services such as connecting their wireless broadcast towers to the Internet. Special access lines are also used by hospitals, government agencies as well as corporations. “This action will at least prevent these continually rising, now exorbitant prices, from rising even further while the Commission evaluates this market failure,” said Maura Corbett, executive director of the NoChokePoints coalition, which represents entities that rely on special access lines, including Sprint Nextel Corp, Clearwire Corp and US Cellular Corp. The FCC said in an order released late Wednesday that it would initiate a mandatory data request within 60 days to help it better understand the competitive landscape of the special access market, worth about $12 billion annually, before deciding how to revamp its pricing rules. Verizon and AT&T; both welcomed the data request but said the suspension of the rules was premature. “While today’s Order acknowledges that the current rules fail to capture the full extent of existing competition, the FCC, before taking any action, should have collected the data it repeatedly has said it needs to evaluate the marketplace,” said Donna Epps, Verizon’s vice president for federal regulatory affairs. Bob Quinn, AT&T;’s senior vice president for federal regulation, argued against what he saw as a move “to further regulate yesterday’s technology” as the industry is shifting from special access to faster fiber-based IP networks. The temporary suspension was decided in a 3-2 vote of the FCC last week, but made public on Wednesday. Republicans commissioners balked at what they also saw as jumping the gun. “The majority chose to lay its procedural path backwards. Due to such glaring deficiencies, I have no choice but to respectfully cast a dissenting vote,” Republican Commissioner Robert McDowell said in a statement. “In short, the Commission has reversed the steps that a data-driven agency should take,” fellow Republican Commissioner Ajit Pai said. The suspension will not affect pricing arrangements already in effect. The agency said it has approved six requests for pricing flexibility since 2008.",8232012,http://www.reuters.com/article/fcc-wireless-lines/us-fcc-suspends-flexible-pricing-on-coveted-broadband-lines-idUSL2E8JNA0620120823
308,VZ,JP Morgan raises TiVo to overweight,"Sept 4 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Securities raised TiVo Inc  to “overweight,” citing strong subscriber growth and expectations of a favorable outcome for its patent dispute with Verizon Communications Inc next month. TiVo’s shares rose 5 percent in morning trade on Tuesday on the Nasdaq. TiVo, which sells set-top boxes and licenses its digital video recording (DVR) technology to cable operators, reported better-than-expected second-quarter results last week on higher sales of its video recorders. The number of TiVo subscriptions across the globe grew 41 percent year-over-year during the quarter, led by growth at Virgin Media Inc. The company is adding customers like cable operators Com Hem in Scandinavia and GCI in Alaska, and is poised for higher adoption for its technology at ONO in Spain, Charter and ComCast Corp, analyst Paul Coster wrote in a note, raising his rating on TiVo stock from “neutral.” TiVo’s advanced TV solutions, which integrate broadcast programming, video on demand and internet video with interactive ad content, appeal to smaller cable operators that need to defend against encroachment by new home entertainment rivals like Google and Apple Inc, Coster said. TiVo owns hundreds of patents and regularly sues other companies. A good chunk of its revenue comes from litigation settlements. It had earlier this year reached a patent-related settlement with Verizon’s rival AT&T; Inc under which the mobile service provider agreed to pay TiVo a minimum of $215 million and monthly licensing fees. The trial in the Verizon case is scheduled to begin on Oct. 1. “We believe a Verizon settlement in excess of $200 million is possible but if this case goes to trial potential outcomes range from zero through multiples of $200 million,” he said. Billionaire Charlie Ergen-led Dish Network Corp and EchoStar Corp also agreed to pay TiVo $500 million to settle a patent dispute in May. TiVo also licenses its digital video recording technology to DirecTV, RCN and Suddenlink.",9042012,http://www.reuters.com/article/tivo-research-jpmorgan/jp-morgan-raises-tivo-to-overweight-idUSL4E8K43Q620120904
309,VZ,Verizon CEO: Samsung may be factor in mobile software war,"NEW YORK, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics  may become a surprise factor in the battle for dominance of the smartphone software market, Lowell McAdam, chief executive of Verizon Communications, said on Friday. Google Inc’s Android and Apple Inc’s iOS operating systems currently dominate the smartphone market. But Verizon Wireless, the mobile venture of Verizon, has made no secret of the fact it wants to see a strong third competitor. The biggest U.S. mobile operator has already said it will sell phones based on Microsoft Corp’s Windows Phone 8 software later this year to support a third system. Another contender, Research In Motion, has fallen on hard times and will miss out on 2012 holiday sales as it has delayed its next BlackBerry system until next year. Verizon has also said it wants to sell the next BlackBerry phones when they are ready in early 2013. Verizon’s McAdam said it was too soon to count RIM out of the game and that it was not yet clear which system will win third place going forward. McAdam said he also expects competition from Samsung, which focuses mostly on selling phones using the Android operating system, after it was recently dealt a bruising defeat in Apple’s patent infringement court case against it in California. “The dark horse here might be Samsung,” McAdam said during a webcast of an investor call. “They’ve got the capability to go out on their own to do their own operating system. They’ve tinkered with it.” Samsung has developed a mobile operating system called Bada, which it uses for lower-end devices. It uses Android software for its top of the range devices. However, Charter Equity Research analyst Ed Snyder was skeptical Samsung has a strong Android/iOS rival in the works. “What (McAdam is) trying to do is stoke the competition,” Snyder said.",9072012,http://www.reuters.com/article/verizon-samsung/verizon-ceo-samsung-may-be-factor-in-mobile-software-war-idUSL2E8K7AGK20120907

311,VZ,Verizon to pay more than $250 million in TiVo settlement,"(Reuters) - TiVo Inc will receive at least $250.4 million from Verizon Communications Inc as part of a patent litigation settlement, the video recorder pioneer said on Monday, sending its shares up more than 4 percent. TiVo, whose brand is synonymous with digital video recorders, has had to turn to litigation to generate revenue from licensing fees as it struggles to fight competition from low-cost rivals. Analysts said the Verizon settlement could bode well for a TiVo victory in cases against other companies, including Time Warner Cable Inc and Motorola Mobility, which is now owned by Google Inc. The settlement, a big victory for TiVo, follows a similar deal it reached in January with AT&T; Inc, which agreed to pay $215 million. TiVo had also prevailed in a similar case against Dish Network Corp and EchoStar Corp in May 2011. Regarding the ongoing cases, “Verizon has set a strong precedent for Motorola to settle,” Brean Murray analyst Todd Mitchell said. TiVo had sued Time Warner Cable in a lawsuit connected with the Motorola litigation, and Monday’s settlement only improves the company’s position, according to Lazard Capital Markets analyst Barton Crockett. “It also potentially sets the stage for a similar settlement with Time Warner Cable over the next year or so,” Crockett said. Time Warner Cable declined to comment on Monday. Motorola Mobility was not immediately available for comment. TiVo said Verizon would initially pay $100 million in cash and recurring quarterly payments totaling $150.4 million through July 2018. As part of the deal, the companies are discussing having TiVo boxes carry the new Internet video streaming service Verizon is developing with Coinstar Inc’s Redbox to take on Netflix Inc. TiVo’s DVRs already feature video services provided by Netflix and Amazon.com Inc. Besides the guaranteed compensation, Verizon will pay TiVo license fees on a monthly basis through July 2018 for each Verizon DVR subscriber above a certain agreed-upon number. If Verizon and TiVo pursue “certain commercial initiatives” by December 21, up to $29.4 million of the payments made by Verizon would be subject to a credit of an equal amount, TiVo said. This probably refers to a nonexclusive deal for Verizon to offer TiVo boxes to customers, according to Mitchell, the Brean Murray analyst. Verizon declined comment on the settlement or future agreements, and it referred questions to TiVo. The companies also agreed to dismiss all pending litigation between them.

The transaction affects U.S. management pension benefits covering about 41,000 current management retirees, Verizon said in a statement on Wednesday. “It’s prudent business for us,” said Verizon spokesman Ray McConville, adding that it allowed the company to focus on its business rather than managing a fund. “Interest rates will remain low into 2015,” he said. “We don’t have to be interest rate speculators.” Verizon said it would add $2.5 billion to the pension plan, including contributions made in September, so that the plan’s funding level does not decline. The company declined to comment on how much of a premium it was paying, saying it would disclose more details when it reports earnings Thursday. Also known as pension terminal funding, the concept of the deal is simple: an employer pays an upfront premium to an insurance company for an annuity that covers the members of a pension plan. The insurer becomes responsible, via the annuity, for all of the retirees’ pensions and the sponsor gets to wash its hands of the obligation. Shares in Verizon held steady in after-hours trade on Wednesday at $44.72.

319,VZ,"Wireless boosts Verizon's third-quarter profit, mum on 2013","(Reuters) - U.S. telecommunications group Verizon Communications Inc posted a record quarterly profit thanks to its wireless business, even as corporate customers delayed renewing contracts amid continued economic uncertainty at home and abroad. Verizon said on Thursday it was on track to meet 2012 financial goals, with capital spending for the year expected to be lower than the $16.2 billion total in 2011. Like rivals AT&T; Inc and Sprint Nextel Corp, Verizon Wireless is spending billions of dollars to upgrade its network to support booming demand for services like web surfing and video on smartphones like Apple Inc’s iPhone. Higher data usage can translate into better profits. “Wireless achieved record profitability in a quarter in which we reported the highest number of retail postpaid gross and net adds in four years,” Chief Executive Lowell McAdam said in a statement, referring to new customer numbers. For the third quarter, Verizon’s profit rose to $1.59 billion, or 56 cents per share, from $1.37 billion, or 49 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter, when the firm was hit with costs from a two-week workers’ strike and weather damage. Revenue increased to $29.01 billion from $27.91 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts, on average, expected revenue of $28.96 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding unusual items, the company earned 64 cents per share, in line with expectations. Shares rose 3.6 percent to $46.33 near midday. Macquarie Capital analyst Kevin Smithen said in a note that Verizon was “the undisputed champion of US wireless and perhaps global wireless.” Its Verizon Wireless venture with Vodafone Group Plc added 1.8 million net new subscribers in the quarter, compared with 882,000 in the year-ago third quarter. Verizon Wireless, the No. 1 U.S. mobile provider, posted a 7.5 percent increase in quarterly service revenue to $16.2 billion. Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo did not comment on prospects for 2013, except to say the company anticipated improved profitability in its wireline business and that he hoped large businesses would “renew their investing activities in 2013.” Chief investment officers have been holding off on new contracts and investment decisions, remaining cautious “with regard to uncertainties involving the election outcome, the pending fiscal cliff, potential tax reform and other policy changes that may take place,” Shammo said on a call with analysts. He added that the situation in Europe was particularly challenging for enterprise and wholesale revenues and that the economic pressures there would also be felt in 2013. “Unfortunately we don’t see anything different than we see today,” Shammo said. Overall, Verizon’s wireline revenue declined 2.3 percent to $9.9 billion, broadly in line with expectations. However, its consumer wireline business grew 4.6 percent to $3.6 billion. At the end of the third quarter, smartphones constituted more than 53 percent of the Verizon Wireless customers who are billed monthly, up from 50 percent at the end of second quarter of 2012, the company said. On June 28, Verizon overhauled its price structure to allow families and individuals to share a data allowance among multiple devices. As part of its new plans, it raised fees for data services like mobile web surfing while offering unlimited calls and texts for a flat fee. The idea of the new plans was to encourage customers to connect more devices, including tablet computers to its cellular network. As a result, Verizon Wireless now reports average revenue per account (ARPA) instead of average revenue per user (ARPU) since customers can share data among multiple devices. Verizon said by the end of the quarter it had 34.8 million accounts billed on a monthly basis, compared with 34.6 million in the second quarter. Average revenue per account rose 6.5 percent to $145.42 from $143.32 in the second quarter and $136.57 in the third quarter the year before. About 35 percent of an estimated 1.9 billion cellphones that are sold worldwide this year will be smartphones. Between 20 percent and 25 percent of people in the world already own smartphones, with the penetration rate rising to a range of 50 percent to 55 percent in the United States, according to research firm Gartner. Macquarie’s Smithen added that Verizon had nothing to fear from Sprint and Japan’s Softbank Corp because the two would not be able to be disruptive until at least the second quarter of 2014. Sprint last week agreed to sell 70 percent of itself to Softbank in a $20 billion transaction. Shammo said the move by Softbank was evidence of the strength of the U.S. market and “the growth potential that is still available within this market.” ",10182012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-verizoncommunications-results/wireless-boosts-verizons-third-quarter-profit-mum-on-2013-idUSBRE89H0BD20121018

323,VZ,TEXT-Fitch says Verizon's pension strategy a long-term positive,"Oct 19 - Fitch Ratings believes Verizon Communications Inc.’s (Verizon) plans to transfer the existing pension obligations of its management retirees to Prudential Insurance Company of America (Prudential; long-term Issuer Default Rating of ‘A’, Issuer Financial Strength rating of ‘A+’, Stable Outlook) through the purchase of a group annuity contract has an incremental positive impact on the company’s credit profile. The transfer is a significant step to reduce future cash contributions to the company’s pension plans. Fitch’s IDR on Verizon is ‘A’ and the Rating Outlook is Stable.  To enact the plan, the Verizon Management Pension Plan will transfer an  undisclosed level of assets to Prudential which will be used to purchase a group annuity contract. Under the contract, Prudential irrevocably assumes the  responsibility to pay the pension benefits of approximately 41,000 management  retirees that had retired prior to Jan. 1, 2010. Following the purchase of the  contract, Verizon will have no further obligations for the pension benefits of  this set of retirees. The purchase of the group annuity contract is expected to  take place in December 2012, and is subject to modest adjustments. Prudential  will be responsible for benefit payments to management retirees beginning in  January 2013.   The transfer of the management retiree obligations will reduce the projected  benefit obligation (PBO) of Verizon’s pension plans by approximately $7.5  billion on a GAAP basis, or 25% of total pension liabilities. At the end of  2011, the PBO associated with all of Verizon’s pension plans was $30.6 billion,  and, based on underfunding of $6.5 billion, Verizon’s plans were approximately  79% funded.   Verizon plans to contribute $3.4 billion to its pension plans in 2012, $2.1  billion higher than the company estimated at the beginning of 2012. Through the  first nine months of 2012, Verizon contributed $1.8 billion to its pension plans and expects to contribute $1.6 billion to the plans during the fourth quarter of 2012. The additional contribution will be made prior to the closing of the  transaction so that the transaction does not decrease the funding percentage of  the remaining plans.    Incorporated into the transfer of obligations is an undisclosed premium. Fitch  believes the premium is reasonable, given Verizon will be able to avoid certain  administrative costs in the future and premiums paid to the Pension Benefit  Guaranty Corporation (PBGC).  In Fitch’s opinion, Verizon has sufficient liquidity to fund the higher  contributions in 2012, and as a result, the contribution will have an immaterial effect on Fitch’s expected 1.3x leverage metric for yearend 2012. Based on  Verizon’s statements that there will no longer be required contributions in 2013 under its revised pension strategy, Fitch believes there will be no changes to  Fitch’s 2013 expected debt levels for Verizon, and that the company will be able to operate within Fitch’s expected 2013 leverage range of 1.3x-1.4x for its  current rating.",10192012,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWNA802220121019
324,VZ,Hurricane Sandy disrupts Northeast U.S. telecom networks,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Power outages and flooding caused by Hurricane Sandy disrupted telecommunications services in Northeastern states on Tuesday, resulting in spotty coverage for cellphones, television, home telephones and Internet services. While all the region’s telecom service providers were having problems, Verizon Communications, which serves many of the states in the hurricane’s path, may have suffered some of the worst damage from the storm to its wireline network. About 25 percent of the region’s wireless cell towers were out of action after the storm and some 911 emergency call centers were not working, according to Julius Genachowski, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. “Our assumption is that communications outages could get worse before they get better,” Genachowski told reporters on a conference call, noting that the storm had not ended. Also power outages could disrupt more cell sites if they run out of back-up power before commercial electricity services are up and running again. People lined up at pay-phones in at least one New York neighborhood, the Lower East Side, today as their phones had either lost coverage or they had run out of battery power because there was nowhere to charge their phones in the neighborhood which had lost commercial power. New York-based Verizon said the storm caused flooding at three Verizon central offices that hold telecom equipment in Lower Manhattan as well as sites in Queens and Long Island. Its downtown headquarters, which was put out of action 11 years ago by the September 11 attacks, had three feet of water in the lobby at one point. Because of flooding, all its telecom equipment at that office, which serves much of Wall Street and downtown consumers, was knocked out of service. The company said it was working on pumping out the water in the hope that it could restart its back-up power generators in the facility as commercial power services were not yet restored the morning after the big storm hit. “The bullseye of the impact is the metro area,” said spokesman William Kula, adding that restoring service for the city’s financial district was a top priority for Verizon. Telecom disruptions affect electronic trading as well as corporate operators. The chief operating officer of the New York Stock Exchange, which is expected to open Wednesday, said “lots of telecom infrastructure is down” and that the NYSE was working with big firms to ensure they were doing testing of their systems. Verizon did not give an estimate as to how many businesses and consumers were affected. Two of three Manhattan central offices were partially flooded and operating minimal services. Customers served by the damaged central offices will experience “a loss of all services” including TV, Internet, and traditional telephone services, Kula said. Some customers may experience intermittent busy signals for non-emergency calls. Verizon said its engineers were working on assessing the damage from the early hours. Outside of New York, the company warned that it was also having some trouble. “Verizon is discovering that many poles and power lines/Verizon cables are down throughout the region due to heavy winds and falling trees,” the company said in a statement. Verizon Wireless, AT&T; Inc, Sprint Nextel, and T-Mobile USA said they were dealing with wireless service problems in the hurricane region. Cable operators Cablevision Systems Corp, Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable also said they were having service problems. “I think everybody’s equipment’s going to be damaged, including cellphone towers,” Stifel Nicolaus analyst Christopher King said from his Verizon Wireless cellphone in Baltimore. “Particularly for Verizon, they’re clearly going to have the most damage on the wireline side because its pretty much all of their territory (where the storm hit),” King said. Sprint Nextel, the No. 3 U.S. mobile provider said it was seeing outages at some cell sites because of the power outages across all the states in Sandy’s path including New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Washington DC, Maryland, North Virginia and New England. “(Repair crews) have started on some critical areas but they haven’t been able to get to everywhere they need to be,” spokeswoman Crystal Davis said. She noted that 80 of the company’s stores would reopen at noon. Sprint had closed about 180 stores ahead of the storm. T-Mobile USA said that “customers may be experiencing service disruptions or an inability to access service in some areas, especially those that were hardest hit by the storm.” People complained of outages to their cable telephone, Internet and television services from providers including Comcast, Cablevision and Verizon in New Jersey, Connecticut, and New York. Cablevision said it was experiencing widespread service interruptions primarily related to loss of power. The company said it is working to restore services. Comcast, whose headquarters is in Philadelphia and serves East Coast states, said that for the majority of customers, “Comcast service should be restored as power comes back on to their homes.” Cellphone service was spotty for top wireless providers Verizon Wireless, AT&T; Inc and T-Mobile USA, a unit of Deutsche Telekom, according to some customers. Verizon Wireless, a venture of Verizon Communications and Vodafone Group, said on Tuesday afternoon that customers may be experiencing service issues and that about 94 percent of its cell sites were up and running. AT&T; said it was experiencing some issues in areas heavily affected by the storm. By Tuesday morning, spokesman Mark Siegel said AT&T; was in the initial stages of on-the-ground assessment and that it expected “crews will be working around the clock to restore service.” Several Time Warner Cable customers in Brooklyn said that their Internet, television and phone services stopped working Monday night but were back again by Tuesday morning. Time Warner Cable said that while it has not seen any major damage to its infrastructure, its customers who do not have electricity do not have cable services. Millions of people in the eastern United States awoke on Tuesday to flooded homes, fallen trees and widespread power outages caused by Sandy, which swamped New York City’s subway system and submerged streets in Manhattan’s financial district. At least 30 people were reported killed in the United States by one of the biggest storms to ever hit the country. Sandy dropped just below hurricane status before making landfall on Monday night in New Jersey.

The storm could end up costing cable and telephone network operators $550 million to $600 million in clean-up and repair costs, according to Barclays analyst James Ratcliffe. Along with Cablevision and Verizon, Ratcliffe also included costs at Time Warner Cable and the wireless operations of AT&T; Inc and Sprint Nextel in his estimate. New York-based Verizon has been struggling to restart its services in parts of New York due to flooding and power outages in Lower Manhattan, Queens and Long Island after Sandy hit the U.S. Northeast on Monday night. Verizon was still trying to pump out water from its central offices in lower Manhattan on Thursday. An executive said it could take Verizon two weeks to restore services to all its customers. The company is using tens of thousands of gallons of fuel per day to power repair trucks and backup generators in areas where electricity is out. And with reports of fuel shortages in the hurricane zone, “there’s a decent amount of competition” to procure diesel for the generators, he said. Many Verizon employees involved in the recovery are scheduled to work 12-hour days seven days a week to fix the network, up from their typical 40 hour week, he said. Ratcliffe estimated that Sandy would cost Verizon about $306 million, compared with his estimate for $180 million in costs from Hurricane Irene, which hit the New York region in 2011. “The damage is worse and downtown Manhattan is a huge hub of network infrastructure,” Ratcliffe said. In the third quarter of 2011, Verizon booked a charge of $250 million or 5 cents per share as a result of Hurricane Irene and a two-week strike by about half its wireline workers. Evercore analyst Jonathan Schildkraut estimated that most of that charge was related to Irene. “I’d imagine this is significantly worse,” he said referring to costs from Sandy. Verizon reported a profit of $1.59 billion, or 56 cents per share in the third quarter of 2012. Barclay’s Ratcliffe estimated that Cablevision would be set back about $36 million by Sandy. This would represent more than 6 percent of his expectation for fourth-quarter earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Damage from Irene cost Cablevision about $16 million. In comparison the costs will represent just 3 percent of Verizon’s EBITDA, Ratcliffe said. Cablevision will have “the biggest impact relative to its size” according to the analyst. Cablevision said on Thursday that roughly half its 3.3 million customers were without power and some customers who had electric power still had no cable service. After the outage, analysts including Michael McCormack at Nomura worried whether Cablevision would be able to raise its prices for customers this year, as is expected by many analysts. Wireless operators are also struggling to restore services to their customers as cellphone towers were knocked off line by power outages and flooding. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission said on Thursday that about 19 percent of towers were still offline that morning down from 25 percent the day after the storm. Verizon Wireless, a venture of Verizon Communications and Vodafone Group Plc, said on Thursday that about 96 percent of their cellsite were up an running, up from 94 percent the day before. Sprint, the No. 3 U.S. operator said that more than 80 percent of its network was operating by Thursday evening. T-Mobile USA, a unit of Deutsche Telekom, said it had completed 85 percent of its restoration in New York by Thursday evening. However it is only 80 percent complete in Staten Island, a borough of New York. AT&T; and T-Mobile USA on Wednesday agreed to open their networks to each other’s customers in a roaming deal to help provide their customers service more quickly after the storm. Nomura’s McCormack said that operator costs from Sandy could be twice or three times the costs from Irene, but even then he said the telecom and cable companies are big enough to absorb the extra expenses without hurting valuations. “Right now the only concerns I’ve heard from investors is whether this will be a distraction from the ongoing business,” McCormack said.",11012012,http://www.reuters.com/article/storm-sandy-telecoms/sandy-seen-costing-telco-cable-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-idUSL1E8M1L9Z20121101
331,VZ,UPDATE 1-Verizon may need two weeks to restore some services,"By Sinead Carew NEW YORK, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications  may take up to two weeks to restore telecommunication services for some of its customers after flooding and power outages knocked out services during massive storm Sandy, according to a top executive for the company. The provider of telephone, Internet and television services said while some customers already have service and others will have service in a matter of days, it will take as long as two weeks for some other customers. On Thursday Verizon was still working on pumping water out of central offices with key telecom equipment in order to restore its services, Tom Maguire, senior vice president for national operations support, told Reuters. Verizon is using tens of thousands of gallons of fuel every day in back-up generators powering telecom equipment and in vehicles that are working in affected areas But despite a retail fuel crisis in the New York area, Maguire said he is “pretty confident” Verizon will have enough fuel because it is working with the government and fuel suppliers on procurement. “There’s a decent amount of competition” for fuel, Maguire said. Even taxis were turning away customers on Thursday as drivers had to spend hours searching for gas. {ID:nL1E8M139K] While telecom equipment was back up and running Verizon’s main New York office on 140 West Street in lower Manhattan, Maguire said the company was still struggling to return services from another location at the tip of the island.",11012012,http://www.reuters.com/article/storm-sandy-verizon/update-1-verizon-may-need-two-weeks-to-restore-some-services-idUSL1E8M1L4D20121101

335,VZ,TEXT- Fitch rates Verizon Communications proposed debt issue 'A',"Nov 2 - Fitch Ratings has assigned an ‘A’ rating to Verizon Communications, Inc.’s  (Verizon) (NYSE: VZ) proposed three tranche offering of $4.5 billion of senior unsecured notes. The proceeds will be used to retire prior to maturity all or a portion of $1.75 billion of debt due in 2013, $2 billion of debt due in 2018 and to fund a tender offer, contingent upon completing the offering, for any or all of the $1.25 billion 8.95% senior unsecured notes due in 2039. Remaining proceeds may be used for general corporate purposes. The Rating Outlook is Stable.  VZ’s ratings are supported by strong free cash flows (FCF) which, in turn,  provide the company flexibility with respect to operating within its target  leverage range of 1.3 times (x)-1.4x. This leverage range is conservative  relative to Fitch’s expectations of around 1.5x for the category. Additional  supporting factors include the significant scale and scope of the company’s  domestic wireline and wireless businesses and the high proportion of revenues  from wireless and wireline growth areas.  An important component of VZ’s ratings is the expectation for continued relatively strong growth in Verizon Wireless’  (VZW) revenue, EBITDA, and FCF. In the first nine months of 2012, the domestic  wireless segment produced approximately 65% of total consolidated revenues.    Gross leverage for the last 12 months (LTM) ending Sept. 30, 2012 was 1.4x.   Consolidated cash balances declined from $13.4 billion at the end of 2011 to  $9.7 billion at Sept. 30, 2012 as VZW paid a $10 billion dividend in January, of which $4.5 billion was to VZW’s 45% owner, Vodafone Group Plc. The support for  the distribution is provided by VZW’s strong FCF generation.  Over the LTM  ending Sept. 30, 2012, VZW’s simple FCF (EBITDA less capital spending) was  approximately $21.5 billion.   The ratings also incorporate Verizon’s recently disclosed plans to contribute  $3.4 billion to its pension plans in 2012, $2.1 billion higher than the company  estimated at the beginning of 2012. The new 2012 contribution amount funds the  transfer of the company’s management pension plan to Prudential Insurance  Company of America as well as maintains the existing funding percentage with the pension plans that remain the obligation of Verizon. Through the first nine  months of 2012, Verizon contributed $1.8 billion to its pension plans and  expects to contribute $1.6 billion to the plans during the fourth quarter of  2012.  Concerns include the ongoing competitive pressures in the residential wireline  market from wireless substitution and cable telephony competition, and the  effect of the slow economic recovery on revenues from business and residential  customers.   There is event risk regarding VZ’s potential acquisition of Vodafone 45%  interest in VZW, as there would be concerns with regard to its initial outlay  and financing. At the current time, the companies are strongly committed to the  partnership, particularly given the distribution in early 2012 and expected  strong cash flows that would support potential future distributions.    At Sept. 30, 2012, VZ had $52.8 billion in debt on a consolidated basis.  Of  this amount, $6.3 billion matures within one year, or $4.3 billion pro forma for the make-whole call. VZ’s commercial paper (CP) issuances approximated $2.3  billion and are backed by a $6.2 billion credit facility, and Fitch expects the  company to maintain aggregate CP balances within a level fully backed by the  facility. The credit facility has no ratings triggers or other restrictive  covenants, such as leverage or interest coverage tests. The three-year facility  matures in August 2016. After the effect of letters of credit (LOCs),  approximately $6.1 billion is available on the facility. On a consolidated  basis, VZ and its subsidiaries have scheduled debt maturities of approximately  $100 million and $5.4 billion in 2012 and 2013, respectively.  In the LTM ending Sept. 30, 2012, FCF after dividends and capital spending (but  prior to the VZW distribution to Vodafone) was approximately $12.7 billion. In  2012, Fitch expects VZ’s FCF (after capital spending, pension contributions and  dividends but prior to distributions to Vodafone and the acquisition of wireless spectrum) to be in a $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion range, an increase from the  $8 billion generated in 2011. Fitch believes that as FCF continues to grow, and  in the absence of other investment alternatives, the company will have the  flexibility to consider stock repurchases within the context of maintaining  leverage within its 1.3x-1.4x target range.    In 2012, Fitch expects consolidated capital spending to be down slightly  relative to 2011 levels, when spending totaled approximately $16.2 billion. VZ  has not provided capital spending guidance by business segment for 2012. In  2012, key areas of capital spending will consist of the continued buildout of  advanced networks, including the 4G wireless network and FiOS, well as core  network spending on IP and data center enhancements.    What Could Trigger A Rating Action  A positive rating action could occur if:  —Fitch believes a positive rating action is unlikely, given the industry’s  business and technological risks.  A negative rating action could occur if:  —The rating could be negatively affected by heightened wireless competition.  Fitch believes there is a relatively low probability that VZW’s competitive  position will become weaker than the wireless industry as a whole.",11022012,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWNA879220121102

340,VZ,UPDATE 6-AT&T; to boost annual spending 16 pct to $22 bln,"* More investment needed to compete with Verizon * Sees tapping debt markets, raising debt-to-EBITDA ratio * Plans LTE expansion to cover 300 mln people by end 2014 * Sees mid-single digit pct range EPS growth in next 3 years * AT&T; shares fall more than 3 pct   (Adds analyst comment on chipmakers, paragraph 30) By Sinead Carew Nov 7 (Reuters) - AT&T; Inc will boost capital spending by about 16 percent to $22 billion a year for the next three years to upgrade its wireless and wireline networks, the company said on Wednesday. Its shares fell more than 3 percent after the news. Rival Verizon Communications Inc is ahead in high-speed mobile services, and AT&T; also must improve rural phone lines, comprised of outdated copper technology. The company said it hopes the investments will boost revenue growth by allowing it to chase new opportunities such as adding wireless connections to cars and home security. AT&T; said upgrading its wireline network was more attractive than carving off the business or divesting parts of the network. Previously, it said it was considering selling some rural phone lines. “This gives us the opportunity to improve our top-line growth and change our cost structure,” Chief Executive Randall Stephenson told analysts at an AT&T; event in New York. Investors worried about the spending hike from AT&T;’s 2012 capital budget for $19 billion to $20 billion, although the company vowed to come in at the low end of the range this year. “It’s a big number and it’s not just for one year,” Hudson Square Research analyst Todd Rethemeier said. Verizon Communications has sold off many hard-to-reach rural phone lines. AT&T; was forced into the upgrade option because it could not find a buyer, Rethemeier said. “They’re doing it because they really have to do it,” said New Street Research analyst Jonathan Chaplin, adding that “the pay-off is unclear.” AT&T; said the investment would lead to revenue growth 100 basis points above the U.S. gross domestic product, supporting earnings per share growth in the mid-single-digit percentage range for the next three years. But Chaplin was unimpressed with the growth targets. “It looks like a giant boost of spending for the results we thought (they’d produce) all along,” he said. AT&T; shares were down $1.18 or 3 percent at $33.62 on the New York Stock Exchange after the news. The S&P; 500 stock index was down 2 percent. THREE-YEAR PLAN The three-year spending plan includes a budget of $8 billion for expanding the wireless network and $6 billion for upgrading the wireline network, the company said. It said this will boost capital expenses to the high end of its target for spending in the mid-teen percentage range of revenue for the next two years, with spending returning to normal levels in 2015. Executives said AT&T;’s business customers are nervous about spending due to the weak economy and the looming U.S. “fiscal cliff” under which the White House and lawmakers have two months to agree on a plan to shrink the federal budget. Failure to meet the self-imposed deadline will trigger $600 billion in spending cuts and higher taxes beginning in January. A day after President Barack Obama was re-elected, AT&T; CEO Stephenson said he hopes the government will focus on resolving the fiscal cliff. He told analysts the uncertainty is creating “a real throttle on this country’s growth now.” Stephenson told Reuters he hoped Obama’s re-election “will be a positive and get us going forward on this fiscal cliff.” AT&T; plans to tap debt markets to take advantage of historically low interest rates. It expects its ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization to rise to about 1.8 over the next two years from 1.42 at the end of the third quarter. Chaplin said he expects AT&T; will partially offset steeper spending by using additional financing to buy back shares. The company also said it would raise its quarterly dividend to 45 cents per share from 44 cents. AT&T; said it would upgrade its wireline network with fiber to reach another 1 million business customers and provide high-speed Internet service to 75 percent of wireline customer locations. It will expand its U-verse services, which include high-speed Internet and television, by a third to cover 43 percent of its network by the end of 2015. The wireline upgrade plans should benefit AT&T;’s main equipment vendor Alcatel-Lucent, and to a lesser extent Juniper Networks Inc, Cisco Systems Inc , Adtran Inc and Ciena Corp, Morgan Stanley analyst Ehud Gelblum said in a research note. AT&T; also plans to expand its high-speed wireless network based on the Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard to cover 300 million people, or most of the country, by the end of 2014. Its previously planned coverage of 250 million people by the end of 2013. Bigger rival Verizon Wireless, a venture of Verizon and Vodafone Group Plc, says it will have upgraded its entire network with LTE by the end of 2013. Ralph de la Vega, the head of AT&T;’s wireless business, said the company’s upgrade plan calls for much deeper coverage than its bigger rival. “We might be more conservative in what we call ready than the other guy,” he told Reuters. “If we can do it sooner we will but we’re not going to compromise coverage.” The wireless upgrade should benefit Ericsson and Alcatel Lucent, according to Gelblum. Chipmakers selling components used in telecom infrastructure, including Xilinx, Altera, Texas Instruments, Analog Devices, Freescale , Broadcom and Cavium, also stand to gain from AT&T;’s increased spending, analysts said. AT&T; plans to expand beyond cellphones by offering a wireless home security services next year. It also has deals with automakers for its connected-car initiative, according to de la Vega who declined to provide details. De la Vega said AT&T; aims for these businesses to become $1 billion annual revenue opportunities in two to five years. Stephenson said AT&T; could make small “tuck-in” acquisitions in these new market segments.   (Reporting by Sinead Carew in New York. Additional reporting by Noel Randewich in San Francisco.

343,VZ,Verizon Wireless to pay $8.5 billion dividend to its owners,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Wireless said on Monday that its board agreed to pay a total dividend of $8.5 billion to its two parent companies, Verizon Communications (VZ.N) and Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L). The announcement follows months of investor speculation as to whether Verizon Wireless would pay a dividend this year. Verizon Communications, which owns 55 percent of Verizon Wireless and is dependent on wireless operations for growth, could put the cash toward its capital spending, debt interest or its own shareholder dividends, Barclays analyst James Ratcliffe said. “It’s driven primarily by the cash needs of Verizon Communications,” said Ratcliffe, who had expected a distribution in the range of $10 billion to $12 billion. Verizon declined to comment on the size of the pay-out or how it plans to use the cash. The pay-out is down from the $10 billion dividend that Verizon Wireless announced in July 2011 and paid in January 2012. In the past, the dividend had been a bone of contention for Vodafone shareholders, anxious to get a return on their ownership in the top U.S. wireless service. The dividend had been suspended from 2005 through 2010 while Verizon Wireless focused on paying down debt. Verizon Wireless said the distributions would be paid in one or more tranches, with each tranche paid in proportion to the two owners’ partnership interests. The announcement came the day before Vodafone was due to report its half-year results. The dividends are due to be paid on or before December 31, Verizon Wireless said.

347,VZ,"Verizon CEO says no to Dish spectrum buy, big deals","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications, majority owner of the biggest U.S. mobile service, is not interested in buying spectrum from Dish Network and does not plan to make any big acquisitions, its top executive said on Tuesday. While investors have been speculating that Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen could make a lot of money if he sells Dish’s wireless spectrum holdings to big U.S. mobile operators, Verizon Chief Executive Lowell McAdam told Reuters at an investor conference that his company would not be a buyer. McAdam also told the audience at the UBS Annual Global Media and Communications Conference that his company was not planning any acquisitions as big as its recent purchases of Terremark and Hughes Telematics. Verizon bought enterprise service provider Terremark last year for $1.4 billion and completed its purchase of Hughes for $612 million in July. It may do more deals in the software space but these would be smaller transactions, McAdam told the conference. “It’s in the tens of millions (of dollars) kind of range versus the hundreds of millions kind of range. Right now, I don’t see the value add of a huge acquisition,” McAdam said. He said Verizon Wireless, the company’s venture with Vodafone Group Plc, is seeing strong phone sales so far in the holiday shopping season. The venture’s strong customer growth in the third quarter, when it won market share from rivals, is continuing in the fourth quarter, he said. The executive pointed to retailer estimates of sales volume increases of up to 40 percent on the days after Thanksgiving and said, “We saw that kind of improvement.” He declined to say how many of those phone sales were upgrades by existing customers or sales to new customers. Given the comments, Verizon may be in a position to beat UBS analyst John Hodulik’s expectations for 1.8 million net subscriber additions in the fourth quarter, the analyst said in a research note. McAdam said he would provide an estimate in January for the financial impact of damage to Verizon’s network from Hurricane Sandy, which slammed into the U.S. Northeast on October 29. Verizon expects to replace damaged copper phone lines with fiber in places such as lower Manhattan, which would allow it to provide more advanced services such as high-speed Internet and television to customers there. “Our plan is to take advantage of this disruption,” McAdam said. The executive said the company is currently running trials of its planned Internet video service from a partnership with Coinstar Inc unit Redbox and plans to launch the service commercially around the end of the first quarter. This marks a delay for the service, which Verizon previously expected to launch in the second half of 2012. McAdam also told investors that the company would consider starting a share buyback program in 12 to 18 months, depending on how much cash it spends to upgrade its fiber network or on acquisitions. Verizon shares were down 10 cents at $44.00 in late-morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

349,VZ,"Verizon CEO says no to Dish spectrum deal, big acquisitions","* CEO McAdam sees acquisitions in “tens of millions” range * Would not buy Dish spectrum if it goes on sale * Seeing handset sales volume increase in holidays * Sees launch of internet video service around end Q1 NEW YORK, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications, majority owner of the biggest U.S. mobile service, is not interested in buying spectrum from Dish Network and does not plan to make big acquisitions, its top executive said on Tuesday. While investors have been speculating that Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen could make a lot of money if he sells the company’s wireless spectrum holdings to big U.S. mobile operators, Verizon Chief Executive Lowell McAdam told Reuters at an investor conference that his company would not be a buyer. McAdam also told the audience at the UBS Annual Global Media and Communications Conference that his company is not planning any acquisitions as big as its recent purchases of Terremark and Hughes Telematics. Verizon bought enterprise service provider Terremark last year for $1.4 billion and completed its purchase of Hughes for $612 million in July. It could do more deals in the software space but these would be smaller transactions, McAdam said. “It’s in the tens of millions kinds of range versus the hundreds of millions kind of range. Right now I don’t see the value add of a huge acquisition,” McAdam told the conference on Tuesday. McAdam said Verizon Wireless, the company’s venture with Vodafone Group Plc, is seeing strong phone sales in the holiday shopping season that started at the end of November. He pointed to retailer estimates of sales volumes increases of up to 40 percent on the days after Thanksgiving and said “we saw that kind of improvement.” However, he declined to say how many of those phone sales were upgrades by existing customers or sales to new customers. The executive said he would provide an estimate in January for the financial impact of damage to its network due to hurricane Sandy which hit the U.S. Northeast in late October. As a result of the storm, Verizon expects to replace damaged copper phone lines with fiber in places such as lower Manhattan, which would allow it to provide more advanced services such as high-speed Internet and television to customers there. “Our plan is to take advantage of this disruption,” the executive told investors. The executive said that the company is currently running trials of its planned Internet video service from a partnership with Coinstar Inc unit Redbox and plans to launch the service commercially around the end of the first quarter.

351,VZ,Judge denies bid to block Verizon's $7.5 billion pension transfer,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge in Texas on Friday denied Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) retirees’ attempt to stop the company from transferring $7.5 billion in pension obligations to insurer Prudential Insurance Co of America. The ruling from U.S. District Judge Sidney Fitzwater clears the way for Verizon to proceed with the move, first announced in October, in which Verizon would purchase a group annuity contract where Prudential would be responsible for paying retirees’ pensions. The transfer is scheduled to close December 10. On November 27, two management retirees affected by the move filed a lawsuit in Texas federal court, seeking a court order blocking the transfer. They argued in court filings that the move would strip them and approximately 41,000 other affected employees of their federal legal protections and interfere with their rights under the retirement plan. Fitzwater rejected their request for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. He wrote in a 15-page ruling that “plaintiffs have failed to carry their burden of showing a substantial likelihood of success on the merits.” A lawyer for the plaintiffs, Curtis Kennedy, said that the retirees “should have been allowed a voice and a choice with respect to the planned change.” He said the plaintiffs are considering an appeal. A Verizon spokesman said the company was pleased with the decision. A spokeswoman for Prudential declined to comment. Also known as pension terminal funding, the concept of the deal is simple: an employer pays an upfront premium to an insurance company for an annuity that covers the members of a pension plan. The insurer becomes responsible, via the annuity, for all of the retirees’ pensions and the sponsor gets to wash its hands of the obligation. General Motors Co completed a similar deal with Prudential earlier this year. The case is Lee et al. V.

353,VZ,Netflix rival Redbox starts movie streaming this month,"(Reuters) - Kiosk operator Redbox will launch an instant video streaming service that starts at $6 a month, providing another challenge to dominant movie rental company Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) in the battle for home entertainment dollars. The price for online movies from Redbox and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) is lower than the $8 monthly fee charged by Netflix for unlimited viewing from its larger online library of films and TV shows. “Redbox Instant by Verizon” will start selling subscriptions through a limited beta test later this month, the companies said in a statement on Wednesday. Redbox Instant also will offer an $8-a-month plan with movie streaming plus four one-night DVD rentals from Redbox kiosks, a statement from the companies said. For $9 a month, customers can rent high-definition Blu-ray discs in place of traditional DVDs. Streaming and DVD-by-mail packages start at $16 on Netflix. A Redbox spokeswoman confirmed the company also will offer the $6 streaming-only plan. The shares of Redbox parent Coinstar Inc gained 2.3 percent to close at $51.96 on Nasdaq. Netflix jumped 5.4 percent to $90.73 after a Morgan Stanley analyst raised his price target, citing the company’s strong portfolio of content after last week’s agreement for first-run Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) movies. Verizon shares rose 0.8 percent to $44.79 on the New York Stock Exchange. Coinstar and Verizon formed a joint venture in February to sell video services in a market that is dominated by Netflix, but also has several new entrants, including Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) Prime, Hulu Plus and HBO Go. Redbox Instant subscribers will have access to movies from Viacom Inc’s (VIAB.O) Paramount Pictures, Lions Gate Entertainment LGF.N and MGM through a deal with the Epix premium cable channel, as well as films from Time Warner Inc’s (TWX.N) Warner Bros. That includes recent hits such as teen death match drama, “The Hunger Games,” and Tom Cruise action sequel, “Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol.” Customers will be able to stream the films to certain Internet-connected TVs, phones and tablets. While Redbox Instant will offer a smaller library than Netflix, the new service contains enough content from major Hollywood studios to make it an attractive alternative, said B. Riley & Co analyst Eric Wold. “They don’t need everything Netflix has,” said Wold, who has a “buy” rating on Coinstar and a “sell” on Netflix. “I think it’s going to be a big draw for consumers.” But Morgan Stanley analyst Scott Devitt said Netflix’s broad range of content, enhanced by new Disney movies that will reach the service in 2016, provided a key advantage for a company with 25 million U.S. streaming subscribers. “It’s about having the best and, right now, Netflix clearly has the best content portfolio, domestically,” said Devitt, who raised his price target on Netflix shares to $105 from $80.

356,VZ,Verizon CEO touts wireless beyond the phone,"LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Verizon Communications can generate hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue in coming years from wireless services beyond the mobile phone, in areas ranging from healthcare and automobiles to energy management, the company’s top executive said on Monday. The No. 1 U.S. mobile carrier joins other companies expected to debate and demonstrate the benefits of connecting devices - like cars - to the Internet at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Operators like Verizon consider this an important new business. “It’s safe to say this is a market potential of billions in the 2020 timeframe,” Lowell McAdam told Reuters in an interview. This should translate into a market with “hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for a company the size of us,” he said. “People will be really surprised at what we’re able to do,” he said. “The power of the networks is finally going to be able to provide these sort of things. “In 2013 and 2014 you’re going to begin to see that.” Taking wireless access beyond the mobile device is expected to become a major theme this year in Vegas. And McAdam said the so-called “Internet of Things” would be a big theme of his own keynote speech on Tuesday. For example, wireless connections can allow doctors to remotely diagnose an illness and direct a pharmacist to administer medication, McAdam said. He also talked about public safety improvements, such as the ability of firefighters to navigate a burning building with an infrared camera that has wireless access to its layout. IDC expects the entire market for cellular connections for devices beyond computers or phones to generate revenue of nearly $1 billion by 2016 in the United States alone. Verizon’s biggest rival, AT&T; Inc, announced on Monday that it is pushing ahead with its plan to develop a wireless home security service. McAdam’s comments came moments before he told investors that Verizon Wireless had its strongest fourth-quarter ever in the final three months of 2012, tacking on a net 2.1 million subscribers during a period that saw take-up for the iPhone 5 and other devices accelerate. However, Verizon will take a $1 billion one-time charge related to Hurricane Sandy, which pummeled the east coast and took down infrastructure across the region. A third of the one-time items are covered by insurance, he told a Citigroup investment conference in Vegas. In his wide-ranging interview with Reuters on the sidelines of the world’s largest technology showcase, McAdam, 58, also talked about potential shifts in the industry in coming years. He said he is open to eliminating subsidies on mobile phones that sharply reduce the cost of devices to consumers, but said buyers now prefer paying less up front and paying higher service fees during a long-term wireless contract. Smaller rival T-Mobile USA, a unit of Deutsche Telekom, has announced a plan to get rid of device subsidies this year, but McAdam said it is not clear this would work for Verizon and the rest of the U.S. market. U.S. operators like AT&T; and Verizon typically pay handset makers like Apple Inc hundreds of dollars for every phone, so they can offer discounts to customers that in turn commit to more lucrative service contracts. “It’s very intriguing. Every carrier has thought about doing away with subsidies,” he said, but “I don’t think U.S. consumers are ready to buy an iPhone for $700.” McAdam also urged U.S. regulators, including the Federal Communications Commission, to approve several industry mergers and acquisitions in the pipeline that telecoms observers say have the potential to transform the market. T-Mobile USA is seeking approval to merge with smaller rival MetroPCS Communications Inc. Sprint Nextel is looking for the nod to sell a 70 percent stake to Japan’s Softbank Corp. Some analysts say such combinations could pressure bigger players such as Verizon Wireless, as they face stronger rivals with the ability to compete more aggressively. But McAdam urged U.S. regulators to approve the deals. “Three to four strong carriers are a lot better for the market than a couple of weak ones that are struggling to stay afloat and do dumb things,” said McAdam, referring to the potential for promotions that could ignite a price war. Since McAdam became Verizon CEO, Verizon Wireless - Verizon’s joint venture with Vodafone - gained regulatory approval for a purchase of about $3.9 billion of wireless spectrum from cable companies.

363,VZ,"Lockout officially over, season to begin January 19","(Reuters) - The National Hockey League (NHL) lockout is officially over and a condensed 48-game season will begin next week, the league said on Saturday after signing a memorandum of understanding with the NHL Players’ Association. Training camps will open league-wide on Sunday and the long-awaited regular season will begin on January 19 with 13 games, the NHL said in a statement. The memorandum of understanding, essentially an abridged version of the collective bargaining agreement that spells out the terms under which the league and players will operate, was the last obstacle standing in the way of ending the lockout. Earlier on Saturday the NHLPA said its players voted to ratify the 10-year labor deal the two sides tentatively reached last week after a 16-hour negotiating session. NHL owners had voted unanimously to ratify the deal on Wednesday. The puck will drop on the regular season next week with 26 of the NHL’s 30 teams in action, including the Stanley Cup champion Los Angeles Kings at home to the Chicago Blackhawks. The dispute, which was the league’s fourth work stoppage in 20 years and the first since a lockout wiped out the entire 2004-05 season, began in mid-September and resulted in billions of dollars in lost revenue for the NHL and players. The season was originally scheduled to start last October. ",1132013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nhl-labor-start/lockout-officially-over-season-to-begin-january-19-idUSBRE90C01W20130113

While Verizon’s fourth-quarter bottom line was weaker than anticipated, investors were encouraged when Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said on Tuesday that the company could be in a position to buy back shares sooner than expected and that wireless margins could rise this year to as high as 50 percent. Shammo said the numbers will be helped by $2 billion in cost cuts at Verizon Wireless, Verizon’s mobile venture with Vodafone Group Plc, on top of $5 billion in cuts there in the last three years. The cuts at Verizon Wireless - the biggest U.S. mobile service provider - will not require extensive layoffs and will come in areas such as call center consolidation and increased efficiency in logistics, Shammo told Reuters. Shammo also hinted that Verizon may not have to wait until the end of 2013 to buy back shares as he had previously indicated, thanks to the strength of its balance sheet. “We could do share buybacks at any point in time right now,” he told analysts, without giving a specific time frame. Verizon shares were up 0.6 percent at $42.80 on Tuesday afternoon. But while some analysts were impressed with the 2013 margin target, others questioned whether it is realistic, considering the prospect of stiffer competition from rivals. Pivotal Research Group analyst Steve Sweeney said the target is “aggressive.” Softbank Corp is seeking to buy 70 percent of No. 3 U.S. mobile service provider Sprint Nextel Corp, and Sprint is looking to buy out Clearwire Corp. Also, No. 4 U.S. mobile service T-Mobile USA, a Deutsche Telekom AG  unit, is merging with rival MetroPCS Communications Inc. “2013 will have a much different competitive landscape,” Sweeney said in a research note. “Both new entities will be larger and better capitalized companies than they were in 2012 and represent incremental competition for both Verizon and AT&T.;” Verizon Wireless reported a fourth-quarter service profit margin of 41.4 percent based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, compared with analyst hopes for 42 percent, and with 42.2 percent in the year-ago quarter. The lower fourth-quarter margin was due to higher-than-expected subsidies paid to smartphone makers such as Apple Inc so that Verizon Wireless could offer a phone discount to customers who sign a long-term contract. Rival AT&T; Inc has also warned that high smartphone sales hurt its wireless profit margins because of subsidies. While Shammo was bullish about the wireless business and Verizon’s FiOS home Internet and television services, he warned that the best he could hope for in the company’s enterprise business is that 2013 revenue and profit margins stay flat with 2012 because of a lack of clarity on U.S. economic issues. “In Enterprise, we still see uncertainty around the debt ceiling, deficit reduction, and tax reform,” Shammo told analysts on a quarterly earnings conference call where he also cited worries about international economic growth. The company’s fourth-quarter net loss widened to $4.23 billion, or $1.48 per share, from a loss of $2.02 billion, or 71 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.

366,VZ,CORRECTED-UPDATE 4-Verizon eyes mobile margin jump as Q4 disappoints,"(Corrects paragraph 14 to reflect that 50 cents/shr compares with 45 cents/shr, not 38 cents/shr) * Q4 EPS 38 cents vs Street view 50 cents * Q4 revs $30.05 bln vs view $29.83 bln * Wireless margin 41.4 pct vs 42.2 pct year ago * Says could do share buybacks any time * Eyes $2 billion in wireless cost cuts By Sinead Carew Jan 22 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc posted a weaker-than-expected wireless operating profit margin due to hefty costs from smartphones like Apple’s iPhone, but the U.S telephone company promised a big improvement this year as it cuts costs. While Verizon’s fourth quarter bottom line was weaker than anticipated, investors were encouraged when Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said on Tuesday that the company could be in a position to buy back shares sooner than expected and that wireless margins could rise this year to as high as 50 percent. Shammo said that the numbers will be helped by $2 billion in cost cuts at Verizon Wireless, Verizon’s mobile venture with Vodafone Group Plc, on top of $5 billion cuts there in the last three years. The cuts at Verizon Wireless - the biggest U.S. mobile service provider - will not require a lot of layoffs and will come in areas such as call center consolidation and increased efficiency in logistics, Shammo told Reuters. Shammo also hinted that Verizon may not have to wait until the end of 2013 to buy back shares as he had previously indicated, due to strength of its balance sheet. “We could do share buybacks at any point in time right now,” he told analysts without giving a specific time frame. Verizon shares were up 0.7 percent to $42.83 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange after Shammo’s comments. “Guidance appears strong for 2013,” Stifel Nicolaus analyst Christopher King Said. Verizon Wireless reported a fourth-quarter service profit margin of 41.4 percent based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, compared with analyst hopes for 42 percent and 42.2 percent in the year-ago quarter. The lower fourth-quarter margin was due to higher-than-expected subsidies paid to smartphone makers such as Apple Inc so Verizon Wireless could offer a phone discount to customers who sign a long-term contract. Rival AT&T; Inc has also warned that high smartphone sales hurt its wireless profit margins because of subsidies. While Shammo was bullish about the wireless business and Verizon’s FiOS home Internet and television services, he warned that the best he could hope for in the company’s enterprise business is that 2013 revenue and profit margins stay flat with 2012 because of a lack of clarity on U.S. economic issues. “In Enterprise, we still see uncertainty around the debt ceiling, deficit reduction, and tax reform,” Shammo told analysts on a quarterly earnings conference call where he also cited worries about international economic growth.

However, the telephone company said on Tuesday that it would still be a willing buyer of Vodafone’s 45 percent share of their Verizon Wireless U.S. venture, in line with public statements Verizon has made many times over the years. Verizon’s statement contradicts a report from the Financial Times Alphaville blog on Tuesday that cited unnamed sources saying Verizon and its biggest U.S. rival, AT&T; Inc (T.N), had been working together on a bid for Vodafone in which Verizon would take Vodafone’s U.S. assets and AT&T; would take the rest.

Vodafone rose 2.9 percent after the Financial Times Alphaville blog cited “usually reliable people” as saying that Verizon Communications and AT&T; had been working together on a breakup bid for the British group. The bid would be pitched at about 260 pence a share, around a 40 percent premium to the current price for Vodafone, the world’s second largest mobile operator. “Although much of the news is now in the share price, Tradenext ... will continue to add on any dips. Any inkling of a bid from Verizon will almost certainly drive the shares above 200 pence,” Ronnie Chopra, head of strategy at Tradenext, said. Vodafone’s shares are up around 20 percent in 2013 on persistent M&A; talk. Its weighting accounts for around 6 percent of the entire FTSE 100 and the company’s shares added nearly 10.5 points alone to the index on Tuesday. London’s blue chip index closed up 78.92 points or 1.2 percent at 6,490.66, approaching the 6,533.99 level reached in March, which was this year’s intraday high and its highest level since January 2008. Interdealer broker ICAP, hit hard by a recent profit warning, rebounded 6.1 percent after traders reassessed the company’s value following a move by U.S. exchange operator Nasdaq to buy rival electronic Treasuries-trading platform eSpeed from BGC Partners. British airways owner IAG, which is in talks to buy Spanish budget airline Vueling, climbed 2.9 percent, while Britain’s No.4 grocer Wm Morrison Supermarket, which is seeking a tie-up with Ocado, added 2.5 percent. “I do not think there is an M&A; premium in the market at the moment, but (if M&A; picks up) ... that (bid premium) could push the market even higher,” said James Humphreys, senior investment manager at Duncan Lawrie Private Bank. A revival in merger and acquisition activity and continued stimulus measures from world central banks helped equity markets rise in early 2013, despite a resurgence of the euro zone debt crisis which saw Cyprus bailed out on tough terms last month. “The year has begun with a bit of a bang as far as equity markets are concerned. Though the strength of returns has caught many investors out, the small number of negative days has broadly been seen as opportunities to buy,” Ian Heslop, portfolio manager at Old Mutual Global Equity Fund, said. The FTSE 100 climbed again after a peak-to-trough fall of 2.3 percent towards the end of March on concerns over contagion within Europe. Heslop said the next leg of the rally would be hard to call, but after many years of bond markets having all the headlines, the market may now be seeing the beginning of a period when equities are once again “cool”. “No one wants to win the least ugly contest, but that may be where we are with equities, that they are benefiting from being somewhat more interesting than other investment opportunities,” he said. A JP Morgan Private Bank survey showed European high-net worth individuals are betting stocks will outperform all other asset classes this year and plan to increase their positions. After a brief pause on European debt worries the banks  found firmer ground, up 1.6 percent and supported by a potential weight on their earnings outlook being lifted. Potential losses from private lawsuits related to interest rate-rigging could be materially lower after a U.S. judge dismissed a large portion of such claims. And there could be more gains for the FTSE 100, despite being near five-year highs, as short interest gets squeezed out of the market.

381,VZ,Verizon bid denial sharpens Vodafone wireless focus,"LONDON (Reuters) - With the prospect of a full takeover off the table for now, Vodafone (VOD.L) investors switched focus on Wednesday to whether the British group might sell its best performing asset, its $115 billion stake in Verizon Wireless. Vodafone shares closed down 3 percent after Verizon Communications (VZ.N) said late on Tuesday it had no intention of buying the world’s second largest mobile operator, following months of speculation. The British group’s shares had risen more than 25 percent since the start of the year on hopes it would either sell its 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless and return cash to shareholders, or sell itself to the operator’s majority owner Verizon. Verizon Chief Executive Lowell McAdam declined to comment on the company’s plans with respect to Vodafone at a press event in New York to launch a technology contest. “Nothing has changed for us,” McAdam told reporters, in response to a question about whether his company is any more likely now than before to reach a deal to buy Vodafone’s stake in Verizon Wireless. The day before Verizon repeated its long-held view that “it would be a willing purchaser of the 45 percent stake that Vodafone holds in Verizon Wireless,” in a written statement it had to put out after Vodafone shares rose on deal speculation. “It does not, however, currently have any intention to merge with or make an offer for Vodafone, whether alone or in conjunction with others,” Verizon had said in the statement. One top 15 shareholder in Vodafone told Reuters that Chief Executive Vittorio Colao had played his hand well until now, facing down previous demands to sell the stake in a business that has grown into the biggest mobile operator in the United States. With Vodafone now receiving a hefty annual dividend from the business, the shareholder believes the group is in a stronger position to negotiate an exit when the time is right, and they sense a change in sentiment. “Over the last six months there has been a subtle change of tone from Vodafone management,” the investor said. “While management have always in theory been willing sellers at the right price, I think now it’s more of a practical reality that they are in a place psychologically where they are prepared to sell it.” One of the main sticking points to a deal has been a capital gains tax bill of around $20 billion faced by Vodafone if it sells its holding, meaning Verizon would have to pay a high price to make it worthwhile. “Given that Vodafone will never control the asset, at some point it makes sense to sell it so they are right to be considering that,” the shareholder said. “Vodafone aren’t forced sellers so if the price isn’t right they can walk away and try again.” Strategists at Olivetree Securities said the statement was designed to reach Vodafone shareholders directly, to try and break the deadlock over an exit that has existed since Verizon Wireless was formed by the two groups in 1999. “That message appears to be: ‘If you want a deal, it’s your own management team holding this up - you need to tell them to engage more intensely/shift their price expectations’,” it said. Several people familiar with the situation have told Reuters the two partners have held regular, senior-level talks to discuss options which have ranged from a full takeover, a stake sale and any resolution to the capital gains tax issue. Vodafone has lawyers from Linklaters, bankers from UBS and consultants from McKinsey looking at deal options and structure, according to three people familiar with the situation. But London-based analysts, investors and banking sources believe it will be a struggle to agree a price that suits both groups. Bernstein analyst Robin Bienenstock took the Verizon statement to mean it had approach Vodafone for a deal and been rebuffed. “In other words we view Vodafone as a (very) reluctant seller,” it said. Deutsche Bank suggested that the status quo remained the most likely outcome, and also the most sensible. It said earnings from Verizon Wireless would continue to grow and the annual dividend would support Vodafone at a time when its core European assets are struggling from weak consumer spending.

382,VZ,"Miners, Vodafone drag down Britain's FTSE index","* FTSE 100 index falls 0.5 percent * Mining stocks hurt by metals demand concerns * Vodafone drops on Verizon’s bid denial * Chartists remain positive, support seen at 6,350 By Atul Prakash LONDON, April 3 (Reuters) - Britain’s top share index retreated on Wednesday, pulled down by worries about the global economy which hit mining stocks and by a drop in Vodafone  after Verizon denied making a bid. Miners tracked a drop in metals prices, with copper  falling to an eight-month low, after weak manufacturing data from the United States and Europe this week. The UK mining index fell 1.8 percent to feature among the top decliners, with ENRC, BHP Billiton  and Xstrata falling by between 2.4 to 6 percent. Miners were also pressured by a target price cut by Credit Suisse. “Our view is that with Western central banks in supportive mode, any pull-back will prove temporary and likely bought into by investors still seeking the returns clearly absent from other traditional savings-based products,” said Jeremy Batstone-Carr, head of private client research at Charles Stanley. At 1138 GMT, the blue-chip FTSE 100 index was down 31.11 points, or 0.5 percent, at 6,459.56, after gaining in the last two sessions. Heavyweight Vodafone took the most points off the index after its joint venture partner Verizon Communications sought to end to rampant bid speculation by saying it did not plan to buy the British group. Vodafone shares fell 2 percent. However, analysts remained positive on the stock. “Holders shouldn’t be too concerned at the lack of deal talks confirmation,” Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said. “If anything, intensification of recent market talk just serves to highlight, potentially even increase, the perceived value of the U.S. wireless joint venture. Given this represents Vodafone’s most valuable asset ... this likely underpins the UK giant’s share price in the near term.” The potential sale of the $115 billion stake has driven Vodafone shares up about 25 percent since the start of the year. “The turnaround in Vodafone has clearly not helped the market, with rising tensions in Korea also providing some investors with reasons to take profits,” Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said. “For now, defensive yield-generating sectors still remain in focus, although other selective cyclical sectors such as airlines continue to attract attention.” Technical analysts remained positive on the index’s outlook as it recently rallied from the uptrend line drawn from its November lows. “The market is still in an uptrend and we just have to stay with it,” said Dominic Hawker, technical analyst at Westhouse Securities. “Even if the index breaks its immediate support of 6,350 and falls to 6,100, we would still be in the medium-term uptrend,” he said, adding the index would face strong resistance at its 2007 peak of 6,750.

Vodafone’s slump knocked 0.4 points off the FTSEurofirst 300 index, which was down 2.5 points, or 0.2 percent, at 1,201.23 points. The broader telecoms sector also fell, hit by a bearish note by UBS, which warned about worse-than-expected revenues this year and further dividend cuts, also due to the high level of debt. France Telecom, Telecom Italia and TeliaSonera, which were all downgraded to “sell” by UBS, fell between 0.9 percent and 3.1 percent. The euro zone blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index, which was down 0.6 percent at 2,662.85 points, although the index held above its recent lows in the 2,600 area, seen by chartists as key to confirm the market remained in an uptrend. “We’ve bounced from (2,600) once again so we assume we would be testing once again the 2,740-2,750 area,” said Valerie Gastaldy of Paris-based technical analysis firm Day-By-Day. She cautioned it was crucial that the STOXX 600 banking index, down 0.7 percent at 164.97, kept above its recent low around 160 to confirm the market was in a bullish trend. Banking shares have the largest exposure to the region’s public debt and financing conditions and can be a gauge of investor confidence in Europe’s ability to tackle its crisis. Basic resources stocks were also a drag on the indexes, falling 1.8 percent on revived concerns about an early end to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing programme, which is seen as key to supporting global demand for metals. Policy dove Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and anti-inflation hawk Jeffrey Lacker, chief of the Richmond Fed, sparred pointedly on Thursday over the risks posed to inflation by the U.S. central bank’s asset-buying programme. After what Evans described as “very positive” recent payroll reports, traders were closely watching ADP data on private-sector hiring on Wednesday for clues on the likely outcome of Friday’s big jobs data, exepcted to show an improving economy. “If you get inflation fears relating to ADP numbers, they (the Fed) would reduce QE and that might happen within this year,” the head of a German trading desk said. “The main topic is how long they can control the real interest rate as they are doing, with a very good track record, at the moment. If they can do it, you’re in a bull market, not a bear market.”",4032013,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-europe-stocks-morning/vodafone-weighs-on-european-shares-as-bid-plan-is-denied-idUSL5N0CQ0Y120130403

386,VZ,Verizon beats estimates and raises Vodafone pressure,"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on the performance of its wireless business, which reined in costs without slowing growth. Verizon also ramped up the pressure on Vodafone Group Plc, which owns 45 percent of the Verizon Wireless unit. Verizon has been seeking to buy that stake and take full control of the top U.S. mobile company. During the quarter Verizon Wireless was helped by lower costs and the popularity of its data share plans, under which subscribers can more easily add cellular service to devices like tablets. That represent lower costs for Verizon than smartphones such as Apple Inc’s iPhone. “It just feels like they’re tightening the circle around their customers,” Evercore analyst Jonathan Schildkraut said, referring to Verizon’s ability to retain customers and add more devices through its data share plans. Schildkraut said investors were equally excited about Verizon’s comment that it was “extremely confident” it could buy Vodafone’s stake in the wireless unit without major tax implications for Vodafone shareholders. The tax question is seen by some analysts as one of the biggest barriers to a deal. Vodafone declined to comment. “We actually are confident that in such a transaction we’ve a structure that could be created in a very tax efficient manner,” Verizon Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo told Reuters. Guggenheim analyst Shing Yin said Shammo did not appear to be indicating a deal was imminent but making a public plea to Vodafone to sell the stake by contradicting the tax worries. “I see that as putting a little bit of pressure on Vodafone to do something,” Yin said. Shammo said that Verizon’s long-stated desire to buy the rest of the wireless venture had not changed. Earlier this month, Verizon denied it had any intention of buying Vodafone outright as a way to gain control of the wireless business. Verizon Wireless added 677,000 retail subscribers in the first quarter, slightly higher than Wall Street expectations for about 634,000, according to eight analysts contacted by Reuters. The operator said its wireless service margin of 50.4 percent based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization was a record high. Expectations had ranged from 48.5 percent to 49.9 percent, according to four analysts polled by Reuters. In comparison, its biggest rival AT&T; Inc, which reports first-quarter 2013 results on April 23, posted a wireless margin of 41.6 percent in the year-ago quarter. Verizon also stuck by its previous forecast for a full-year 2013 wireless margin of 49 percent to 50 percent. “They clearly had very good cost control on wireless. The lower upgrades helped but it looked like they were also able to get cost out of the network,” said Guggenheim’s Yin. While Verizon activated 4 million iPhones in the quarter, up from 3.2 million in the year-ago quarter, it said that half of those activations were for older, cheaper iPhones. Apple shares have been sliding on fears of weakening demand for the iPhone. On the plus side for Apple, though, its share of Verizon’s smartphone activations rose to 56 percent from about 51 percent in the year-ago quarter, according to Guggenheim’s Yin. “To Apple’s credit the iPhone continues to gain share” at Verizon Wireless, Yin said. Aside from the wireless business, Verizon Communications also saw improved growth in its FiOS home Internet and television service 188,000 net new FiOS Internet customers and 169,000 FiOS television subscribers in the quarter. Hudson Square analyst Todd Rethemeier had expected 150,000 Internet customers and 125,000 FiOS TV customers. “Across the board subscriber numbers in both wireline and wireless looked pretty good,” said Rethemeier. Verizon’s Shammo also confirmed that Verizon had put in an offer to Clearwire Corp to buy wireless airwaves in a bid to expand capacity. Verizon’s earnings rose to $1.95 billion, or 68 cents per share, compared with $1.69 billion or 59 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts expected earnings of 66 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose to $29.42 billion from $28.24 billion and compared with Wall Street estimates of $29.55 billion. Verizon shares were up $1.63 at $51.14 in early afternoon trade, after rising as high as $51.67 percent earlier on the New York Stock Exchange. AT&T; shares rose 6 cents to $37.84. Apple shares were down about 2 percent, or $8, at $394.80 on Nasdaq.

393,VZ,Exclusive: Verizon eyes roughly $100 billion bid for Vodafone's wireless stake,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc has hired advisers to prepare a possible $100 billion bid to take full control of Verizon Wireless from its partner Vodafone Group Plc, two people familiar with the matter said. Verizon is contemplating a roughly 50:50 cash and stock bid for the 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless it does not already own, an asset it has long coveted, the sources said. It has not put a proposal to Vodafone yet but has hired banking and legal advisers for a possible offer, the sources said late Wednesday. There are no guarantees that Vodafone will be interested in a deal or that any bid will materialize, the sources said. But they said Verizon was ready to push aggressively and hoped to start discussions with Vodafone soon for a friendly agreement. Verizon is also prepared to take a bid public if the British company does not engage in talks, one of the sources said. A Verizon spokesman declined to comment. Vodafone declined to comment. Verizon Wireless was not available for comment. Shares in Vodafone, the world’s second-largest mobile operator, rose 1.6 percent in London, while Verizon shares were up 2.5 percent in New York. Verizon, which has made little secret of its wish to buy out its British partner in the biggest U.S. mobile operator, has ramped up the pressure in recent months, saying that it believed it could buy the asset in a tax-efficient way. The company’s move to hire advisers and the sources’ revelation of a price range highlight the company’s seriousness about doing a deal. At $100 billion, a deal would be the third-largest acquisition ever, according to Thomson Reuters data, and would come amid a new round of industry consolidation. Investors say the conditions for a deal have improved as a result of Verizon’s strong results, its share price gains, and low interest rates. Verizon shares are valued at 17.9 times forward earnings, compared with a multiple of m11.8 for Vodafone. “It would depend on how the deal is structured and what the cost of financing is. But we think the deal at $100 billion would be viable for Verizon to do,” said Louis Cimino, portfolio manager at Reaves Asset Management in New Jersey, which owns about 1.8 million Verizon shares. He said he would support a deal even if the price rose to $120 billion. The sources said Verizon is confident it can raise about $50 billion of bank financing to fund a deal. Market demand for investment-grade debt is proving almost limitless in the current environment, and Verizon could expect a warm welcome from investors, even with a fund-raising as big as $50 billion, bankers told Reuters. “This is a good time for both sides to think seriously about a transaction. Vodafone’s probably never going to get a better multiple than now,” New Street analyst Jonathan Chaplin said. “The growth rate (for Verizon Wireless) probably has to slow over time, particularly as Sprint and T-Mobile USA and AT&T; improve.” Several challenges remain, however. Analysts and Vodafone investors said the roughly $100 billion figure contemplated by Verizon was too low and likely more of an opening gambit to bring the British firm to the table. Most analysts had put the value of the Vodafone holding at nearer $120 billion. One top-40 Vodafone investor, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was “absolutely no way” it will be $100 billion, but that $135 billion would suffice. A key obstacle to a deal so far has been the expectation that Vodafone could incur a hefty tax bill of around $20 billion if it sells its holding, meaning Verizon would have to pay up to make it worthwhile for the British company. But the sources who spoke to Reuters late on Wednesday said any deal would be structured such that the eventual tax bill would likely be $5 billion or less. Under the deal structure, Verizon would buy Vodafone’s U.S. holding company, which owns the British group’s Verizon Wireless interest as well as some other assets in countries such as Germany and Spain, the sources said. This structure would allow Verizon to take advantage of a provision in British tax law called substantial shareholder exemption, they said. Chaplin said the tax bill estimate of $5 billion was consistent with his calculations. Vodafone Chief Executive Vittorio Colao has said he has an open mind on whether to sell the group’s 45 percent stake, which has come to make up around 75 percent of the firm’s value in recent years as its core European business suffered. Analysts have said a sale of Verizon Wireless would enable Vodafone to return cash to shareholders, purchase fixed-line assets in Europe, or potentially make the company an attractive takeover target for other telecom giants such as AT&T; Inc. One of Vodafone’s 15 largest investors said the company should look to return to shareholders a large portion of the proceeds from a sale, while retaining a small amount to reduce debt and fund bolt-on deals. Shares in Vodafone have risen 26 percent this year on speculation that it could finally be ready to sell its stake. Verizon’s board is expected to discuss details of a potential Verizon Wireless buyout next week at a regularly scheduled meeting being held ahead of the company’s annual shareholder meeting, one of the sources said. Taking full ownership of Verizon Wireless would give Verizon, which is reliant on the unit for growth, a lot more flexibility with the cash generated from the wireless business. In a research note, Chaplin said a deal at $100 billion would boost Verizon’s earnings per share in 2014 by 33 percent. Verizon’s shares have risen about 20 percent this year as Verizon Wireless has been easily outperforming its smaller rivals in terms of profitability and customer growth, and on rising hopes of a buyout. Any deal now, if it were to happen, would come at a time when the telecommunications industry is undergoing a fresh round of consolidation. MetroPCS Communications Inc shareholders voted Wednesday to approve a merger with T-Mobile USA, a unit of Deutsche Telekom AG. An attempt by Deutsche Telekom to sell T-Mobile to AT&T; for $39 billion in 2011 was blocked by U.S. antitrust regulators. Verizon would be unlikely to face any such obstacles in a Verizon Wireless buyout. Meanwhile, Dish Network Corp, the No. 2 U.S. satellite TV provider, last week offered to buy wireless service provider Sprint Nextel Corp for $25.5 billion in cash and stock, challenging a proposed deal between Sprint and Japan’s SoftBank Corp.

The two sources familiar with the situation said Verizon had hired advisers to prepare a possible cash and stock bid to buy out Vodafone’s 45 percent stake in the highly successful business. Vodafone and Verizon declined to comment on the reports.

398,VZ,Vodafone investors want bigger bid or full takeover by Verizon,"LONDON (Reuters) - Six major Vodafone investors said $100 billion was not enough for the British company’s stake in its U.S. joint venture with Verizon Communications, and urged the latter to come up with an offer of at least $120 billion. Their comments followed a Reuters report on Wednesday that Verizon had hired advisers to prepare a possible $100 billion bid to buy Vodafone’s 45 percent stake in their Verizon Wireless joint venture, likely to be structured as a roughly 50:50 cash and stock bid. Should the $100 billion figure stand, the six shareholders, with around 1.3 billion of Vodafone’s shares between them, said they would prefer the British group to push for a full merger with Verizon instead. The main concern among investors contacted by Reuters was the fact that a sale of Verizon Wireless - the best performing asset by far in the Vodafone portfolio - would highlight the operator’s exposure to its troubled European markets. “Without wishing to be too disrespectful, (Vodafone is) sitting with a rather ugly set of assets once you lose the Verizon Wireless stake,” said Ralph Brook-Fox, UK equities fund manager at Ignis Asset Management, a top 40 institutional shareholder in Vodafone. “I think the merger or full takeover scenario, although not at the forefront of discussions right now, could actually end up being the more palatable deal.” Verizon Communications released a statement earlier this month to say it did not have any intention to merge or make an offer for Vodafone following bid speculation. Vodafone’s share of Verizon Wireless represented around half of the British group’s adjusted operating profit in the six months to the end of September 2012, according to its financial results. It also received before the end of 2012 a 2.4 billion pound dividend from its Verizon Wireless stake, and said it would pass on 1.5 billion pounds to its shareholders via a buyback, showing the importance to the group of its holding. Among its core European operations Vodafone operates in crisis-hit and heavily regulated markets such as Italy, Spain and Portugal, where revenues have come under pressure because of economic turmoil and intense competition. With that in mind, investors contacted by Reuters would rather an offer for the stake at between $120 billion and $135 billion as acceptable. At its current share price, Vodafone’s whole market capitalization stands at around $146 billion. “I think ... $120 billion is the point where you think you’ve got a decent premium,” one top 20 shareholder said, on the condition of anonymity. “I think that’s reasonable and if they achieve that, I think the (Vodafone) shares go up.” Another big question mark for Vodafone and its shareholders is the potential tax bill the sale of its stake would incur: anywhere between $5 billion and $25 billion. The wide range is due to a lack of clarity about which holding companies within Vodafone own which assets - for instance Vodafone America holds assets in a number of other jurisdictions - leaving those outside the company unable to say with any conviction how much tax would need to be paid.

400,VZ,Analysis: Tax strategy may be key to Verizon Wireless deal,"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc’s chances of buying the 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless owned by Britain’s Vodafone Group Plc will hinge, at least in part, on the quality of tax advice it is getting. Verizon, the No. 2 U.S. telecommunications company, may have found a way to structure a purchase of the stake so that Vodafone can avoid a multibillion-dollar U.S. capital gains tax bill, sources familiar with Verizon’s plans said. The possibility of a huge tax bill has previously been regarded by analysts as a big hurdle to any such deal. Reuters reported last Wednesday that Verizon was preparing a bid worth about $100 billion to take full control of Verizon Wireless - it already owns the other 55 percent - by buying the stake, according to people familiar with the matter. There are no guarantees that Vodafone will want to sell its stake or that Verizon will pursue the plan. Vodafone declined to comment on the possibility of a Verizon bid for its stake or on the tax question. One person familiar with the situation said Vodafone cannot consider the size of any tax payout in a possible transaction until the company has received an offer, which it has not. A Verizon spokesman declined to comment. Verizon hopes that if it structures a transaction to eliminate much of the tax bill, it can encourage Vodafone to come to the table for talks. Some analysts and investors say Verizon may have to pay as much as $130 billion to clinch the deal. The tax bill on a $100 billion deal, based on a simple acquisition of the stake, would be about $38 billion, according to UBS Investment Research. It could be much higher if the deal’s price tag rises above that figure, UBS noted. That tax bill is based on the massive growth Verizon Wireless has experienced since it was established 13 years ago. The 45 percent stake that Verizon Communications wants to buy is owned by Vodafone Americas, a U.S. holding company. Given it is a U.S. entity, if Vodafone Americas were to sell that stake outright it would have to pay the full capital gains tax on the stake. But the sources said Verizon Communications is contemplating a two-part deal that could avoid this. Instead of buying the stake outright, the sources said, Verizon Communications would buy the Delaware-based Vodafone Americas. The seller of Vodafone Americas would not be a U.S.-based entity, so no U.S. capital gains tax would be due, said Robert Willens, a tax and accounting expert and author of the Willens Report. Vodafone’s international structure is complicated, involving many holding companies, and the precise ownership of some assets is unclear. Vodafone Americas also owns some of Vodafone’s non-U.S. assets, the sources said, probably including some in Germany and Spain. These would be sold back to Vodafone by Verizon Communications, which would keep the Verizon Wireless stake, they said. The two transactions could be done simultaneously or one after the other. While the sale of the Verizon Wireless stake would not incur capital gains tax, the sale of the international assets back to Vodafone would. This is because it would involve the sale of assets by Verizon Communications, a U.S. entity. Compared with Verizon Wireless, the smaller international assets are thought to have gained little in value. Analysts estimated their sale could hit Verizon Communications with a U.S. tax bill of about $5 billion or less. The sources said that Verizon would seek to pass any tax hit on to Vodafone in the two-part transaction. Verizon has long coveted its partner Vodafone’s stake in the Verizon Wireless joint venture, which started operations in 2000. The last time the two came close to a deal was in 2004, when Vodafone bid for AT&T; Wireless. The British company, the world’s second-largest mobile operator, however, lost that bid to Cingular and has since held on to the Verizon Wireless stake for its exposure to the U.S. wireless market. Wall Street analysts had previously seen it as unlikely that Verizon would want to do a deal involving Vodafone Americas’ international assets. But those assets have underperformed in recent years when compared with the growth of Verizon Wireless, and are now a smaller part of the holding company, reducing the potential tax hit. However, the timing of Verizon’s interest in doing the deal has more to do with the gains in its stock price and low interest rates, the sources emphasized. Verizon is considering paying about half of the purchase price in cash and half in stock, Reuters reported on Wednesday. That means it may look to raise around $50 billion in debt. The kind of deal structure envisaged would still leave Vodafone with another tax question, said British academics and analysts: Should it leave the proceeds from any sale offshore or bring them home to Britain? Leaving the money offshore might invite scrutiny from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, which sometimes questions transactions if they seem designed solely to avoid tax and are not based on an underlying economic logic, said Prems Sikka, professor of accounting at the University of Essex in Britain. If the transaction were shaped the way the sources have described, Vodafone would probably repatriate the proceeds into Britain, said Charles Merriman, managing director at Merriman Capital Transactions, a consultancy in London. Once that was done, he said, the company might be able to reduce its tax bill by taking advantage of Britain’s substantial shareholdings exemption. Under certain conditions, this exempts from UK corporation taxation any gains realized when one company disposes of shares in another company. British tax authorities declined to comment, citing rules on taxpayer confidentiality. More broadly, though, Vodafone could face a political backlash in Britain from any deal that was clearly structured to avoid taxation, said Robin Bienenstock, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research. U.S. companies such as Starbucks Corp, Amazon.com Inc and Google Inc have come under fire from British lawmakers for using legal maneuvers to cut their tax bills in Britain. “The problem with tax is not just the technical ability to avoid it, but the scorched earth that trying to avoid it could leave with the UK government afterwards,” said Bienenstock. “Recent tax cases in the UK ... suggest that an attempt to avoid tax on such a large and high-profile deal would be very badly received.” ",4292013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-verizon-vodafone-tax/analysis-tax-strategy-may-be-key-to-verizon-wireless-deal-idUSBRE93S02O20130429
401,VZ,Britain's FTSE rangebound as Vodafone slides,"* FTSE 100 down 1.59 points * Vodafone down as investors demand more for Verizon * Aberdeen Asset Mgt rallies after revenues leap By David Brett LONDON, April 29 (Reuters) - Britain’s top shares were rangebound by midday on Monday as investors sought out more reliable sectors, with Vodafone the biggest weight dragging on the index, while Aberdeen Asset Management  rose after results. By 1025 GMT, London’s blue chip index was down 1.59 points at 6,424.83, just below levels around 6,500 from which the index has already sold off from twice in 2013. “The FTSE 100 remains in a sideways range between 6,200 and 6,500: I would still regard this as healthy consolidation within the context of a longer term uptrend,” Dominic Hawker, technical strategist at Messels, said. Vodafone shaved 1.6 points off the FTSE 100  after six major Vodafone investors said $100 billion was not enough for the British company’s stake in its U.S. joint venture with Verizon Communications VZ.N, and urged the latter to come up with an offer of at least $120 billion. Vodafone’s shares have rallied 28 percent so far in 2013, outperforming a near 9 percent rise on the FTSE 100, while investors remain hopeful of a full takeover from Verizon. Elsewhere among the fallers the world’s largest advertising group WPP shed 1.3 percent as HSBC cut its recommendation on the firm to “neutral” from “overweight”, following results last week, Berenberg Bank kept its “sell” stance on WPP given limited visibility on earnings. Earnings concerns remain a major stumbling block on indexes which are hovering around multi-year highs as weak sentiment surrounding the global economy, particularly in the euro zone, Britain’s largest trading partner, remains. Defensive areas of the market such as utilities and consumer staples were the top risers on the FTSE 100 on Monday as investors remained cautious in their stock selection. But with the index up around 9 percent this year despite anemic global growth, the increased activity is giving asset managers a boost. Aberdeen Asset Management surged 8.9 percent after the fund firm reported first-half revenues leapt 25 percent. “We expect Aberdeen to post (earnings per share)in the range of 29p/30p for FY13 (compared with consensus of 27.87, according to Starmine data) and we should see EPS upgrades if markets hold at current levels,” Canaccord Genuity said in a note. That lifted sentiment among peers with Schroders up 2.3 percent, which helped the broader financial sector, including banks, add 3 points to the broader FTSE 100. Financials also received some support after Italy ended months of political deadlock by forming a government. The deal brings an end to weeks of political uncertainty that had could have potentially further destabilised the euro zone economy, a region to which British financial institutions have great exposure.

403,VZ,"Verizon to invest $100 million in solar, fuel cell technology","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Verizon said on Tuesday it plans to invest $100 million in solar power and fuel cells at 19 facilities in seven U.S. states to cut its carbon footprint and make its operations more resilient to storms and other disasters. The energy project should be complete by next year, with installations at corporate offices, call centers, data centers and central offices of the telecommunications giant in Arizona, California, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and North Carolina. The fuel cells will be powered by natural gas, which emits less climate-warming carbon dioxide than diesel or petroleum when burned, said James Gowen, chief sustainability officer for Verizon Communications Inc. Gowen declined to say how much money the telecommunications company would save with this investment, but did say it would be good for the bottom line. “I have a CFO and a CEO who are telling me quite often, ‘We are not going green for green’s sake.’ So we absolutely have a positive return on investment based on a 10-year net present value,” Gowen said in a telephone interview. Like many other U.S. companies, Verizon aims to be more environmentally sustainable and beef up its green credentials, but another key reason for the energy shift was to bolster reliability.

407,VZ,RPT-DEALTALK-Some Verizon investors OK with paying premium for Vodafone stake,"By Sinead Carew and Kate Holton NEW YORK/LONDON, May 6 (Reuters) - Some shareholders of Verizon Communications Inc say they could be happy for the company to pay up to $130 billion for Vodafone Group Plc’s  stake in their U.S. wireless venture. Reuters reported last week that Verizon had hired advisers to prepare a $100 billion cash-and-stock bid for Vodafone’s 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless, though several major Vodafone investors have said that figure is inadequate. Two large shareholders in Verizon told Reuters they could be comfortable with paying 20 percent to 30 percent more to secure the No.1 U.S. mobile service provider, which generates 66 percent of Verizon’s revenue and almost all of its profit. “No way do I dream that $100 billion is going to get this deal done. It’s just not going to happen,” said Craig Leopold, portfolio manager at Columbia Management Investment advisors. His firm, with $341 billion assets under management, is Verizon’s 10th-largest shareholder with 22 million shares, according to the latest publicly available records. “I think shareholders would be willing to accept a price as high as $130 billion because it would still be accretive to Verizon. But the preference would be a lower price like $120 billion,” Leopold said. Verizon declined to comment on what it might be willing to pay for full ownership of Verizon Wireless, and it is not clear if the company would be willing to go beyond $100 billion, which would already be the third-largest deal on record. Spending so much on the business is not without risk for Verizon: there are few cost-savings to be had, and the mature U.S. mobile market is expected to become a much tougher place to compete in due to strengthening rivals and slowing growth, analysts said. Not all Verizon shareholders are happy about the company shelling out big bucks. Bill Jones, president of the Association of BellTel Retirees, said he sees strategic benefits from such a deal, but worries that Verizon will overpay. About 72 percent of his group’s 128,000 members own Verizon shares. “If they can’t afford $8.5 billion to put the pension fund on a good footing, how are they going to come up with $130 billion to pay Vodafone?” said Jones, who is currently surveying the BellTel members to estimate their collective holdings. Verizon Chief Executive Lowell McAdam told analysts this week that he did not believe a premium would be needed to buy the stake, and warned Vodafone of a “lean” year for dividend payments from their wireless venture. On the plus side, there are no obvious integration costs from such a transaction as the wireless venture is already run by Verizon. The deal would immediately boost earnings per share as Verizon would keep 100 percent of profits. Leopold estimated Verizon could lift its 2014 earnings per share by more than 20 percent if it bought the Vodafone stake for $120 billion, or by about 15 percent if it paid $130 billion.

408,VZ,Some Verizon investors OK with paying premium for Vodafone stake,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Some shareholders of Verizon Communications Inc say they could be happy for the company to pay up to $130 billion for Vodafone Group Plc’s stake in their U.S. wireless venture. Reuters reported last week that Verizon had hired advisers to prepare a $100 billion cash-and-stock bid for Vodafone’s 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless, though several major Vodafone investors have said that figure is inadequate. Two large shareholders in Verizon told Reuters they could be comfortable with paying 20 percent to 30 percent more to secure the No.1 U.S. mobile service provider, which generates 66 percent of Verizon’s revenue and almost all of its profit. “No way do I dream that $100 billion is going to get this deal done. It’s just not going to happen,” said Craig Leopold, portfolio manager at Columbia Management Investment advisors. His firm, with $341 billion assets under management, is Verizon’s 10th-largest shareholder with 22 million shares, according to the latest publicly available records. “I think shareholders would be willing to accept a price as high as $130 billion because it would still be accretive to Verizon. But the preference would be a lower price like $120 billion,” Leopold said. Verizon declined to comment on what it might be willing to pay for full ownership of Verizon Wireless, and it is not clear if the company would be willing to go beyond $100 billion, which would already be the third-largest deal on record. Spending so much on the business is not without risk for Verizon: there are few cost-savings to be had, and the mature U.S. mobile market is expected to become a much tougher place to compete in due to strengthening rivals and slowing growth, analysts said. Not all Verizon shareholders are happy about the company shelling out big bucks. Bill Jones, president of the Association of BellTel Retirees, said he sees strategic benefits from such a deal, but worries that Verizon will overpay. About 72 percent of his group’s 128,000 members own Verizon shares. “If they can’t afford $8.5 billion to put the pension fund on a good footing, how are they going to come up with $130 billion to pay Vodafone?” said Jones, who is currently surveying the BellTel members to estimate their collective holdings. Verizon Chief Executive Lowell McAdam told analysts this week that he did not believe a premium would be needed to buy the stake, and warned Vodafone of a “lean” year for dividend payments from their wireless venture. On the plus side, there are no obvious integration costs from such a transaction as the wireless venture is already run by Verizon. The deal would immediately boost earnings per share as Verizon would keep 100 percent of profits. Leopold estimated Verizon could lift its 2014 earnings per share by more than 20 percent if it bought the Vodafone stake for $120 billion, or by about 15 percent if it paid $130 billion.

411,VZ,Verizon Wireless to pay parents surprise $7 billion dividend,"(Reuters) - Verizon Wireless, the biggest U.S. mobile service provider, said on Monday it would pay its parents Verizon Communications and Vodafone Group Plc a dividend of $7 billion in June, surprising some analysts who had not expected a big payout. The dividend comes amid mounting speculation Verizon could buy Vodafone’s stake in the venture if they can agree on a price. Reuters reported on April 24 that Verizon was preparing a $100 billion bid for the stake but investors have said they expect Vodafone to seek a higher price. The dividend decision follows recent comments from Verizon Chief Executive Lowell McAdam to JP Morgan analysts that he did not want to pay a premium for the stake and that the two owners could face a “lean” year in terms of the Verizon Wireless dividend. “I wouldn’t call that lean,” said Evercore analyst Jonathan Schildkraut referring to the $7 billion dividend, which is payable on June 25. Verizon, which controls the wireless venture and dividend decisions, declined to comment on the Verizon Wireless statement on Monday. Vodafone had no immediate comment. Schildkraut said he was surprised by the decision as he read McAdam’s previous comments as a sign that the executive wanted to put pressure on Vodafone to agree to a deal. Schildkraut said he does not think Verizon has an urgent need for cash. “Despite more contentious commentary from Verizon management it’s just does not appear that withholding Verizon Wireless cash flow from Vodafone is likely to be part of the negotiation,” Schildkraut said. The Verizon Wireless board decided on the dividend on May 9, according a filing the company made with regulators. The wireless venture’s last dividend to its parents was a $8.5 billion payout in the fourth quarter of 2012, which followed with a $10 billion pay-out made in January of 2012. Verizon had refused to sanction a dividend from the Wireless asset between 2005 and 2011 because it said it preferred to pay down debt and make acquisitions. At the time that was seen by analysts as a move to pressure Vodafone out of the venture. Based on Verizon’s 55 percent ownership of the venture and Vodafone’s 45 percent stake, the June pay-out will bring Verizon cash payments of $3.85 billion while Vodafone will receive $3.15 billion, according to the company. Verizon shares rose slightly in late trade to $53 after closing at $52.55 on the New York Stock Exchange.

412,VZ,UPDATE 1-Verizon sees no need for mobile venture cash to fund dividend,"NEW YORK, May 14 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc  does not need more cash from its wireless venture with Vodafone Group Plc to support its own dividend payments, Verizon Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said on Tuesday. Shammo also said future dividends from Verizon Wireless would be leaner than in the past. Verizon controls the venture’s dividend payments and analysts have speculated that it could use this control to pressure Vodafone into selling its Verizon Wireless stake. Verizon owns 55 percent of the wireless venture. Shammo made the comments at a conference the day after Verizon Wireless, which is 45 percent owned by Vodafone, declared a $7 billion dividend. In comparison, Verizon Wireless paid its parents $18.5 billion in 2012, in two installments. “If I needed the cash from wireless to pay a dividend I’d take the cash but I don’t see us needing the cash,” Shammo said. Nomura analyst Michael McCormack said he does not think Verizon needs more cash to support its dividend this year. He estimated that Verizon’s annual dividend obligation is about $5.7 billion and that it has more than $6 billion in cash to support that this year. Shammo’s comments came amid mounting speculation Verizon could buy Vodafone’s stake in the venture if they can agree on a price. Reuters, on April 24, cited sources as saying that Verizon was preparing a $100 billion bid for the stake, but investors have said they expect Vodafone to seek a higher price. Shammo declined to comment on the potential for a Verizon purchase of Vodafone’s stake in Verizon Wireless. Vodafone said on Tuesday that it would announce how it intends to use the dividend cash from Verizon Wireless when it reports its quarterly results on May 21. The UK company returned a large chunk of earlier payouts to shareholders, either via a special dividend or a share buyback. Shammo also cautioned that Verizon Wireless would conserve cash to pay down debt and prepare for a spectrum auction, which could affect future dividends. The venture will use cash to pay down $5 billion in debt due at the end of this year and early next year, Shammo said. It is also preparing to participate in a U.S. auction of wireless airwaves that could take place as soon as 2014. Verizon shares were up 38 cents at $52.93 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Vodafone shares were unchanged at the close of trading in London on Tuesday.",5142013,http://www.reuters.com/article/verizon-shammo/update-1-verizon-sees-no-need-for-mobile-venture-cash-to-fund-dividend-idUSL2N0DV2PO20130514

415,VZ,BUYOUTS-Miami entrepreneur seeks $250 mln for debut cybersecurity,"* Manny Medina sold Terremark to Verizon in $2 bln deal * Has $50 mln lined up from family, friends * Greenhill hired to help raise fund By Steve Gelsi NEW YORK, May 15 (Reuters-BUYOUTS) - Miami-based entrepreneur Manuel “Manny” Medina of Medina Capital has lined up an estimated $50 million from family and friends as part of an effort to raise $250 million for a debut private equity fund, a source said. It has been about two years since Medina sold his information technology company Terremark Worldwide to Verizon Communications Inc. in a deal valued at $2 billion. Medina Capital Fund LP lists its minimum investment accepted from outside investors at $100,000, and its sales compensation recipient as Greenhill & Co Inc, according to a Form D filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm disclosed a fund target of $250 million, with no sales yet reported as of April 18, according to the filing, which includes the note that “final size of the fund may be higher or lower than the target.” Medina did not return a phone call seeking comment. Within the next two weeks a commitment of about $50 million from family and friends is expected to close with contributions from C-suite executives in the IT arena who had worked with Terremark in the past, according to the source. Taking a tack toward IT and security, Medina Capital has already made investments in Prolexic, a specialist in thwarting hacker attacks, and Catbird, a self-described pioneer in security and compliance for virtual, cloud and physical networks. Medina Capital invests $10 million to $20 million per portfolio company, according to its Web site. It plans to hold majority equity interests in its target companies or a significant minority interest with typical minority investor protective provisions and board appointment rights. Members of the Medina Capital team include Nelson Fonseca, Barry Field, Rene Rodriguez, Adam Smith and Randy Rowland - all veterans of Terremark. The firm’s advisory board includes Guillermo Amore, who worked for 33 years at GTE Corp.; Gary Denman, Robert Dickinson, Antonio Fernandez, Joseph Wright and Arthur Money. Medina emigrated to the United States from Cuba at a young age and went on to earn a Bachelor of Science in accounting at Florida Atlantic University, according to a profile in the Miami Herald. His son, Manuel Medina Jr., is a Nashville musician and bass player for the Kip Moore band, which has a hit record, Somethin’ Bout a Truck. The elder Medina founded Terremark in 1980 and sold the specialist in cloud computing and IT infrastructure to Verizon in 2011. Publicly traded on the Nasdaq at the time of the sale, the company currently operates under the name Verizon Terremark. Medina spent the first month after the transaction traveling, thanking major shareholders, analysts, customers and suppliers and telling them that “contrary to rumors, I was not retiring, but that I would be disappearing for a while,” according to the profile. He headed down to the Florida Keys with his children and grandchildren and decided to start investing in IT-related companies. “We are looking for established companies with a unique business model or technology that we can help with capital and strategy,” he told the newspaper. Medina stressed that his experience at Terremark working across international borders, growing product lines, and building relationships with people in government would be “very helpful for the right company at the right stage.” ",5152013,http://www.reuters.com/article/buyouts-mannymedina/buyouts-miami-entrepreneur-seeks-250-mln-for-debut-cybersecurity-idUSL2N0DW33720130515

418,VZ,Obama administration defends massive phone record collection,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration on Thursday defended its collection of the telephone records of millions of Americans as part of U.S. counterterrorism efforts, re-igniting a fierce debate over privacy even as it called the program critical to warding off an attack. The admission came after Britain’s Guardian newspaper published on Wednesday a secret court order authorizing the collection of phone records generated by millions of Verizon Communications customers. Privacy advocates blasted the order as unconstitutional government surveillance and called for a review of the program amid renewed concerns about intelligence-gathering efforts launched after the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. The revelation also put a spotlight on the handling of intelligence and privacy issues by President Barack Obama’s administration, which already is under fire for searching the telephone records of Associated Press journalists and the emails and phone records of a Fox News Channel reporter as part of its inquiries into leaked government information. “The United States should not be accumulating phone records on tens of millions of innocent Americans. That is not what democracy is about. That is not what freedom is about,” said Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont. The White House said strict controls were in place to ensure the program did not violate civil liberties, and emphasized that the collection of data did not include listening to the calls. “The intelligence community is conducting court-authorized intelligence activities pursuant to public statute with the knowledge and oversight of Congress,” White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters. Republican Mike Rogers of Michigan, chairman of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, said the program did not abuse civil liberties and told reporters it had been used to stop a “significant” terrorist attack within the United States, but did not give details. “It’s called protecting America,” added Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee. Leading members of Congress said the program had been going on for seven years. The White House and U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said lawmakers were fully briefed. A senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the published court order pertained only to data such as a telephone number or the length of a call, not the subscribers’ identities or listening to the actual calls. The order requires Verizon to turn over to the National Security Agency “metadata” such as a list of numbers that called other U.S. or international numbers as well as other information on the time and location of calls. The NSA is the main U.S. intelligence-gathering agency tasked with monitoring electronic communications. “Information of the sort described in the Guardian article has been a critical tool in protecting the nation from terrorist threats to the United States, as it allows counterterrorism personnel to discover whether known or suspected terrorists have been in contact with other persons who may be engaged in terrorist activities, particularly people located inside the United States,” the senior administration official said. Verizon has declined to comment. It remains unclear whether the practice extends to other carriers, although several security experts and a U.S. official said that was likely. AT&T; Inc declined to comment. Representatives for other major carriers, including Sprint Nextel Corp and T-Mobile, could not be immediately reached or had no immediate comment. The three-month court order, dated April 25, directs Verizon’s Business Network Services Inc and Verizon Business Services units to hand over daily electronic data until July 19. It was issued one week after U.S. law enforcement officials tracked down the two brothers accused of carrying out the deadly Boston Marathon bombing. Investigators in that case had been looking into calls made from their phones and had been searching for one brother’s laptop computer. A U.S. official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said this particular surveillance order was not issued in reaction to the April 15 bombing. The April order compels Verizon to turn over both international calling records and domestic records, and refers to mobile and landline numbers, according to the Guardian’s copy, which was labeled “top secret” and issued by the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The four-page document does not lay out why the order was given or whether it was linked to any specific investigation. Thursday’s admission highlights the ongoing and controversial campaign of domestic surveillance launched under Republican President George W. Bush’s administration after the 2001 attacks. A 2001 U.S. law known as the Patriot Act allows the FBI to seek an order to obtain “any tangible thing,” including business records, to gather intelligence. The senior administration official said that “there is a robust legal regime in place governing all activities” like the one outlined in the order and that “all three branches of government are involved in reviewing and authorizing intelligence collection.” But the order raised questions about what authorities hoped to learn by sorting through the phone data. Terrorism financing expert Jimmy Gurulé, a former assistant U.S. attorney general and now a law professor at University of Notre Dame, said the order goes too far. “The question is how the phone data of tens of millions of Americans is ‘relevant’ to a terrorism investigation. This is clearly an overreach by the NSA and an apparent rubber stamp by the FISA court,” Gurulé said. It was unclear if members of Congress knew the scope of the data collection. Republican Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois told Holder at a public hearing on the Justice Department’s budget that he was concerned the program could be used to obtain the phone records of members of Congress or the U.S. Supreme Court. “There has been no intention to do anything of that nature, that is to spy on members of Congress, to spy on members of the Supreme Court,” Holder said, although he added he could not get into specifics of the program in public. Administration and congressional officials said members of the House and Senate intelligence committees had been briefed in detail about collection activities on multiple occasions. One official said the intelligence panels also provided information on the program to any other lawmaker who sought it. “If we didn’t do it, we’d be crazy,” Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said of data collection. The American Civil Liberties Union, among other groups, called on Congress to investigate the scope of the effort, which it labeled “alarming” and “unconstitutional.” “It’s a program in which some untold number of innocent people have been put under the constant surveillance of government agents,” the ACLU’s Jameel Jaffer said.

419,VZ,Verizon order casts spotlight on secretive U.S. surveillance court,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The leak of a document showing the Obama administration asked for millions of phone records has turned a spotlight anew on a secretive U.S. federal court set up 35 years ago to curb intelligence abuses. Made up of 11 judges who serve staggered seven-year terms, it is called the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The judges’ identities are known, along with the name of the person who appoints them: the chief justice, now John Roberts. In a departure from other courts, all of its rulings are secret and there is no adversarial system. Instead, government lawyers make a request and the judge either approves or rejects it. No other parties are present. The court approves nearly all requests, according to Justice Department data. In an annual report to Congress that is publicly available, the department said that in 2012 the government made 212 applications for access to business records, which is the same kind of request as that made of Verizon Communications Inc in the present case. The court denied none of the applications but amended 200 of them, the report said. The court also oversees applications for electronic surveillance and physical searches. There were 1,856 such applications in 2012, when all were approved except for one, which the government withdrew before the court could rule. Congress enacted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act setting up the court in 1978 amid concerns about the lack of legal oversight over the intelligence community’s activities. Activity by the U.S. intelligence community uncovered by congressional investigations included illegal mail-opening programs and the targeting of domestic protesters and political opponents by the Nixon administration. Now, critics say, the court set up to curb misconduct is rubber-stamping drastically expanded intelligence gathering efforts started after the September 11, 2001, attacks that prompt similar concerns about infringements on civil liberties. Government authority to obtain records was expanded further by the 2001 USA Patriot Act, which Congress passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in the immediate aftermath of the attacks. The government cited Section 215 of the Patriot Act in making its request in the Verizon case. This section allows the government to ask the court for “any tangible things” as part of any authorized investigation related to terrorism or intelligence activities. As the Justice Department wrote in an October 2011 letter to members of Congress, the government must show, among other things, that the information sought is “relevant to an authorized national security investigation.” At least one president has tried to sidestep the court. President George W. Bush’s administration chose not to ask the court to approve wiretapping of calls between suspected terrorists until 2007, news accounts of the program’s existence prompted controversy. This incident led to increased concerns among civil liberties advocates that the government effectively had a green light to invade the privacy of Americans.

The Obama administration has been keen to highlight how access to orders and opinions issued by the secret court is provided to members of both parties on the intelligence committees in both houses of Congress and on the Senate Judiciary Committee.

420,VZ,Verizon order casts spotlight on secretive U.S. surveillance court,"* Court set up to curb intelligence abuses * Judges appointed by chief justice * Congress briefed on court’s activities By Lawrence Hurley WASHINGTON, June 6 (Reuters) - The leak of a document showing the Obama administration asked for millions of phone records has turned a spotlight anew on a secretive U.S. federal court set up 35 years ago to curb intelligence abuses. Made up of 11 judges who serve staggered seven-year terms, it is called the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.  The judges’ identities are known, along with the name of the person who appoints them: the chief justice, now John Roberts.

421,VZ,WRAPUP 2-Obama administration defends massive phone record collection,"* Data on millions of Verizon customers targeted * Secret three-month court order published online * Privacy advocates say surveillance is overreach * Key U.S. lawmakers support the data collection effort By Mark Hosenball and John Whitesides WASHINGTON, June 6 (Reuters) - The Obama administration on Thursday defended its collection of the telephone records of millions of Americans as part of U.S. counterterrorism efforts, re-igniting a fierce debate over privacy even as it called the program critical to warding off an attack. The admission came after Britain’s Guardian newspaper published on Wednesday a secret court order authorizing the collection of phone records generated by millions of Verizon Communications customers. Privacy advocates blasted the order as unconstitutional government surveillance and called for a review of the program amid renewed concerns about intelligence-gathering efforts launched after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. The revelation also put a spotlight on the handling of intelligence and privacy issues by President Barack Obama’s administration, which already is under fire for searching the telephone records of Associated Press journalists and the emails and phone records of a Fox News Channel reporter as part of its inquiries into leaked government information. “The United States should not be accumulating phone records on tens of millions of innocent Americans. That is not what democracy is about. That is not what freedom is about,” said Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont. The White House said strict controls were in place to ensure the program did not violate civil liberties, and emphasized that the collection of data did not include listening to the calls. “The intelligence community is conducting court-authorized intelligence activities pursuant to public statute with the knowledge and oversight of Congress,” White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters. Republican Mike Rogers of Michigan, chairman of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, said the program did not abuse civil liberties and told reporters it had been used to stop a “significant” terrorist attack within the United States, but did not give details. “It’s called protecting America,” added Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee. Leading members of Congress said the program had been going on for seven years. The White House and U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said lawmakers were fully briefed. A senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the published court order pertained only to data such as a telephone number or the length of a call, not the subscribers’ identities or listening to the actual calls. The order requires Verizon to turn over to the National Security Agency “metadata” such as a list of numbers that called other U.S. or international numbers as well as other information on the time and location of calls. The NSA is the main U.S. intelligence-gathering agency tasked with monitoring electronic communications. “Information of the sort described in the Guardian article has been a critical tool in protecting the nation from terrorist threats to the United States, as it allows counterterrorism personnel to discover whether known or suspected terrorists have been in contact with other persons who may be engaged in terrorist activities, particularly people located inside the United States,” the senior administration official said. Verizon has declined to comment. It remains unclear whether the practice extends to other carriers, although several security experts and a U.S. official said that was likely. AT&T; Inc declined to comment. Representatives for other major carriers, including Sprint Nextel Corp and T-Mobile, could not be immediately reached or had no immediate comment. The three-month court order, dated April 25, directs Verizon’s Business Network Services Inc and Verizon Business Services units to hand over daily electronic data until July 19. It was issued one week after U.S. law enforcement officials tracked down the two brothers accused of carrying out the deadly Boston Marathon bombing. Investigators in that case had been looking into calls made from their phones and had been searching for one brother’s laptop computer. A U.S. official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said this particular surveillance order was not issued in reaction to the April 15 bombing. The April order compels Verizon to turn over both international calling records and domestic records, and refers to mobile and landline numbers, according to the Guardian’s copy, which was labeled “top secret” and issued by the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The four-page document does not lay out why the order was given or whether it was linked to any specific investigation. Thursday’s admission highlights the ongoing and controversial campaign of domestic surveillance launched under Republican President George W. Bush’s administration after the 2001 attacks. A 2001 U.S. law known as the Patriot Act allows the FBI to seek an order to obtain “any tangible thing,” including business records, to gather intelligence. The senior administration official said that “there is a robust legal regime in place governing all activities” like the one outlined in the order and that “all three branches of government are involved in reviewing and authorizing intelligence collection.” But the order raised questions about what authorities hoped to learn by sorting through the phone data. Terrorism financing expert Jimmy Gurulé, a former assistant U.S. attorney general and now a law professor at University of Notre Dame, said the order goes too far. “The question is how the phone data of tens of millions of Americans is ‘relevant’ to a terrorism investigation. This is clearly an overreach by the NSA and an apparent rubber stamp by the FISA court,” Gurulé said. It was unclear if members of Congress knew the scope of the data collection. Republican Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois told Holder at a public hearing on the Justice Department’s budget that he was concerned the program could be used to obtain the phone records of members of Congress or the U.S. Supreme Court. “There has been no intention to do anything of that nature, that is to spy on members of Congress, to spy on members of the Supreme Court,” Holder said, although he added he could not get into specifics of the program in public. Administration and congressional officials said members of the House and Senate intelligence committees had been briefed in detail about collection activities on multiple occasions. One official said the intelligence panels also provided information on the program to any other lawmaker who sought it. “If we didn’t do it, we’d be crazy,” Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said of data collection. The American Civil Liberties Union, among other groups, called on Congress to investigate the scope of the effort, which it labeled “alarming” and “unconstitutional.” “It’s a program in which some untold number of innocent people have been put under the constant surveillance of government agents,” the ACLU’s Jameel Jaffer said.

422,VZ,Congress was briefed on Verizon records: Attorney general,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Attorney General Eric Holder said on Thursday that members of Congress were fully briefed on the intelligence-gathering program that included the daily collection of telephone records from Verizon Communications. Holder, the chief law enforcement official, said it would not be appropriate for him to say anything more in a public forum about the program. Britain’s Guardian newspaper published on Wednesday a secret court order related to the collection of records of millions of Verizon customers. Holder spoke to senators during a previously scheduled hearing on the Justice Department’s budget. Earlier in the day, the Obama administration defended its collection of a massive amount of telephone records as part of U.S. counterterrorism efforts to protect Americans from attacks. Republican Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois, who questioned Holder about the program, said he was concerned that spy agencies might have obtained the phone records of Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court, even if by accident. “When government bureaucrats are sloppy, they usually are really sloppy,” Kirk said. Holder responded that he could not get into specifics in public, but added, “There has been no intention to do anything of that nature - that is, to spy on members of Congress, to spy on members of the Supreme Court.” The program appears to have involved the records of millions of Americans, re-igniting a debate over privacy rights. Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, defended the program at the hearing, calling it essential to preventing attacks on Americans. “I hope the American people appreciate that we’re at war, because I sure do,” Graham said.

426,VZ,UPDATE 1-U.S. NSA is collecting phone records of Verizon customers -report,"* Order issued by Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court * Officials at White House, NSA decline to comment By Joseph Menn and Sinead Carew SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK, June 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. National Security Agency is collecting telephone records of millions of Verizon Communications customers, according to a secret court order obtained and published by the Guardian newspaper’s website. The order marked “Top Secret” and issued by the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court directs Verizon’s Business Network Services Inc and Verizon Business Services units to hand over electronic data including all calling records on an “ongoing, daily basis” until the order expires on July 19, 2013. The order can be seen at: Signed by Judge Roger Vinson at the request of the FBI, the order covers each phone number dialed by all customers and location and routing data, along with the duration and frequency of the calls, but not the contents of the communications. The disclosure comes as the Obama administration is already under fire on other privacy and First Amendment issues. In particular, it is being criticized for a search of Associated Press journalists’ calling records and the emails of a Fox television reporter in leak inquiries. Officials at the White House and the NSA declined immediate comment. Verizon spokesman Ed McFadden declined to comment. Verizon’s biggest rival, AT&T; Inc, did not provide any immediate comment when asked if the government had made a similar request for its data. “That’s not the society we’ve built in the United States,” said Kurt Opsahl, an attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which is suing the NSA over surveillance inside the country. “It’s not the society we set forth in the Constitution, and it’s not the society we should have.” The order expressly compels Verizon to turn over both international calling records and strictly domestic records, and it forbids disclosure of the order’s existence. It refers to mobile and landline numbers, though not explicitly to Verizon’s consumer business. The order is the first concrete evidence that U.S. intelligence officials are continuing a broad campaign of domestic surveillance that began under President George W. Bush and caused great controversy when it was first exposed. In 2005, the New York Times reported that the NSA was wiretapping Americans without warrants on international calls. Los Angeles Times and USA Today later reported that the agency also had unchecked access to records on domestic calls. In addition, a former AT&T; technician, Mark Klein, said that a room accessible only with NSA clearance in the carrier’s main San Francisco hub received perfect copies of all transmissions. Privacy lawsuits against the government are continuing, though cases filed against the phone carriers were dismissed after Congress passed a 2008 law immunizing the companies that complied with government requests. That law also allowed for broader information-seeking, though methods must be approved by the special court handling foreign intelligence matters. The new order cites legal language from the 2001 U.S. Patriot Act, passed soon after the Sept. 11 attacks, that allows the FBI to seek an order to obtain “any tangible thing,” including business records, in pursuit of “foreign intelligence information.” Verizon is the second biggest U.S. telephone company behind AT&T; in terms of revenue. The vast majority of Verizon’s overseas operations come from its acquisition of MCI Communications, which is also covered by the order although foreign-to-foreign calls are exempted from it. Opsahl said it was unlikely that Verizon would be the only subject of such an order and that the other major carriers probably had similar orders against them. It is unclear what the NSA and FBI do with the phone records they collect. If past practices have continued, though, Opsahl said, they are probably mined with sophisticated software in an attempt to figure out close connections between people the agencies consider to be terrorism suspects and their associates.",6062013,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-wiretaps-verizon/update-1-u-s-nsa-is-collecting-phone-records-of-verizon-customers-report-idUSL1N0EI01S20130606

430,VZ,U.S. court to hear oral arguments in net neutrality case on September 9,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The federal appeals court in Washington on Tuesday set September 9 as the date for oral arguments in the so-called net neutrality case that could be seminal for federal regulation of Internet traffic. The highly anticipated hearings, originally expected to take place this past spring, will pit Verizon Communications Inc against the Federal Communications Commission as the biggest U.S. wireless provider challenges the FCC’s order that guides how Internet service providers manage their networks. The ruling of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit will have major implications for the increasingly partisan debate over the degree of regulatory power possessed by the federal communications agency. Net neutrality is the principle that Internet users should be able to access any Web content and use any applications they choose, without restrictions or varying charges imposed by the Internet service provider or the government. Judges Judith Rogers, Laurence Silberman and David Tatel will hear the arguments in the case, according to the order issued on Tuesday. The FCC’s 2011 open Internet rules require Internet providers to treat all Web traffic equally and give consumers equal access to all lawful content, even if, for instance, it comes from a competitor or disagrees with their political views. Verizon and other critics argue that the FCC’s rules are an unwarranted government intrusion into regulating the Internet, including which content consumers may access and which companies may provide that content, and should be thrown out. Public interest groups have criticized the rules as too weak, saying the FCC was swayed by big industry players. Democrats on Capitol Hill have said they would push against the court’s decision if it sides with Verizon. The FCC’s position in the case received a boost from the Supreme Court in May, when in a separate case it ruled in favor of giving regulatory agencies deference in interpreting the extent of their own regulatory authority.

434,VZ,UPDATE 1-Verizon makes bid for Wind to get Canada market foothold,"* Initial offer for Wind in $600 mln-$800 mln range -source * Startups have struggled to compete with dominant players * Upcoming 700 MHz auction key to market as data booms By Alastair Sharp and Euan Rocha TORONTO, June 26 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc  has offered to buy Canadian telecommunications startup Wind Mobile and is also in talks with rival startup Mobilicity as it makes proposals that could create a viable competitor to the three wireless operators that now dominate the Canadian market. One source familiar with the matter said Verizon presented a tentative offer of $600 million to $800 million for Wind Mobile last week, with final pricing depending on its due diligence. The U.S. telecom giant has also approached rival startup Mobilicity and may be interested in acquiring that struggling wireless player as well, a second source said. Stocks of Canada’s three big telecoms players tumbled on the Toronto Stock Exchange as the market digested what could be a game-changing development in what has been a cozy domestic market. Telus Corp fell 7.8 percent to C$30.75, Rogers Communications lost 9 percent to C$41.77, and BCE Inc  was down 4.1 percent at C$41.54. Mobilicity, Wind and Public Mobile, the three startups that emerged from a 2008 government auction of spectrum, entered the market with cheap talk-and-text plans that pressured the existing players. But they struggled to compete, and Mobilicity debtholders are set to vote on a recapitalization plan early next week. Activity in the sector has stepped up since the government lifted curbs on the foreign ownership of new entrants last year, and a number of players are now jockeying to strike deals ahead of a second big auction, of coveted 700 mHz spectrum, which requires fewer towers than higher-frequency airwaves. Sources familiar with the situation say that all three of the juniors have attracted offers from the Canadian incumbents. But the government wants to boost competition, and Ottawa has made it clear that it does not want the startups to go to existing players. Earlier this month, it quashed Telus’s bid for Mobilicity by blocking the transfer of Mobilicity’s spectrum licenses to Telus. A bid from Verizon would likely be far more tempting to Ottawa, given that it would create a player able to boost competition across the country. Verizon declined comment. Last week, however, Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo confirmed publicly that Verizon was interested in entering the Canadian market. A Wind spokeswoman and a Mobilicity spokesman both declined to comment. Any new entrants will want to clarify their ownership before Sept. 17, the deadline to apply for the 700 megahertz spectrum auction, which is due to start on Jan. 14. The rules of that auction preclude talks between bidding parties after an initial expression of interest. There are seven blocks available in the auction, but bidders will likely covet four that are aligned with the spectrum bought by AT&T; and Verizon in the United States. The government has said BCE, Telus and Rogers can only obtain one of these prime blocks each, leaving new entrants and regional cable operators such as Quebecor Inc and Shaw Communications to compete for the fourth. Verizon is already using 700 MHz airwaves in the United States to build a network capable of handling use of heavy data such as streaming video. Acquiring the same spectrum in Canada would let Verizon buy high-end devices at a discount. Ottawa aims to raise a minimum of C$900 million in the 700 MHz auction, but the sale is expected to rake in far more than that as carriers jostle for the bandwidth upon which their networks depend. The 2008 auction of spectrum in the 1700 MHz range brought in more than C$4 billion for the government.

436,VZ,"Verizon bids for Canada's Wind, talks with Mobilicity-sources","TORONTO, June 26 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc  has offered to buy Canadian telecommunications startup Wind Mobile and is also in talks with rival startup Mobilicity over a potential deal, according to sources familiar with the situation. Verizon came forward with a tentative offer for Wind last week with an offer of $600 million to $800 million, with more specific pricing pending due diligence, said one source familiar with the situation. The offer comes as a subsidiary of European telecoms company Vimpelcom Ltd withdrew its bid to take control of Wind Mobile from its founder and chief executive, Anthony Lacavera, a move that had created uncertainty about the future of the upstart Canadian wireless company. Verizon has also approached rival Canadian startup Mobilicity and may be interested in acquiring the struggling wireless player, said another source familiar with the matter. Verizon’s entry would create a potentially powerful rival to BCE Inc, Telus Corp and Rogers Communications Inc. The three companies are the dominant players in the Canadian wireless market, where prices have traditionally been higher than in the United States. The Globe and Mail, citing unnamed sources, reported earlier on Wednesday that Verizon had made an opening offer for Wind worth roughly C$700 million ($665.87 million). It also said the company was in talks rival Mobilicity. Verizon declined to comment on the matter.

439,VZ,"Verizon quarterly revenue misses estimate, shares drop","(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc said strength in its wireless business was tempered by weakness in its traditional wireline unit, producing softer-than-expected revenue growth for the quarter and sending its shares down nearly 2 percent. The telecommunications company said on Thursday that corporate and government customers were cutting costs, partly offsetting better-than-estimated wireless customer growth. Also, wireless profit margins were hurt by higher costs. While analysts described the results as solid, they noted investors would have liked better news since Verizon shares had risen more than 17 percent since the end of 2012 in anticipation of strong growth prospects. “The results were very good but at these valuations even very good might not be good enough,” said Moffett Research analyst Craig Moffett. Some of Verizon’s strong valuation has been due to investor expectations it would be able to increase its earnings by buying out Vodafone Group Plc’s 45 percent stake in their Verizon Wireless venture. But Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo did not address the matter during his earnings call. “Their silence on the topic of buying in the Vodafone stake could be disappointing to some investors,” Moffett said. In an interview with Reuters, Shammo declined to comment on the prospects for a Vodafone deal. The executive said about 60 percent of its decline in wireline revenue was due to shrinking government spending while the rest came from corporate spending cuts. He added that he was not expecting any big turnaround for the rest of the year. While operating revenue rose 4.3 percent at $29.8 billion from $28.55 billion, it was shy of estimates of $29.83 billion according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Its wireless profit margin came to 49.8 percent, based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which was below five analyst estimates between 50 percent and 50.9 percent. Evercore analyst Jonathan Schildkraut noted that higher-than-expected wireless customer departures, known in the industry as churn, would have increased the company’s costs. Verizon reported churn of 0.93 percent, compared with his expectations for 0.9 percent. Verizon may have lost some customers to No. 4 U.S. wireless provider T-Mobile US Inc, according to Moffett. T-Mobile US is pushing hard to stem customer net losses by aggressive cost-cutting and marketing. NOT A ‘BLOW-DOWN-THE DOORS’ QUARTER Analysts said ahead of the earnings report that they expect Verizon, the first of the U.S. telecommunications companies to report second-quarter results, to take the lion’s share of mobile customer growth in the quarter. But they also expect competition to get tougher as the year progresses because No. 3 U.S. mobile service provider Sprint Corp, which was recently bought by Japan’s SoftBank Corp, may be able to compete much better with the help of SoftBank’s investments. On the plus side, Verizon Wireless, the biggest U.S. mobile service provider, added 941,000 subscribers in the second quarter, which compared well with the average expectation for 836,500 from six analysts contacted by Reuters. Estimates ranged from 700,000 to 909,000. It also forecast that net subscriber additions would increase sequentially in the remaining two quarters of 2013. “It wasn’t a blow-the-doors-down quarter, but it was a solid quarter,” said Schildkraut, who was impressed with Verizon’s customer growth. “It’s an expensive stock and they need to do a lot to support that.” Excluding a pension-related gain, Verizon said it earned 73 cents per share, compared with expectations for 72 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Verizon said it increased its capital spending budget to between $16.4 billion and $16.6 billion for the full year, compared with its previous target of $16.2 billion. The company said it will need to spend more as it anticipates higher demand for wireless data services, and will have to start using a new chunk of wireless airwaves. Verizon added 161,000 net new FiOS Internet customers and 140,000 net new FiOS video connections in the quarter. Verizon’s earnings rose to $2.25 billion, or 78 cents per share, from $1.83 billion, or 64 cents, in the year-ago quarter. AT&T; Inc, the No. 2 U.S. mobile provider, is scheduled to report earnings on July 23, and Sprint is due to report on July 30.

443,VZ,Telus challenges Ottawa's wireless policy in court,"TORONTO, July 30 (Reuters) - The battle between Canada’s three large wireless carriers and the Canadian government escalated on Monday with one of the incumbents, Telus Corp , taking the government to court over a recent decision over the transfer of spectrum licenses. Telus said in filings with the Federal Court in Ottawa that it is seeking clarity on the legality of the government’s decision last month, which potentially changes the rules around transferring bandwidth rights between carriers. The challenge is the latest salvo fired against the government which is seeking to boost competition in the sector to bring down average bills for Canadian consumers. Telus, Rogers Communications and BCE Inc  say the government is giving an edge to foreign wireless majors like Verizon Communications Inc, which have expressed an interest in entering the Canadian market. The three incumbents, which between them own a huge stable of media assets across Canada, have launched a wide-ranging lobbying and public relations campaign to back their case that rates charged by Canadian wireless companies are lower than those of U.S. rivals. In June the government effectively foiled Telus’s C$380 million ($370 million) bid for struggling Canadian wireless start-up Mobilicity by blocking the transfer of spectrum licenses. It also indicated it would not allow spectrum owned by Mobilicity and slightly larger rival Wind Mobile to fall into the hands of the incumbents, if such deals resulted in undue spectrum concentration in the hands of a few. Telus says this could put billions of dollars of investment at risk, cost Canadian jobs and result in foreign companies being given advantages over local companies. Sources have confirmed to Reuters that U.S. wireless giant Verizon has made a bid for Wind Mobile and that it is also in talks with Mobilicity. Telus argues that when Mobilicity and Wind bought their spectrum, they did so under the understanding they could sell those licenses to the incumbents after five years. “The minister did not have the statutory power to interfere with those vested rights,” Telus said in its court filing. A spokesperson for the government was not immediately reachable for comment.

444,VZ,UPDATE 2-Rogers designs plan to thwart Verizon move into Canada,"By Alastair Sharp and Euan Rocha TORONTO, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Rogers Communications Inc , Canada’s largest wireless company, is attempting to thwart Verizon Communications Inc’s entry into the country by backing a private equity bid for two small carriers that the U.S. telecom giant wants to acquire. According to sources familiar with the deal, Rogers wants to help Toronto-based Birch Hill Equity Partners fund a purchase of controlling stakes in Wind Mobile and Mobilicity, which entered the Canadian market less than five years ago. The plan would complicate a Verizon bid, perhaps pushing the company to raise its offer price, but industry insiders say that is far from assured Rogers and Birch Hill would win approval from the federal government. Ottawa has repeatedly stressed that it wants to boost competition and lower wireless bills for consumers, and it has set rules in recent auctions of wireless airwaves designed to encourage new carriers to offer services. Rogers - along with Canada’s other major national telecoms  BCE Inc and Telus Corp - argue that Verizon would unfairly benefit from the policies to stimulate competition. Those policies include a 2012 easing of restrictions on foreign ownership for smaller operators. In keeping with its goals, Ottawa has opposed efforts by the Big Three to win control of airwaves owned by any recent entrants, and government policy prevents Rogers from making a direct big for Wind or Mobilicity. Rogers, Telus and BCE’s Bell currently control 90 percent of the market and 85 percent of the spectrum. The Rogers-Birch Hill plan, initially reported by the Globe and Mail newspaper on Friday, is designed to circumvent those restrictions. The company would take no ownership in Wind and Mobilicity and would not control spectrum owned by them. Instead, the deal is structured to give Rogers access to the airwaves through a commercial agreement. Even so, sources working with the industry but not directly involved in the deal said Ottawa would likely block any deals that result in “undue concentration,” a concern sure to arise from the proposal. “We believe there is a low likelihood that Industry Canada would approve any structure involving significant funding from an incumbent and/or an incumbent being the major pro-forma customer of a new entrant,” Macquarie analyst Greg MacDonald wrote in a short note to clients. A government official declined to comment directly on the proposed deal, pointing instead to a policy framework released in June that would frame the government’s thinking on any sales. James Moore, who took over as industry minister in a July cabinet reshuffle, made clear on Wednesday that the government has no intention of tweaking its rules governing the wireless sector. That includes restrictions on the transfer of spectrum and limits on how much spectrum the three dominant carriers can buy in an upcoming auction. Verizon has been in talks to buy both companies and use them, and the spectrum they control, as a stepping stone into Canada, sources told Reuters in June. Mobilicity has said it has received interest from several parties since delaying a vote on a recapitalization last month,  but declined to comment on any particular potential buyer. Verizon and Rogers declined to comment. A spokesperson for Wind Mobile declined to comment on the report, saying it was business as usual there. Rogers and Birch Hill have done business together in the past. In 2010, Birch Hill sold Kitchener, Ontario-based Atria Networks, the owner of fiber optic cable, to Rogers and it made some C$355 million ($342.42 million) on the deal after debt. Two of the private equity firm’s partners are also former top executives at Rogers. The firm has C$2 billion in capital under management and it typically focuses on mid-market deals in the C$30 million to C$600 million range. The upcoming spectrum auction precludes parties with bids to enter takeover discussions or network sharing deals while the months-lone process is underway. The deadline for initial bids is Sept 17. Auction rules allow BCE, Telus and Rogers to bid for only one of the four prime blocks apiece, and two of the seven blocks available in total. Smaller players such as Wind, Mobilicity and Public Mobile, regional providers such as Quebecor’s  Videotron or a large new entrant like Verizon, may bid for up to two of the four prime blocks. In considering approval of any proposed deals, Ottawa has indicated that it would also examine the overall distribution of licenses in a single region, how a change in ownership would affect services and other factors.

449,VZ,UPDATE 3-Time Warner Cable offers unconventional deal to end CBS blackout,"* Time Warner Cable offers risky a la carte proposal * CBS calls offer a “sham,” “empty gesture” * Verizon FiOS seeing increase in requests from Time Warner Cable customers By Liana B. Baker and Sinead Carew Aug 5 (Reuters) - Time Warner Cable Inc Chief Executive Glenn Britt sent a letter to CBS Corp CEO Les Moonves on Monday offering a controversial new proposal to end the blackout of CBS shows in large TV markets including New York and Los Angeles. Britt proposed selling CBS to customers as a single channel on an “a la carte” basis, an idea dismissed by CBS as a “sham.” The exchange was the latest development in a contentious public battle between the No. 1 rated U.S. broadcast network and the No. 2 cable provider that has left millions of customers unable to watch the summer hit “Under the Dome” and live sports that airs on CBS such as golf. As the blackout that began late Friday stretched into its third day, rival TV provider Verizon FiOS said it was receiving requests for service from Time Warner Cable customers who couldn’t watch CBS. To end the standoff, Britt said Time Warner Cable could offer customers the chance to pay for the CBS network “a la carte,” an idea viewed as risky in the U.S. cable industry. “Rather than our debating the point, we would allow customers to decide for themselves how much value they ascribe to CBS programming,” Britt said. CBS, meanwhile, called the proposal “a sham” and “a public relations vehicle designed to distract from the fact that Time Warner Cable is not negotiating in good faith.” Time Warner said it was “disappointed” by a “lack of responsiveness” from CBS. “Our efforts to get CBS programming back for our customers are sincere, and we have offered two proposals to accomplish that, while CBS has offered nothing in return,” the company said in a statement. Media companies like CBS sell packages of channels to operators, a common practice in the cable industry. CBS cable channels such as Showtime also went dark in the dispute with Time Warner Cable because the company negotiates its programming deals in one bundle. Letting customers cherry pick the channels they want could cut revenue of media companies. Needham & Co estimated in July that the cable industry including media content providers could lose 50 percent of its revenue, about $70 billion, if the a la carte was widely adopted. Time Warner Cable said CBS could choose the price for the a la carte channels and the broadcaster could collect all the revenue. This is not the first time Time Warner Cable has used this tactic. In 2007, Britt offered to sell NFL games separately to customers when his company could not agree to terms to carry the NFL Network cable channel. “A la carte is never going to happen,” BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield said. CBS added that “anyone familiar with the entertainment business knows the economics and structure of the cable industry doesn’t work that way and isn’t likely to for some time.” Time Warner Cable also offered to increase the fees it would to pay to CBS but it did not elaborate on the specifics. RBC Capital Markets analyst David Bank estimates that CBS currently receives $1 per month, per subscriber and is seeking to double that to $2 per subscriber. The latest proposal from Time Warner Cable would not include digital rights, which it said CBS had provided to other cable companies. Those rights include CBS’s premium channel Showtime’s digital app, which competes with HBO GO, said a source familiar with the matter. FiOS READY Recent history shows these fights can hurt pay TV providers, who lose subscribers when they sign with rivals. Last summer, satellite operator DirecTV said its cancellation rate increased when Viacom’s networks including Nickelodeon and MTV went dark for 10 days. Cablevision blamed its 15-day blackout of Fox in 2010, which deprived its customers of most of the World Series, for its loss of many of the 35,000 subscribers during that quarter. Verizon FiOS, one of Time Warner Cable’s fiercest competitors in New York, said it was receiving “an increasing number of requests for service from Time Warner Cable customers unable to watch CBS content.” Verizon spokesman Bill Kula did not specify how many Time Warner Cable subscribers had contacted FiOS. He said that FiOS, a fiber based service that competes with cable operators for television, Internet and telephone customers, feels “very well positioned to take advantage of the situation.” Verizon’s FiOS service has been one of Time Warner Cable’s biggest threats in New York, and has made serious inroads against the cable company in local markets such as Staten Island, said Moffett research analyst Craig Moffett. He estimated that Time Warner Cable competes with FiOS in about 14 percent of its footprint nationally, with about half of that overlap from their head to head competition in New York City. FiOS also has a presence in Dallas, another Time Warner Cable market that is blacking out CBS. ISI analyst Vijay Jayant said Time Warner Cable will lose some customers in the dispute but it is too early to tell how many will depart.",8052013,http://www.reuters.com/article/timewarner-cbs-letter/update-3-time-warner-cable-offers-unconventional-deal-to-end-cbs-blackout-idUSL1N0G612W20130805

The government - which has a policy of trying to increase wireless competition - expects to raise billions of dollars from the January 2014 auction of the spectrum that telecoms companies need to operate their wireless services. “We have every intention of continuing that policy in the interests of Canadian consumers and the broad Canadian public, including proceeding with the auction as we have laid out for some time,” Harper told reporters in Miramichi, New Brunswick. Under the rules of the auction, Canada’s three dominant players - Rogers Communications Inc, BCE Inc and Telus Corp - may each only bid for one of four prime blocks of spectrum, while other companies may bid for two apiece. The big three, already unhappy that Verizon may be set up a Canadian operation, say the auction rules would unfairly favor the U.S. company. They have launched a high-profile public relations campaign to persuade Ottawa to change its mind. “I understand full well where some of these big companies are coming from. They’re important parts of the Canadian economy and they have a responsibility to protect their profits, protect their bottom lines for their shareholders,” Harper said. “At the same time, the government has a responsibility towards a wider public interest, and Canadians are very clear about what that wider public interest is to us.

452,VZ,Birch Hill lobbies Canada on investment in wireless carriers,"* Private equity fund registers to lobby government * Sources say Rogers backs Birch Hill bid to thwart Verizon * BCE accuses Ottawa of arrogance * Industry minister accuses Big Three of dishonest campaign By Randall Palmer OTTAWA, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Birch Hill Equity Partners Inc, a Canadian private equity fund, has registered to lobby Ottawa over investment in wireless carriers, lending credence to the idea it wants to buy two small wireless firms and elbow aside a possible move into the Canadian market by Verizon Communications Inc. Sources have tipped Birch Hill as a possible bidder for controlling stakes in small players Wind Mobile and Mobilicity, two newcomers in the market, with financial help from market leader Rogers Communications Inc.. Birch Hill registered with the federal Registry of Lobbyists () on Aug. 8 with plans to lobby the prime minister’s office and the Industry Department on the topic “Telecommunications Policy Framework with regard to investment in wireless carriers in Canada”. The Toronto-based fund was not available to comment on Wednesday. Canada’s Conservative government and the Big Three Canadian phone companies - Rogers, BCE Inc and Telus Corp  - are embroiled in an increasingly nasty and public dispute over telecom sector rules that the government says are designed to boost competition and the companies say favor Verizon’s entry. Verizon has declined to comment in detail on any plans for Canada, but sources familiar with the matter have said the U.S. company has offered to buy Wind Mobile for $600 million to $800 million, and is in talks to acquire Mobilicity. Under current rules, the Big Three are not allowed to acquire the two small players’ spectrum, as it was intended for new entrants. Also, in an auction of spectrum next year, Rogers, BCE and Telus are each limited to bidding on one of four prime blocks of spectrum, whereas new entrants, including Verizon, may bid for two. In a high-profile lobbying and advertising campaign, the three companies say the rules will cost Canadian jobs, and BCE board member Anthony Fell said on Tuesday that new Industry Minister James Moore had been disrespectful in allocating only half an hour apiece to talk with the phone company bosses. “To be frank, there is an arrogance about both the ministry and the department, which I believe is inappropriate,” he wrote in an open letter to Prime Minister Stephen Harper. In response, Moore accused Fell of engaging in “misinformation,” and blasted “dishonest attempts to skew debates via misleading campaigns”. () The companies say they have no plans to stop their lobbying. “We think this is an important issue for Canadians. We’ll continue to work to make sure they understand the consequences of current government rules, which give an unfair advantage to large foreign players,” Rogers spokeswoman Terrie Tweddle said. But it is far from certain that the government would approve any bid from Birch Hill, given Ottawa’s focus on trying to drum up new competition to force the three dominant players to lower cellphone fees. The Globe and Mail newspaper said on Wednesday that Verizon and Canadian officials held “exploratory talks” in Ottawa on May 21 about wireless opportunities, and the phone companies say Canadian officials also went to New York to court Verizon. Asked for comment, Moore’s spokeswoman, Jessica Fletcher, would say only that departmental officials regularly meet telecom representatives.",8142013,http://www.reuters.com/article/canada-telecoms/birch-hill-lobbies-canada-on-investment-in-wireless-carriers-idUSL2N0GF1LQ20130814

456,VZ,Canadian telecom stocks rise as Verizon said to delay entry,"TORONTO, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Shares in two of Canada’s biggest wireless telephone companies rose roughly 5 percent on Thursday as doubts emerged about whether U.S. giant Verizon Communications still plans to expand across its northern border. Rogers Communications, the Canada market leader with some 9 million wireless customers, and Telus Corp, which has more than 7 million, gained sharply while the third major operator, BCE Inc, rose 1.8 percent by mid-afternoon. Sources told Reuters in June that Verizon had offered between $600 million and $800 million for wireless newcomer Wind Mobile and was also in talks with another struggling upstart, Mobilicity. But the Globe and Mail newspaper reported late on Wednesday that Verizon now planned to focus on an auction of coveted wireless airwaves due early next year before deciding whether to proceed with the acquisitions. Verizon, Wind and Mobilicity declined comment on Thursday. Desjardins analyst Maher Yaghi said the report of a delay could mean either that Verizon wants to see how much the airwaves cost before it commits to buying the companies - possibly extracting a better price - or that an established operator has offered them a compelling deal on roaming rates, making the company reconsider its entire interest in Canada. “The new development lessens the odds of Verizon entering Canada; however, it does not eliminate this possibility completely,” he said in a note to clients in which he pointed to 20 percent upside for Rogers, Telus and BCE if Verizon does not enter Canada and up to 25 percent downside if they do. RBC Capital Markets analyst Drew McReynolds said investors were, as of Wednesday’s closing stock prices for the main players, assuming a 60 to 70 percent chance that Verizon comes. The auction for 700 MHz spectrum is due to start in January, with a deadline to express interest next month. The auction is expected to raise billions for a federal government that has actively encouraged involvement from new entrants, including Verizon, as a way to stoke competition. The possible Verizon delay could exert pressure on the sellers of Wind and Mobilicity to agree to a lower price, and on the government to maintain or even improve the regulatory framework, a source involved in the process said. The established operators have mounted a massive campaign against those rules, which they say unduly benefit Verizon and other foreign companies that dwarf them. Telus was trading $1.53 higher on the day at C$32.28, Rogers was up C$1.84 at C$42.27, and BCE gained 76 Canadian cents to C$42.54 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

Verizon had tabled a $700 million preliminary offer for Wind Mobile and signed a non-disclosure agreement with Mobilicty in recent months, it said. This month Rogers Communications Inc, Canada’s largest wireless company, attempted to thwart Verizon’s entry into the country by backing a private equity bid for the two carriers.

462,VZ,Canada's telecoms to change tack in anti-Verizon crusade: sources,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada’s three biggest wireless companies plan to attack Verizon Communications Inc’s role in the U.S. government’s electronic spying scandal, as they scramble to force Ottawa to rethink rules that encourage Verizon to set up in Canada, according to four sources. The Canadian government has so far spurned an intense lobbying effort from the trio - Rogers Communications, BCE Inc and Telus Corp - by insisting its policies will cut Canadians’ wireless bills. The planned campaign, which has yet to get a final green light, will focus on how Verizon’s entry into Canada could open the door to overreaching surveillance and a loss of privacy for Canadians, said the sources, who declined to be named as the plans are not yet public. If the companies sign off on the proposals, the ads will start appearing in newspapers, online and on radio next week in the hope that they will swing public opinion behind the three players and persuade the government to change its mind. Telus, BCE and Rogers declined to comment on any changes to the campaign. Under current rules, new entrant Verizon could bid in a 2014 auction for two of four prime blocks of the spectrum that wireless companies need to operate mobile services, while the existing big players can only bid for one block apiece. Verizon can also buy one or more of the smaller telecom firms, an option that is not open for the three Canadian firms. Sources told Reuters in June that Verizon had offered between $600 million and $800 million for newcomer Wind Mobile and was in talks with another upstart, Mobilicity. Verizon has said only that it is exploring the possibility of a Canadian entry. Lobbyists, advisers and insiders at the three big firms concede that their current blitz of ads about the need for a “level playing field” in the spectrum auction has not convinced Ottawa to change its mind. “They’re either going to have to fold their tents and live with this, or win the fight,” said a source familiar with the new campaign. “If they are going to win the fight they obviously need much more aggressive tactics.” The three firms between them control 90 percent of the Canadian mobile market, and they struggle to win sympathy from consumers looking at often lower U.S. costs. “There’s enough negative feedback about the campaign coming in that they’re scrambling for new messages,” said a second source close to one of the established operators. Verizon was named in documents released by fugitive former U.S. spy agency contractor Edward Snowden that detailed electronic spying operations by the U.S. National Security Agency, including a vast log of phone calls by its customers. The Canadian government says it will stick with its rules, which it says are designed to ensure that there are four major wireless operators across Canada. On Friday the ruling Conservative Party launched www.consumersfirst.ca website to press its case and push back against the telecom companies’ own site www.fairforcanada.ca. With a potentially grueling election campaign ahead for the Conservative Party in a year or two, lobbyists and lawyers believe the government could back down if it senses public opinion is moving away from it.

463,VZ,Canada's telecoms to change tack in anti-Verizon crusade -sources,"* Rogers, BCE and Telus to point to privacy concerns after NSA leaks * Campaign for ‘fairness’ so far fallen on deaf ears * Canadian government says won’t change its telecom policy By Alastair Sharp and Euan Rocha TORONTO, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Canada’s three biggest wireless companies plan to attack Verizon Communications Inc’s  role in the U.S. government’s electronic spying scandal, as they scramble to force Ottawa to rethink rules that encourage Verizon to set up in Canada, according to four sources. The Canadian government has so far spurned an intense lobbying effort from the trio - Rogers Communications, BCE Inc and Telus Corp - by insisting its policies will cut Canadians’ wireless bills. The planned campaign, which has yet to get a final green light, will focus on how Verizon’s entry into Canada could open the door to overreaching surveillance and a loss of privacy for Canadians, said the sources, who declined to be named as the plans are not yet public. If the companies sign off on the proposals, the ads will start appearing in newspapers, online and on radio next week in the hope that they will swing public opinion behind the three players and persuade the government to change its mind. Telus, BCE and Rogers declined to comment on any changes to the campaign. Under current rules, new entrant Verizon could bid in a 2014 auction for two of four prime blocks of the spectrum that wireless companies need to operate mobile services, while the existing big players can only bid for one block apiece. Verizon can also buy one or more of the smaller telecom firms, an option that is not open for the three Canadian firms. Sources told Reuters in June that Verizon had offered between $600 million and $800 million for newcomer Wind Mobile and was in talks with another upstart, Mobilicity. Verizon has said only that it is exploring the possibility of a Canadian entry. Lobbyists, advisers and insiders at the three big firms concede that their current blitz of ads about the need for a “level playing field” in the spectrum auction has not convinced Ottawa to change its mind. “They’re either going to have to fold their tents and live with this, or win the fight,” said a source familiar with the new campaign. “If they are going to win the fight they obviously need much more aggressive tactics.” The three firms between them control 90 percent of the Canadian mobile market, and they struggle to win sympathy from consumers looking at often lower U.S. costs. “There’s enough negative feedback about the campaign coming in that they’re scrambling for new messages,” said a second source close to one of the established operators. Verizon was named in documents released by fugitive former U.S. spy agency contractor Edward Snowden that detailed electronic spying operations by the U.S. National Security Agency, including a vast log of phone calls by its customers. The Canadian government says it will stick with its rules, which it says are designed to ensure that there are four major wireless operators across Canada. On Friday the ruling Conservative Party launched  www.consumersfirst.ca website to press its case and push back against the telecom companies’ own site www.fairforcanada.ca. With a potentially grueling election campaign ahead for the Conservative Party in a year or two, lobbyists and lawyers believe the government could back down if it senses public opinion is moving away from it. But a fiercer bidding war could also boost the government’s take in the spectrum auction, making it easier for Ottawa to balance its books ahead of the October 2015 federal election. The deadline for bidders to register for the auction is Sept. 17, and the auction is due to start on Jan. 14 next year.",8162013,http://www.reuters.com/article/canada-telecoms/canadas-telecoms-to-change-tack-in-anti-verizon-crusade-sources-idUSL2N0GH10P20130816
464,VZ,UPDATE 1-T-Mobile USA connects with buyers,"By Danielle Robinson and Joy Ferguson NEW YORK, Aug 16 (IFR) - T-Mobile USA CEO John Legere’s no holds-barred approach to attacking the wireless stronghold of dominant duo AT&T; and Verizon in the US is working its magic in the bond markets. This week, about 150 bond investors poured several billions of dollars into T-Mobile USA’s order book for a USD500m five-year non-call two offering, despite the fact that its 74% owner, Deutsche Telekom, is looking to offload USD11.2bn of bonds from its US subsidiary into the market. DT has filed a shelf to sell the USD11.2bn of T-Mobile USA debt it inherited from providing an inter-company loan. Another headwind is the rumour that DT, having failed to sell T-Mobile USA to AT&T;, might consider DISH Network as a suitor. That sort of hair on a credit would normally destroy its chances of selling anything in the bond market, and especially one in such an intensely competitive, low-margin sector as wireless telecoms. Yet the deal not only attracted huge demand, but was priced inside comparables and proceeded to jump a whole point in price on the break, thanks to the stunning turnaround of the company this year under the leadership of its feisty new CEO. “CEOs are normally very reserved, but Legere is out there bragging about T-Mobile USA’s performance and bashing his competitors - and it’s working,” said one credit strategist. “He’s really backing it up with a very impressive turnaround.” Since taking the job last September, Legere has based his strategy on pushing the buttons of AT&T; and Verizon’s aggravated customer base. “By fixing the things that drive them mad, like contracts and upgrades, and freeing them from the two-year sentences imposed on them by our competitors, they are choosing the new T-Mobile in unprecedented numbers,” said Legere in a press release. His bluster was backed up by news that T-Mobile gained 1.1m new customers in the second quarter - including 685,000 contract subscribers - its largest customer growth in four years and compared with a loss of 557,000 a year ago. This year, the company has also merged with MetroPCS, signed up to offer iPhones and begun an upgrade of its network quality and geographic reach. The bond issue benefited from the earnings momentum, being priced at par to yield 5.25%, down from guidance of 5.375% and initial price thoughts in the mid-5.00% range. Pricing was inside its outstanding 6.25% 2021 eight-year bonds, trading at USD100.875 to yield 6.06%. Once a name that traded wide to Sprint, T-Mobile now trades tighter, with Sprint’s unguaranteed 6.9% 2019s quoted at USD104.25 to yield 6.00%. “The deal went very well, and probably did better than anyone expected,” said one syndicate manager. “It’s late into August, we have rising rates and we’ve seen lacklustre performance by other deals that were done earlier in the week.” Investors were willing to take a bet that DT is not planning to shoot itself in the foot by dumping its USD11.2bn of bonds into the market, and expect it will instead eke them out over time. And some argue that the event risk is already factored into its trading levels. “With TMUS trading about 47bp wide of general BB credits, the market is already pricing in a significant probability of either a DISH transaction or a tough technical should DT sell its TMUS bonds to the public,” wrote Barclays. Some investors also see better value in bonds issued by Sprint and T-Mobile, which offer about five to six times the amount of spread on an AT&T; or Verizon bond. “The question is, are you taking on five to six times more risk in doing so? I don’t think so,” said Scott Kimball, senior portfolio manager at Taplin Canida & Habacht, part of the BMO Global Asset Management Group. The new notes were quoted at 99.5-99.8 on Friday, pulled down by the weak tone in secondary credit markets following a spike in interest rates.",8162013,http://www.reuters.com/article/t-mobile-bond/update-1-t-mobile-usa-connects-with-buyers-idUSL6N0GH2M820130816

466,VZ,"CBS signs Verizon deal, no Time Warner Cable progress","(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc reached an agreement to carry CBS Corp television programming while cable rival Time Warner Cable Inc’s blackout of CBS stretched into nearly its third week in New York, Los Angeles and Dallas. CBS’ chief executive Leslie Moonves told employees in a memo on Thursday that the same terms of Verizon’s deal were also offered to Time Warner Cable. “You should know that Time Warner Cable has been offered almost exactly the same deal for CBS carriage to which Verizon has agreed,” Moonves said in the memo seen by Reuters. However, leading cable companies such as Time Warner Cable and Comcast usually receive more favorable terms than newer TV services such as Verizon because they have been around longer and have more subscribers. Verizon on Thursday said it agreed to continued retransmission of CBS stations and wider distribution of CBS Sports network on its FiOS TV service in multiple markets around the country. Their previous agreement was not due to expire until the end of year, Verizon spokesman Bill Kula said. Both companies did not disclose how much the deal is worth but typically analysts estimate a deal with a TV provider with 5 million subscribers can be worth upwards of $100 million. Moonves expressed frustration in the memo over the fruitless negotiations with Time Warner Cable, although he did say that both sides will “keep talking.” “I cannot describe to you the frustration I feel at the way these negotiations have gone. Never in my most pessimistic moments did I ever think that they would have lasted this long and have been so difficult,” Moonves said. Moonves added that the Time Warner Cable is “demanding different terms than any other company in the business” and said he was “mystified by what appears to be a lack of urgency” on Time Warner Cable’s part to resolve the matter. Time Warner Cable declined to comment on Moonves’ remarks. Verizon, which competes fiercely with Time Warner Cable in New York, has said that it has signed on customers frustrated by the CBS blackout, which started August 2 after the companies failed to agree on distribution terms. Time Warner Cable Inc will lift a blackout of the local CBS station in New York briefly on Thursday so subscribers can watch a candidate debate in the New York City Comptroller race. If the blackout continues, the company will also broadcast the Republican mayoral candidates debate on August 28 and the Democratic mayoral debate on September 23. But subscribers will still be unable to watch any regular CBS shows. Most analysts expect the two parties to reach a deal by the time the National Football League season kicks off in September.

468,VZ,Verizon in talks to buy out Vodafone stake: sources,"LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications is close to buying the remaining stake in Verizon Wireless from Vodafone Group PLC it does not own for potentially $130 billion, according to people familiar with the talks, in what could be the third-biggest deal of all time. Verizon, the number one U.S. mobile carrier, has made no secret of its desire to gain full ownership of a network that is growing fast and generating billions of dollars in free cash flow, hoping to reap the monetary benefits. Now, rising interest rates, rapidly intensifying competition and Verizon’s share price, which is off 12 percent in recent weeks, have lent urgency to get a deal done before raising money becomes too expensive. Across the ocean, Vodafone’s Chief Executive Vittorio Colao has bided his time, making it clear he would only sell the 45 percent stake at what he considered the right time and most importantly the right price. The deal would leave the world’s second largest mobile operator with assets in Europe and emerging markets such as India, Turkey and Africa and money to give back to shareholders. The deal has been years in the making. Vodafone came close selling out in 2004, when it bid for AT&T; Wireless and would have had to shed its Verizon stake. The British company, however, lost that bid to Cingular, and has since held on to the Verizon Wireless stake for its exposure to the U.S. wireless market. The Verizon Wireless joint venture started in 2000. A few weeks ago, Verizon and Vodafone resumed talks discussing a sale for around $130 billion, according to a person familiar with the situation, who asked not to be named. Two sources said an announcement could come as soon as next week. A third person familiar with the matter cautioned that while the companies had made progress, some issues around taxes, price and structure still need to be ironed out. The person cautioned that the deal could still fall apart. If conditions remain as they are, financing would not be a problem, the source added, saying it would include syndicated loans and tiers of lenders. Reuters reported in April that Verizon had hired advisers for a possible $100 billion bid, an opening gambit that analysts and investors said was too low, putting the value of Vodafone’s holding nearer $120 billion. With the price tag rising from there, the only M&A; deals bigger than this would be Vodafone’s $203 billion takeover of Germany’s Mannesmann in 1999 and AOL’s $181 billion acquisition of Time Warner the following year. A statement from Vodafone on Thursday confirming talks sent its shares up 9 percent to a 12-year high of 207 pence as investors and analysts said a deal could finally be on the cards. It shares closed at 205.78 pence. Shares in Verizon ended the day with a 2.7 percent gain in New York to $47.82. Assuming a $130 billion price tag, total advisory fees for banks involved would be in the $200 million to $250 million range, according to Freeman estimates. Arrangement fees for a loan syndication could be around 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent of the proceeds raised or in a range of $125 million to 250 million range for a $60 billion syndication, the research firm estimated. As U.S. growth slows, because most people already own smartphones, and competition intensifies, Verizon is under pressure to find ways to expand. Despite the steep sums being discussed, Verizon investors expect handsome rewards from full Verizon Wireless ownership. Even assuming a $130 billion price tag, with roughly half funded by debt, such a deal would increase Verizon’s pro forma earnings per share by 13 percent in 2014, Nomura analyst Adam Ilkowitz said in a research note. “As Verizon would own 100 percent of arguably the best wireless asset in the country, in addition to a modestly improving wireline business, we believe the market should support this deal even at this lofty multiple,” Ilkowitz said. With 2012 free cash flow of $28.6 billion at Verizon Wireless, RBC Capital Markets analyst Doug Colandrea said Verizon has the ability to rapidly repay the debt raised to fund the deal. The two companies also own a cross holding in Vodafone Italy, which could form part of the deal, with Verizon possibly selling its 23 percent back to Vodafone, which has 77 percent, sources told Bloomberg. Charles Stanley analyst Tom Gidley-Kitchin said it was inevitable Verizon would make a serious approach. “Vodafone doesn’t have to sell, they are quite prepared to wait,” he said. “I don’t think Vittorio Colao is going to be bamboozled into selling at a sub-optimal price, so I think Verizon will understand they will have to pay closer to $130 billion.” Vodafone has changed its strategy from being a pure mobile operator to offering combined services such as television and fixed line broadband. To that end it has agreed to buy Kabel Deutschland for 7.7 billion euros. The stake in Verizon Wireless has become increasingly valuable to Vodafone as its fortunes have waned in its core European markets. But it has a strategy of wanting full control of its assets, and as the junior partner in Verizon Wireless, it has no control over the timing and level of dividends from the group. Vodafone’s Colao said in May he would not bow to pressure to do any deal. Verizon has been able to use the dividend as a lever to persuade Vodafone to sell. The company paid no dividends from the asset between 2005 and 2011, which at the time was viewed by analysts as trying to pressure Vodafone into doing a deal. Verizon Wireless paid out a $7 billion dividend to its parent companies in June, indicating that they were on better terms than at earlier stages in the relationship. A Verizon representative declined to comment. Vodafone investors and analysts expect the company, which has $30.6 billion of debt according to Thomson Reuters data, to return a lot of the proceeds of a deal to shareholders, rather than embark on more M&A; or paying down borrowing. “We would expect them to distribute a very large proportion of the proceeds to shareholders,” analyst Gidley-Kitchin said. A disposal would change the investment case for Vodafone, as the group would be left with a mixture of low growth, but cash generation in Europe and higher growth, but less cash generating emerging markets, he said. Analysts and investors have said that structuring the deal to ensure not too much tax was payable by the seller was a tricky issue. “The tax leakage being rumored is $10 billion, which I think would be a good result for Vodafone holders,” one of the 10 largest investors in the UK-listed telecoms company told Reuters. Vodafone’s credit default swaps, which measure the cost of insuring against a default on its debts, fell 6 basis points to 70 basis points after the news.

470,VZ,"US STOCKS-Wall St rises on economy, but Syria concerns limit gains","* GDP, labor data points to improved economic strength * Vodafone in talks with Verizon to sell share of joint venture * Housing stocks rally, rebounding after recent decline * Indexes up: Dow 0.1 pct, S&P; 0.2 pct, Nasdaq 0.8 pct By Ryan Vlastelica NEW YORK, Aug 29 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed modestly higher on Thursday as the economy showed signs of improvement, but uncertainty over possible military action against Syria continued to pressure markets. Talks that could lead to a major deal in which U.S. phone company Verizon buys the part of Verizon Wireless it doesn’t already own from Vodafone helped push stocks higher. Wall Street was solidly higher most of the session but pared gains in the last hour on concerns over Syria. Many in the market expect a strike by the United States and its allies  because of an alleged poison gas attack by government forces  that killed Syrian civilians. U.S. officials said a response would be “discrete and limited.” “That there will be an attack is priced into markets, but there’s no way the market appreciates the implications beyond that if the U.S. were to go to war,” said Joe Tanious, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds in New York. “It will create a lot of side effects the market isn’t aware of, with the impact on oil the main complication.” U.S. crude futures have spiked 2.2 percent this week on tensions oil supply from the Middle East will be interrupted. Stocks rose after the government said in an upwardly revised estimate the economy expanded by a stronger-than-expected 2.5 percent in the second quarter.

The market’s gains were broad, with eight of the S&P; 500’s 10 sectors in positive territory. Housing stocks were among the strongest of the day. The U.S. economy expanded more quickly than expected in the second quarter, with the preliminary read on gross domestic product topping expectations. Separately, weekly jobless claims fell more than anticipated in the latest week, a possible sign that hiring improved in August. The robust data could bolster the case for the Federal Reserve to soon wind down a major economic stimulus program that has driven a rally of more than 15 percent in the S&P; 500 this year. Many market participants expect an announcement about scaling back the Fed’s asset purchases after its next policy meeting in mid-September. The data “reiterates that the economy continues to grow, which is supportive to risk assets and bodes well for the prospect of future growth,” said Joe Tanious, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds in New York. “That the market is reacting positively to this shows that investors have become more comfortable with the idea of tapering.” Recent market direction has been driven by geopolitical uncertainties related to Syria and a potential retaliation against the country’s government allegedly using chemical weapons on civilians. Over the past two sessions, the S&P; has gained about 0.9 percent but remains down 1.1 percent for the week. A military strike could be delayed, not only by the continued presence of U.N. weapons inspectors in Syria, but by the Obama administration’s efforts to coordinate with international partners and growing demands for consultation with U.S. lawmakers. Despite that, analysts said the issue was the primary headwind facing markets. “That there will be an attack is priced into markets, but there’s no way the market appreciates the implications beyond that if the U.S. were to go to war,” said Tanious, who helps oversee $1.5 trillion in assets. “It will create a lot of side effects the market isn’t aware of, with the impact on oil the main complication.” Crude oil has spiked 3.3 percent this week on concerns that tensions in the Middle East will impact oil supplies. Brent crude is up 5 percent on the week, though both dipped modestly on Thursday. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 43.09 points, or 0.29 percent, at 14,867.60. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  was up 6.72 points, or 0.41 percent, at 1,641.68. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 32.52 points, or 0.90 percent, at 3,625.86. The S&P; broke above its 100-day moving average of 1,638.98, a level that is viewed as an indication of near-term momentum. The benchmark index has closed below it for the past two sessions. Homebuilding stocks were among the strongest of the day, rebounding after a period of recent weakness. Lennar Corp  rose 3.3 percent to $32.66 while PulteGroup Inc  was up 3.3 percent to $15.88 and D.R. Horton Inc gained 2.9 percent at $18.29. The PHLX Housing Sector Index  climbed 1.7 percent but remains down 0.7 percent on the week. U.S.-listed shares of Vodafone Group jumped 7.5 percent to $31.61 as the biggest percentage gainer on the Nasdaq 100 index, after the company said it was in talks with Verizon Communications to sell its 45 percent stake in their U.S. joint venture, Verizon Wireless. Verizon rose 2.8 percent to $47.85 as one of the top boosts to the Dow.

472,VZ,UPDATE 1-Canada's Harper says wireless rules do not favor foreign players,"* Rogers, BCE, Telus say auction rules favor a Verizon * Auction of wireless spectrum set for January * Verizon’s interest in Canada may be cooling OTTAWA, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper on Thursday disputed claims by his country’s leading wireless companies that his government’s telecommunications rules give unfair advantages to foreign players like Verizon Communications Inc. Canada’s three biggest wireless companies - Rogers Communications, BCE Inc and Telus Corp  - are asking the Conservative government to rethink its rules for next January’s auction of wireless spectrum, saying the playing field is slanted in favor of a Verizon. Verizon had signaled a tentative interest in entering the Canadian market, but there is speculation more recently that its interest is waning, reinforced on Thursday when Vodafone Group Plc said it was in talks with Verizon to sell its stake in Verizon Wireless, the No. 1 U.S. mobile carrier. . “The reality of the situation here is there is no special rule or special loopholes for foreign companies,” Harper told reporters in Toronto. “There are rules that assist all new entrants, whether they be Canadian or foreign, to enter the marketplace and provide competition that will be in the interest of Canadian consumers,” he said. Under rules the government says are designed to increase competition and drive down prices for consumers, new entrants can bid in the auction for two of four prime blocks of the spectrum that wireless companies need to operate mobile services, while the existing big players can bid for only one block apiece. The three incumbents, which cater to 90 percent of the market, have launched an advertising blitz to sway public opinion. While they favor competition, they say, the new rules were drafted with smaller firms in mind, and Verizon is bigger than the three of them combined. If Ottawa lends a hand to Verizon to enter Canada, they say, the Canadian players could be forced to cut jobs and trim mobile phone coverage in rural areas. One full-page newspaper ad this week compared the country’s airwaves to precious natural resources: “If the government let a giant foreign corporation buy up half of Canada’s water, you would be outraged,” it said, with a photograph of a lake and mountains. It went on to say foreign corporations were getting “special treatment.” Harper and the minister overseeing telecoms policy, Industry Minister James Moore, have made it clear they won’t budge as a Sept. 17 deadline looms for companies to register for the auction. “As I’ve said before, I understand full well the desire of the major incumbent telecommunication companies to protect their bottom line. They have every right to do that,” Harper said. “But the responsibility of the government is to act in the broader public interest.” Verizon had approached two small Canadian wireless companies earlier this year, but it has now decided to delay any such move, raising doubts about whether Verizon still had plans to expand into Canada, the Globe and Mail newspaper reported this month.",8292013,http://www.reuters.com/article/canada-telecoms-harper/update-1-canadas-harper-says-wireless-rules-do-not-favor-foreign-players-idUSL2N0GU1AL20130829
473,VZ,Timeline: Verizon and Vodafone's long relationship,"(Reuters) - Vodafone Group PLC confirmed on Thursday it was in talks with Verizon Communications Inc to sell its stake in Verizon Wireless, the number one U.S. mobile carrier, in what could be the third-biggest deal of all time. It is the latest twist in a long relationship between the two telecommunications giants. Following is a timeline charting their history together: June: U.S. regional phone company Bell Atlantic forms a wireless partnership with neighboring peer NYNEX covering 55 million potential customers. Verizon today calls this deal the beginnings of what is now Verizon Wireless. April: Bell Atlantic and NYNEX agree to an outright merger. July: Bell Atlantic and peer GTE agree to merge. January: Britain’s Vodafone says it will buy U.S. wireless company AirTouch Communications with interests in German and Italian telecoms businesses controlled by Mannesmann AG for $66.5 billion in a record transatlantic takeover. September: Bell Atlantic and Vodafone AirTouch Plc agree to combine their U.S. wireless companies, including Bell Atlantic Mobile and AirTouch Cellular, into a single joint venture. February: Mannesmann agrees to a $203 billion all-share Vodafone bid, which gives its investors 49.5 percent of the combined company, in what is the largest M&A; deal ever. April: The Bell Atlantic/Vodafone AirTouch joint venture is approved and begins operations as Verizon Wireless. June: The Bell Atlantic/GTE merger closes, creating Verizon Communications. At that time, GTE’s wireless operations are added into Verizon Wireless. At that point Verizon Communications became majority owner of the wireless joint venture, with a 55 percent stake. February: Vodafone loses out in the bidding to buy AT&T; Wireless, a deal that would have let the company bring its brand to the United States but also might have forced it to sell its Verizon Wireless stake. Vodafone CEO Arun Sarin says Vodafone will sit down with Verizon and discuss the future of their partnership. September: Sarin says both Vodafone and Verizon would like to have bigger stakes in their joint venture, creating an impasse between the two. In 2004 the joint venture pays its parents dividends of $3.2 billion in two installments. Verizon Wireless pays dividends of about $1.997 billion to its parents and distributions to cover its parents’ tax payments. While it pays its parents billions of dollars in the coming years to cover tax obligations, its next non-tax related payout is not announced until 2011, causing friction between them. July: Vodafone denies reports it is considering a $160 billion to take over Verizon Communications in its entirety as a way to consolidate their venture. July: Vittorio Colao is appointed Chief Executive of Vodafone, replacing Sarin. Colao had been on the board since October 2006. January: Verizon Wireless completes a $28.1 billion acquisition of regional carrier Alltel that includes the assumption of $22.2 billion in debt. For years it said it was withholding dividends to its parents in order to use its cash to pay off the debt incurred in the Alltel deal. July: Lowell McAdam is named CEO of Verizon Communications replacing Ivan Seidenberg. Before McAdam became COO of Verizon in 2010 he had served as CEO of Verizon Wireless. January: Verizon Wireless pays its parents a dividend of $10 billion. It had announced plans to pay a dividend in July 2011. December: Verizon Wireless pays an $8.5 billion dividend. January: The year kicks off with reports Verizon could consider a purchase of the Verizon Wireless stake. CEO McAdam tells Dow Jones a deal could be “feasible” but then tells Reuters the companies were not in talks about a deal at the time. March: Speculation is rampant again after a Bloomberg report that Verizon is eying a resolution to the Vodafone relationship this year. Sources tell Reuters that Vodafone has lawyers and bankers looking at deal options. April 3: Verizon repeats its long stated desire to buy out Vodafone’s 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless and says has no intention of pursuing a Verizon/Vodafone merger in response to speculation. April 18: Verizon CFO Fran Shammo says his company is confident it could buy Vodafone’s Verizon Wireless stake without major tax implications. This is seen by investors as a sign that Verizon is applying pressure on Vodafone to discuss a deal. April 24: Reuters reports that Verizon is preparing a $100 billion bid for the stake and could use a structure that could limit Vodafone’s tax obligation to $5 billion or less. May 21: Vodafone boss Vittorio Colao says he will not bow to pressure to do any deal, staking his reputation on selling the group’s stake in Verizon Wireless at the right time and right price. July 23: Vodafone Chairman Gerard Kleisterlee says the company’s board will seriously consider any offer for its 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless if it offers more value to investors than the current status quo. Aug 28: Verizon and Vodafone restart talks over a possible buyout of the British firm’s stake in Verizon Wireless, the Wall Street Journal reports.

474,VZ,GLOBAL MARKETS-Shares up as Syria reassessed; Dollar up on U.S. GDP,"* Anxiety over imminent Syrian attack eases, caution rules * Global equities up; Wall St gains, Nasdaq up 1 pct * Dollar gains after U.S. GDP, jobless reinforce Fed tapering view * Oil retreats from 6-month peak, gold off 3-1/2 month high By Angela Moon NEW YORK, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Strong growth in the U.S. economy and signs of a delay in expected Western military strikes on Syria lifted equities worldwide on Thursday and pushed the dollar to two-week peaks. Wall Street rose for a second day, boosted by a possible large deal between Vodafone and Verizon as investors took comfort that a potential Western military strike on Syria appeared to be slowed, for now. Data showed the American economy grew more quickly than expected in the second quarter, and weekly claims for unemployment benefits fell, bolstering the case for the Federal Reserve to begin winding down its massive economic stimulus program. In the currency market, the dollar rose to two-week highs and was on track for its largest daily gain against the euro in more than four months. Most major risk asset markets had already been recovering ahead of the U.S economic data on signs that divisions among lawmakers in Britain and the United States would delay any imminent action on Syria in retaliation for alleged gas attacks last week. “There is no doubt the last couple of days the markets have bounced and continued to recover from Tuesday’s selloff. A lot of that you can point to the better-than-expected second-quarter GDP numbers this morning,” said David Lyon, investment specialist at JP Morgan Private Bank in San Francisco. President Barack Obama has told Americans a military strike against Syria is in their interests, and administration officials are expected to brief congressional leaders on Thursday about plans to respond. In the oil markets, the reduced likelihood of an immediate major supply disruption caused Brent crude to drop, ending its strongest two-day gain since January 2012. Brent for October delivery hit a low of $114.94 a barrel, down $1.67, before recovering to trade around $116.00. It jumped over 5 percent in the previous two sessions, posting its strongest two-day gain since January 2012. October U.S. crude fell $1.50 to a low of $108.60 a barrel before rallying to around $109.30, following a near 4 percent gain over the past two days. “The market is reassessing the supply implications of the conflict in Syria,” said Eugen Weinberg, global head of commodities at Germany’s Commerzbank. “Our view is military action will not destabilize the whole Middle East, which means the risk premium is being overstated. If the conflict is contained in Syria, prices are too high.” Traditional safe-haven gold eased 0.5 percent to around $1,413 an ounce after reaching a 3-1/2 month high in Wednesday’s flight to safety. In emerging markets, Brazil’s decision to raise its benchmark interest rate to a 16-month high of 9 percent on Wednesday helped stabilize the real, while in Indonesia the rupiah strengthened slightly after its central bank hiked its key lending rates. The Indian rupee rose as high as 66.85 per dollar, up sharply from a record low of 68.85 per dollar hit on Wednesday when its central bank moved to provide dollars directly to oil companies to give the currency some relief. Emerging market currencies in countries with high current account deficits such as India, Turkey and Brazil have plunged between 12 and 18 percent against the dollar this year on expectations of a withdrawal of the U.S. monetary stimulus that has boosted riskier assets. The better tone in world equity markets emerged after energy shares on Wall Street gained on the rise in oil prices, and this spread to Asia, where MSCI’s Asia-Pacific index, excluding Japan , rose 1.2 percent. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 59.26 points, or 0.40 percent, at 14,883.77. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up 7.74 points, or 0.47 percent, at 1,642.70. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 33.44 points, or 0.93 percent, at 3,626.79. In Treasuries, the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was down 2/32, the yield at 2.7727 percent. European stocks also rose, snapping a sharp two-day drop, as Vodafone’s renewed talks on selling Verizon its stake in their cellular joint venture sent the UK firm’s stock to a 12-year high and sparked a brisk rally in the telecom sector. The FTSEurofirst 300 was up 0.7 percent at 1,207.05, led by a 3.5 percent rise in telecoms stocks. The index had dropped about 2 percent in the last two days. However, an auction of new Italian debt showed investors remained concerned about the shaky coalition, with government borrowing costs over five years rising. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 countries, was up 0.4 percent.

Data showed the U.S. economy grew more quickly than expected in the second quarter thanks to a surge in exports. The report, alongside data suggesting a strengthening in job numbers in August, could bolster the case for the Federal Reserve to soon wind down a major economic stimulus program that has been a pillar of the rally in equities this year. The numbers show the economic recovery may have started in the first half of the year and the economy is strong enough to allow for the Fed to scale back its stimulus, said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York. U.S.-traded shares of Vodafone Group jumped 8.4 percent to $31.89 after the company said it was in talks with Verizon Communications to sell its 45 percent stake in their U.S. joint venture, Verizon Wireless. Verizon shares rose 3.4 percent to $48.15. Merger and acquisition activity “tells us companies have a lot of firepower, the ability to use cash, a lot of debt they could utilize and currency for stock deals, all that is positive” for the market, Orlando said. Retaliation over the Syrian government’s alleged chemical weapons attack on civilians could be delayed, not only by the U.N. weapons inspectors’ continued presence in Syria, but by the Obama administration’s efforts to coordinate with international partners and growing demands for consultation with U.S. lawmakers. “There’s a lot of uncertainty as Western powers have taken a step back, so the market is encouraged of some stepping back from the brink,” said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois.

Energy shares knocked some 13 points off the FTSE 100, as the vote reduced chances of an imminent Western strike that would hurt supply and raise oil prices, while other shares remained under pressure from the persisting uncertainties. “People are squaring up long positions over the weekend as the Syria situation could easily escalate. That is dominating above any other news right now,” said Lex van Dam, hedge fund manager at Hampstead Capital, which manages around $500 million in assets. The FTSE 100 closed down 70.12 points, or 1.1 percent, at 6,412.93 points, retreating after Thursday’s 0.8 percent rise. It posted a 3.1 percent drop in August, a month in which investors have been anxious over prospects for diminishing U.S. stimulus as well as the Syrian conflict. GFT Markets technical analyst Fawad Razaqzada was cautious on the UK benchmark, which came under pressure on Friday after testing key resistance at 6,500. “The trend ... remains bearish unless this level is taken out on a daily closing basis,” he said.

480,VZ,FTSE 100 runs out of energy as oil price falls on Syria,"* FTSE 100 down 6.20 points at 6,476.85 * Energy share drag as oil falls on Syria * Telecoms remain upbeat after Vodafone, Verizon talks * ARM rallies as Deutsche double upgrades to “buy” By David Brett LONDON, Aug 30 (Reuters) - British stocks opened little changed on Friday although heavyweight energy shares were under pressure as the price of oil fell after the government’s defeat in parliament over particpating in any U.S.-led military action against Syria. Energy shares, which had spiked in tandem with oil prices when the prospect of attacking Syria appeared imminent earlier in the week, took around 7 points off the FTSE 100 as the cost of oil tracked back. Britain’s top shares fell 6.20 points to 6,476.85, by 0728 GMT, having added 0.8 percent in the previous session, although the index kept well clear of levels that might otherwise test investors resolve. “News that UK will not attack Syria may give some relief this morning and so long as FTSE stays up above 6,390-6,400 levels upside seems to be on the cards thanks largely to Vodafone yesterday,” Jawaid Afsar, sales trader at SecurEquity, said. “Overall though any weakness below 6,400 level and we could test the 200 day level (around 6,320),” he said. Strong gains on Thursday helped the index erase some of the losses sustained during the month by the broader index, which remains weighed upon by concerns over the impact of a potential wind down of stimulus in the United States with London’s blue chips set to close August down around 2 percent. Most sectors were flat on Friday reflecting what is expected to be a subdued trading session ahead of the month-end and a long holiday weekend in the United States, although telecoms added 2 points to the index and remained buoyant after Vodafone confirmed on Thursday it was in talks to sell its stake in its U.S. joint venture with Verizon. Chip designer ARM Holdings was the top individual gainer, rising 1.8 percent after Deutsche Bank double upgraded the company to “buy” from “sell” after a pull-back in ARM’s share price of around 20 percent since its May peak. “Our analysis suggests a limited impact on ARM’s earning per share growth even if (U.S. rival) Intel gains 10 percent unit share by 2016 and we deem a high-end slowdown as largely in the price,” Deutsche Bank says in a note. But financials including banks — the major laggards in August — were down.

486,VZ,"Verizon, Vodafone to announce $130 billion U.S. deal on Monday","NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Verizon Communications and Vodafone plan to announce a $130 billion deal on Monday that will give the U.S. telecom giant complete control of Verizon Wireless, subject to final board approval, people familiar with the matter said. Vodafone said in a statement late on Sunday it was in advanced talks with Verizon to sell its 45 percent stake in the joint venture for $130 billion, comprising cash and common shares, but that there was no certainty an agreement would be reached. “A further announcement will be made as soon as practicable,” it said of the deal to exit the largest mobile operator in the U.S.. Under the terms of the proposed agreement, Vodafone would get $60 billion in cash, $60 billion in Verizon stock, and an additional $10 billion from smaller transactions that will take the total deal value to $130 billion, two of the people familiar with the matter said on Saturday. To fund the cash portion of the deal, Verizon has lined up as much as $65 billion in financing from four banks: JPMorgan Chase & Co, Morgan Stanley, Barclays Plc and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, they said. The banks have committed to the financing which is expected be split evenly among the four, two people said. A full announcement of the terms is expected to come after the stock market closes in London on Monday, after the board of Verizon meets earlier in the day to vote on the proposed transaction, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Vodafone’s board was scheduled to meet on Sunday to approve the deal, the people said. Both groups declined to comment. If the deal is concluded, it will end one of the longest-running corporate standoffs, which has at times seen both partners seek to buy out the other in times of weakness. For Verizon, it means that it no longer has to share the billions in cash generated by Verizon Wireless. On the Vodafone side, Chief Executive Vittorio Colao will get a war chest of cash to reward shareholders and potentially carry out acquisitions to strengthen the group’s European and emerging market operations. All the people asked not to be identified because the matter is not public. An agreement over Verizon Wireless would mark the culmination of on-again, off-again discussions going as far back as 2004, when Vodafone bid for AT&T; Inc’s wireless business in a move that would have required it to shed its Verizon Wireless stake. The British company lost that bid and has since held on to the Verizon Wireless stake for its exposure to the highly profitable U.S. wireless market, saying it would only sell if Verizon offered a price that was more valuable to its shareholders than the status quo. At $130 billion, it would be the third-largest corporate deal of all time. A top 10 Vodafone investor told Reuters last week that $130 billion would be “a good price” that shareholders would welcome. “Colao’s done a good job over the last five years. He’s done well not to have sold the U.S. sooner. There were people calling for him to sell the U.S. business three or four years ago and clearly it’s been the right thing to do not to do that because it’s grown in value hugely over that time. “Taking the big picture, I think the management has done a good job and if they get the mooted price for Verizon they’ll be treated as heroes.” Talks picked up in earnest a few weeks ago, as Verizon grew concerned that its window of opportunity was closing, with interest rates due to rise and its own stock price declining. That prompted Verizon to raise the offer price from the $100 billion it had initially floated to around $130 billion, sources have said. Even after the bump in price, the deal is expected to be accretive to Verizon’s earnings, one of the sources said. Another hindrance to a deal has been the possibility of a huge tax bill for Vodafone from the sale, based on Verizon Wireless’ massive growth since it was established. But the sources said the deal would be structured in such way that Vodafone’s tax bill could be cut to around $5 billion. A deal would add to the spate of telecom acquisitions this year in Europe and the U.S.. Most recently, Japan’s SoftBank Corp took control of Sprint Nextel Corp, the No. 3 U.S. wireless provider, in a $21.6 billion deal that could make the U.S. market more competitive. Although overall M&A; activity remains lower than last year at this time, the telecom sector has been a bright spot of deal-making.

489,VZ,PRESS DIGEST-Sunday British Business-Sept 1,"LONDON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - British newspapers reported the following business stories on Sunday: The Sunday Times: Vodafone Group is expected to pay only $5 billion in tax on the $130 billion sale of its stake in American mobile network Verizon this week. Vodafone shareholders have told the Sunday Times they expect to receive about 70 percent of the sale proceeds. The newspaper, citing insiders, added that Verizon would help raise funds by launching a $20 billion bond issue and borrowing $40 billion from a club of five or six investment banks. An influential group of economists on Sunday attacked Bank of England governor Mark Carney’s forward guidance policy, warning it was based on a “flawed model” and risked “accelerating inflation or worsening boom-bust cycles”. The criticism by members of the shadow monetary policy committee comes after Carney reiterated his pledge last week not to consider a hike in interest rates until the unemployment rate drops from its current rate of 7.8 percent to 7 percent. That was unlikely for another three years, he said. Many members of the shadow MPC believe the Bank should begin nudging up rates now and that the forward guidance would delay necessary rate rises. EX-RIO CHIEF IN VEDANTA TALKS Ex-Rio Tinto  chief executive Tom Albanese is in talks about a senior board role at Vedanta Resources , including potentially taking over as CEO of the Indian natural resources firm, the Sunday Times said without citing sources. Twitter has begun laying the ground for a stock market float next year in which the tech firm could be valued at up to $15 billion, the Sunday Times said, citing senior bankers. The float could come as early as the first quarter of 2014, sources told the newspaper, adding that the firm is expected to select several investment banks to handle the listing in the coming weeks. Dubai could become the biggest shareholder in British aircraft services firm BBA Aviation as part of a possible 2 billion pound ($3 billion) tie-up between the company and American firm StandardAero. Dubai Aerospace Enterprise (DAE), which owns U.S.-based engine repair and maintenance business StandardAero, could take a stake of up to 25 percent in the enlarged business, the British newspaper said. British pub chain JD Wetherspoon is preparing to open its first pub in Ireland in the Dublin suburb of Blackrock, the Sunday Times said, citing the firm. A record 797 tons of gold worth an estimated $37 billion was sold out of British vaults to foreign buyers, mostly in China and India, in the first six months of the year, according to research from investment bank Macquarie. IMPERIAL BUYS CHINESE INVENTOR OF E-CIGARETTE Imperial Tobacco is paying $75 million for the e-cigarette division of Chinese firm Dragonite, the Sunday Times said, citing the firm. The British newspaper said Imperial had confirmed the acquisition but highlighted that the deal had yet to be approved by Dragonite’s shareholders. Bosses at Burton’s, the maker of Wagon Wheels and Jammie Dodgers biscuits, are lining up a buyout of the firm after its owners put it up for sale, the Sunday Times said without citing sources. Private equity firms have been eager to back their bid, the newspaper said. Burton’s, owned by U.S. private equity and hedge fund firm Apollo Global Management, and Canadian bank, CIBC, is expected to go for between 300-350 million pounds($541 million). Housebuilder Berkeley Group has bought the former head office of the QVC shopping channel in Battersea, southwest London, for 105 million pounds ($162.43 million), the Sunday Times said without citing sources. The Sunday Telegraph: CO-OP BANK INVESTORS EXPRESS ANGER OVER RESCUE DEAL Senior fund managers have warned the Co-op that it risks full-scale investor rebellion unless it begins engaging with its bondholders ahead of the launch of a controversial 1.5 billion pound ($2.32 billion) emergency recapitalisation of its banking arm. The Co-op has insisted that investors will have to wait until the end of October to see the details of the so-called “exchange offer”, which would see bondholders take haircuts on the value of their investments in order to raise cash for the bank. Major carriers Emirates, Etihad and British Airways are drawing up emergency plans including re-routing planes ahead of a potential military attack on Syria.

A deal, which the sources said could be announced as soon as Monday, would cap Verizon’s decade-long effort to win full control of the No. 1 U.S. wireless provider. At $130 billion, it would be the third-largest corporate acquisition of all time and mark British telecom giant Vodafone’s exit from the large but mature U.S. market. Vodafone owns 45 percent of the Verizon Wireless joint venture that was formed in 2000. Verizon Communications and Vodafone declined to comment. Verizon plans to pay for half of the purchase with its own stock, the sources said. For the rest, it has tapped JPMorgan Chase & Co, Morgan Stanley, Barclays Plc  and Bank of America Merrill Lynch to help raise the funds through a mix of bonds and bank loans, the sources said. The banks are joint lead arrangers of the financing, with JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley serving as global coordinators, the sources said. The four banks are also advising Verizon, along with former Morgan Stanley banker Paul Taubman and Guggenheim Partners, the sources said. Taubman, the former co-president of Morgan Stanley’s institutional securities business and a top dealmaker, left the Wall Street firm earlier this year after 27 years there. Goldman Sachs Group Inc and UBS AG are advising Vodafone, the sources said. Goldman Sachs declined to comment, while the other banks were not immediately available for comment. Since Verizon, led by Chief Executive Lowell McAdam, already had operational control of the wireless company, the deal is not expected to create any changes for its customers, but its additional financial firepower could help the company boost its service going forward. After the deal, Vodafone, the world’s second largest mobile operator, will have assets in Europe and emerging markets such as India, Turkey and Africa. But it raises questions about what the company will do with the windfall. Top investors in Vodafone contacted by Reuters earlier this week were split between those wanting to see the cash returned as dividends and those wanting the firm to invest it. [ID: nL6N0GV18W] A deal would come amid a spate of consolidation attempts, both successful and failed, in the telecom industry over the past few years. Most recently, Japan’s SoftBank Corp  took control of Sprint Nextel Corp, the No. 3 U.S. wireless provider, in a $21.6 billion deal. In a related plan, Sprint agreed to buy out the portion of wireless company Clearwire Corp that it already did not own. An agreement over Verizon Wireless would mark the culmination of on-again, off-again discussions going as far back as 2004, when Vodafone bid for AT&T; Inc’s wireless business and would have had to shed its Verizon Wireless stake. The British company, however, lost that bid to Cingular, and has since held on to the Verizon Wireless stake for its exposure to the U.S. wireless market. The news of Verizon’s latest efforts was first reported by Reuters in April. At the time, sources said Verizon had hired advisers to prepare a $100 billion cash and stock bid to take full control of Verizon Wireless. Verizon was ready to push aggressively but preferred a friendly deal. But Vodafone Chief Executive Vittorio Colao was biding his time, making it clear he would only sell the 45 percent stake at what he considered the right price. Talks picked up in earnest a few weeks ago, however, as Verizon grew concerned that its window of opportunity may be closing, with interest rates going up and its own stock declining, one of the sources said. Verizon’s stock fell more than 4 percent in August. That prompted Verizon to raise the offer price from the $100 billion it had initially envisioned to around $130 billion, sources have said. Even after the bump in price, the deal is expected to be accretive to earnings, the source said. With 2012 free cash flow of $28.6 billion at Verizon Wireless, RBC Capital Markets analyst Doug Colandrea said earlier that Verizon has the ability to rapidly repay the debt raised to fund the deal. Another hindrance to a deal has been the possibility of a huge tax bill for Vodafone from the sale, based on the massive growth Verizon Wireless has experienced since it was established. But the sources said the deal would be structured in such way that Vodafone’s tax bill could be cut to around $5 billion. Verizon Communications will buy Vodafone’s U.S. holding company, Vodafone Americas, that owns the Verizon Wireless stake and some other assets, the sources said. Verizon will then keep the Verizon Wireless stake and sell European assets back to Vodafone, they said. Since the seller of Vodafone Americas would not be a U.S.-based entity, no U.S. capital gains tax would be due, tax experts have said. And Vodafone may be able to take advantage of Britain’s substantial shareholdings exemption on the money it repatriates. The clause, under certain conditions, exempts from UK corporation taxation any gains realized when one company disposes of shares in another company. The deal is also likely to be a fee bonanza for banks. At a $130 billion price tag, total advisory fees for banks involved would be in the $200 million to $250 million range, according to Freeman estimates. Moreover, banks arranging the financing would get fees as well. Fees for loan syndication could be around 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent of the proceeds raised, according to Freeman.",9012013,http://www.reuters.com/article/verizonwireless/update-3-verizon-vodafone-boards-set-to-vote-on-130-bln-wireless-deal-idUSL2N0GW0PG20130901
491,VZ,"WRAPUP 5-Verizon, Vodafone agree to $130 bln Wireless deal","* Verizon to buy Vodafone’s 45 pct of Verizon Wireless * Ends decade-long standoff between both companies * Vodafone to return 71 percent, or $84 billion, to shareholders * Will be third-largest announced deal of all-time By Kate Holton and Sinead Carew LONDON/SAN DIEGO, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications  agreed on Monday to pay  $130 billion to buy Vodafone Group out of its U.S. wireless business, signing history’s third largest corporate deal announcement to bring an end to an often tense 14-year marriage. The deal in cash and stock will give Verizon full access to the profits from the United States’ largest mobile operator, handing it fresh firepower to invest in its mobile network and fend off challengers in a tough market that is fast becoming even more competitive. For the British group, the accord will allow it to return 71 percent of the net proceeds - or $84 billion including all of the stock - to shareholders while also ramping up investment in its networks to set itself apart from rivals. The deal, in which Verizon will buy Vodafone’s 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless, is the defining event in the careers of Vittorio Colao and Lowell McAdam, the chief executives of Vodafone and Verizon, respectively. They had succeeded in rebuilding relations between the two sides, long strained by clashes about the Wireless dividend and who would eventually seize full ownership. McAdam told Reuters in an interview that the two men had initially discussed the possibility of combining Verizon and Vodafone before deciding that the  stake sale made more sense for both companies. He said the companies realized they were close to a deal after they spent the morning together in a hotel in San Francisco, chatting while on the exercise bike in the gym and later over breakfast. The code name assigned to the deal was Project River. “We were Hudson and they were the Thames,” he said, referring to rivers in New York and London. Under the terms, Vodafone will get $58.9 billion in cash, $60.2 billion in Verizon stock, and an additional $11 billion from smaller transactions in a deal that is due to close in the first quarter of next year. The deal will become the third largest announced deal in the world after Vodafone’s $203 billion takeover of Germany’s Mannesmann in 1999 and AOL’s $181 billion acquisition of Time Warner the following year. Verizon has also managed to raise one of the largest ever financing packages at $60 billion. “We think we have a balanced approach here,” Colao told reporters, adding that he was “super committed” to the next chapter of the company. “We are reducing our debt level which will enable the company to be very robust and take opportunities if they arise.” McAdam said simply that the time was right to buy. “I think there’s going to be a burst of rocket fuel in the Verizon engine as a result of this transaction,” the executive told Reuters. He said it was a self-funding transaction because Verizon’s earnings per share will immediately increase by 10 percent, excluding one-time items. However, the addition of a massive new debt load on Verizon’s books, may tie the company’s hands on major investments for some time as paying down its debt should be a priority, analysts said. “It probably, in the short term at least, limits Verizon’s ability to do other large transactions,” said Macquarie analyst Kevin Smithen. He also worried that Verizon paid too high a price at a time when growth is slowing in the U.S. wireless industry and smaller rivals are competing aggressively on price. In fact, Verizon is not interested in entering the Canadian wireless market, a Verizon spokesman said confirming McAdam’s statements made earlier during an interview with Bloomberg. Moody’s Investors Service downgraded its rating on Verizon after the news to reflect an increase in debt leverage from the addition of about $67 billion of new debt which the credit ratings agency said will more than double Verizon’s debt load to $116 billion. The final agreement follows years of speculation as to whether Vodafone, the world’s second largest mobile operator, would leave or be forced out of the highly successful business. Talks between the two sides picked up in earnest over the summer as Verizon grew concerned that its window of opportunity was closing, with interest rates due to rise and its own stock price declining. That prompted Verizon to raise the offer from the $100 billion it had initially floated to close to Vodafone’s asking price of $130-$135 billion, sources told Reuters. For Colao, the timing was also fortuitous as Europe is showing tentative signs of recovery and the U.S. looks headed for tougher competition after Japan’s SoftBank Corp, a scrappy mobile competitor at home, took control of Sprint Corp  the No. 3 U.S. wireless provider. “Verizon finally got serious about paying a full price and then there was a lot of good will to work it out,” one person familiar with the deal said. “You have a window in the market where you can lock in a lot of funding at historically low interest rates. Part of the concern was that the window may not be there (forever).” Both boards unanimously approved the sale. Since Verizon already had operational control of the wireless company, the deal is not expected to affect its 100 million customers, but its additional financial firepower once it has paid down some of the hefty debt load could help it compete more aggressively against its rivals. However, although Verizon had long said its control of Verizon Wireless was not restricted by Vodafone’s ownership, Forrester analyst Charles Golvin said that the absence of a partner could give Verizon more flexibility in marketing its wireline Internet and television services and its wireless offerings together. “There was always influence even though Verizon might say they had full decision making control,” Golvin said. NEW-LOOK VODAFONE While Vodafone will lose its best asset, it will get a war chest to reward shareholders, pay down debt and bolster its European operations, which are under pressure from recession and tough regulation. It said it planned to launch a new investment phase dubbed “Project Spring,” to improve its mobile and broadband networks across its networks in Europe and emerging markets such as India and South Africa. After making one of the largest shareholder returns in history, Vodafone will be left with a $30 billion cash pile. Some 6 billion pounds ($9 billion) will go to the Project Spring network investment programme and the rest will be used to pay down debt, bringing down leverage to one times forward operating profit (EBITDA). Vodafone spent 6.3 billion pounds on network investment in its last fiscal year, so the further 6 billion pounds spread over three years for Project Spring does represent a significant new effort for the group. Vodafone is not earmarking any of the cash for acquisitions, although Colao said that the group could always borrow later if attractive deal opportunities crop up that would create value for shareholders. Bankers and analysts had expected Vodafone to consider acquisitions in fixed-line assets in Europe after recent deals in Britain and Germany. Both groups said they would now be in a position to increase their dividend. Vodafone will be left with a U.S. tax liability of around $5 billion, which was lower than some analysts expected. This is because Vodafone does not have to pay any tax on the gain in the UK or in the Netherlands, where the Vodafone unit which owns the unit being sold is based. These countries do not levy tax on profits companies make from selling substantial stakes - usually over 10 percent -  in other companies. The tax due in the United States is limited because the seller is a non-U.S. entity. Lead advisers for Verizon were boutique M&A; firm Guggenheim Partners, Morgan Stanley, and Paul Taubman, a former banker at Morgan Stanley. Barclays and Bank of America Merrill Lynch acted as financial advisors to Verizon, and will also underwrite the $61 billion in financing for the bid alongside JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley.

494,VZ,"For Verizon advisers, patience pays off with huge payday","NEW YORK (Reuters) - It has been a 10-year-long wait for bankers advising Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) on its $130 billion deal to take complete control of Verizon Wireless, but their patience will yield both handsome fees and bragging rights. Bankers, including Paul Taubman, Alan Schwartz, Andrew Decker and James Ferency, were among the advisers that Verizon used back in 2004, when it first came close to buying out Vodafone Group Plc’s (VOD.L) 45 percent stake in the No. 1 U.S. mobile carrier, people familiar with the matter said. Since that time much has changed. Taubman, then at Morgan Stanley (MS.N), left the bank earlier this year and is currently working independently. Schwartz was then the CEO of Bear Stearns and Decker and Ferency were bankers at the firm. They have since moved to Guggenheim Partners after Bear became a victim of the financial crisis in 2008 and had to be rescued by JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N). But Verizon turned to the same group of bankers - as well as their current and old firms - to help make its latest run at the deal, which was announced on Monday after last-minute negotiations over a U.S. holiday weekend. The deal, the third-largest corporate acquisition of all time, is estimated to generate M&A; advisory and financing fees of around $500 million and catapult Guggenheim, an independent financial services firm, to the 10th position from 42nd in the global rankings of M&A; advisers. It will also seal the lead of Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and JPMorgan as the top three M&A; advisors globally, according to Thomson Reuters data. JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Barclays Plc (BARC.L) and Bank of America also advised Verizon and arranged the financing for the deal. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and UBS AG UBSN.VX are advising Vodafone. The banks are expected to split total advisory fees of $200 million to $250 million, with about $110 million to $125 million paid by Verizon Communications, and $100 million to $118 million paid by Vodafone, according to financial services firm Freeman & Co estimates. Banks would also earn fees for arranging the financing. Fees for loan syndication could be around 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent of the amount raised. For money raised through bonds, fees would be 0.3 percent to 0.8 percent, according to Freeman. Taubman, the former Morgan Stanley banker, was one of the key negotiators for Verizon, although it was not clear how much of the fee pool he would take personally. In a sign of the importance of the deal to banks, JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman, as well as the bank’s top dealmaker Robert Kindler got personally involved. Last week, before a Verizon board meeting Dimon, Kindler, Schwartz and Taubman talked about the time it had taken for the deal to come together. Kindler and Dimon joked how Morgan Stanley had signed the engagement in 2004 when Taubman was still at the bank, while JPMorgan inherited the advisory role from Bear, thanks to the work done by Schwartz and his team at the time, people familiar with the matter said. “I had some very good CEOs that would give me advice on how to try to get something this complicated and this big done,” Verizon Chief Executive Lowell McAdam told Reuters in an interview on Monday. “It was a good group of gentlemen who all had the right objectives in mind.” The news of Verizon’s latest effort was first reported by Reuters in April. At the time, sources said Verizon was contemplating a $100 billion cash and stock bid. Verizon was ready to push aggressively but preferred a friendly deal. The renewed attempt came as Verizon, which led the U.S. pack in wireless customer growth and profitability, needed new ways to grow. The U.S. market has been slowing because most people already own smartphones and competition has been intensifying. Record low interest rates, thanks to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s unprecedented policy of easy money, also meant that financing for such a large deal would be cheap. Verizon is raising $61 billion in bridge loans for the deal. “At some point in the future, where Vodafone turns around, and says, ‘OK now we’re ready,’ Verizon may be off to do something. Interest rates may be different,” a source said in April. “This is a moment in time, we should not pass.” But Vodafone Chief Executive Vittorio Colao was biding his time, making it clear he would only sell the 45 percent stake at what he considered the right price. Guggenheim bankers helped Verizon to put together key terms of the proposal. Around May, Verizon Chief Executive Lowell McAdam called Taubman for advice as well. McAdam also talked with Dimon, Schwartz, James Gorman and others several times. Taubman joined the deal team after his non-compete agreement with Morgan Stanley expired. The former co-head of Morgan Stanley’s investment bank had left the Wall Street firm earlier this year after it became clear that Gorman planned to choose his long-time rival Colm Kelleher as the sole head of the unit. <ID: nL1E8M54O2> The presence of a senior banker such as Taubman, who spent 27 years at Morgan Stanley as a dealmaker, as an independent adviser is rare in transactions of such size. Last year, former Citigroup (C.N) banker Michael Klein worked as an independent go-between on the Glencore-Xstrata (GLEN.L) merger. “When Paul left Morgan Stanley, he had tremendous amount of corporate knowledge... So I called him up and said: Paul, we may be getting serious here and I’d like to have you back in the game,” McAdam told Reuters. “And he came off the bench and came right in ... it was a big plus.” Talks picked up in earnest about a few weeks ago, as Verizon grew concerned that its window of opportunity may be closing. With the Fed indicating that it would start tapering its massive bond buying program, called quantitative easing, rates looked set to go up. Moreover, Verizon’s own stock has been declining since April, falling more than 4 percent in August alone. That prompted Verizon to bid $130 billion for the stake, up from roughly $100 billion it had envisioned earlier this year. The rest of the details came together over the last month. The two sides spent the Labor Day weekend, typically one of the slowest times of the year for markets, negotiating the final details. The boards met to vote on the deal, leading to the announcement on Monday.

The deal, the third-largest corporate acquisition of all time, is estimated to generate M&A; advisory and financing fees of around $500 million and catapult Guggenheim, an independent financial services firm, to the 10th position from 42nd in the global rankings of M&A; advisers. It will also seal the lead of Goldman Sachs Group Inc , Bank of America Corp and JPMorgan as the top three M&A; advisors globally, according to Thomson Reuters data. JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Barclays Plc and Bank of America also advised Verizon and arranged the financing for the deal. Goldman Sachs Group Inc and UBS AG are advising Vodafone. The banks are expected to split total advisory fees of $200 million to $250 million, with about $110 million to $125 million paid by Verizon Communications, and $100 million to $118 million paid by Vodafone, according to financial services firm Freeman & Co estimates. Banks would also earn fees for arranging the financing. Fees for loan syndication could be around 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent of the amount raised. For money raised through bonds, fees would be 0.3 percent to 0.8 percent, according to Freeman. Taubman, the former Morgan Stanley banker, was one of the key negotiators for Verizon, although it was not clear how much of the fee pool he would take personally. In a sign of the importance of the deal to banks, JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman, as well as the bank’s top dealmaker Robert Kindler got personally involved. Last week, before a Verizon board meeting Dimon, Kindler, Schwartz and Taubman talked about the time it had taken for the deal to come together. Kindler and Dimon joked how Morgan Stanley had signed the engagement in 2004 when Taubman was still at the bank, while JPMorgan inherited the advisory role from Bear, thanks to the work done by Schwartz and his team at the time, people familiar with the matter said. “I had some very good CEOs that would give me advice on how to try to get something this complicated and this big done,” Verizon Chief Executive Lowell McAdam told Reuters in an interview on Monday. “It was a good group of gentlemen who all had the right objectives in mind.” The news of Verizon’s latest effort was first reported by Reuters in April. At the time, sources said Verizon was contemplating a $100 billion cash and stock bid. Verizon was ready to push aggressively but preferred a friendly deal. The renewed attempt came as Verizon, which led the U.S. pack in wireless customer growth and profitability, needed new ways to grow. The U.S. market has been slowing because most people already own smartphones and competition has been intensifying. Record low interest rates, thanks to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s unprecedented policy of easy money, also meant that financing for such a large deal would be cheap. Verizon is raising $61 billion in bridge loans for the deal. “At some point in the future, where Vodafone turns around, and says, ‘OK now we’re ready,’ Verizon may be off to do something. Interest rates may be different,” a source said in April. “This is a moment in time, we should not pass.” But Vodafone Chief Executive Vittorio Colao was biding his time, making it clear he would only sell the 45 percent stake at what he considered the right price. Guggenheim bankers helped Verizon to put together key terms of the proposal. Around May, Verizon Chief Executive Lowell McAdam called Taubman for advice as well. McAdam also talked with Dimon, Schwartz, James Gorman and others several times. Taubman joined the deal team after his non-compete agreement with Morgan Stanley expired. The former co-head of Morgan Stanley’s investment bank had left the Wall Street firm earlier this year after it became clear that Gorman planned to choose his long-time rival Colm Kelleher as the sole head of the unit. [ID: nL1E8M54O2] The presence of a senior banker such as Taubman, who spent 27 years at Morgan Stanley as a dealmaker, as an independent adviser is rare in transactions of such size. Last year, former Citigroup banker Michael Klein worked as an independent go-between on the Glencore-Xstrata merger. “When Paul left Morgan Stanley, he had tremendous amount of corporate knowledge... So I called him up and said: Paul, we may be getting serious here and I’d like to have you back in the game,” McAdam told Reuters. “And he came off the bench and came right in ... it was a big plus.” Talks picked up in earnest about a few weeks ago, as Verizon grew concerned that its window of opportunity may be closing. With the Fed indicating that it would start tapering its massive bond buying program, called quantitative easing, rates looked set to go up. Moreover, Verizon’s own stock has been declining since April, falling more than 4 percent in August alone. That prompted Verizon to bid $130 billion for the stake, up from roughly $100 billion it had envisioned earlier this year. The rest of the details came together over the last month. The two sides spent the Labor Day weekend, typically one of the slowest times of the year for markets, negotiating the final details. The boards met to vote on the deal, leading to the announcement on Monday.",9022013,http://www.reuters.com/article/vodafone-deal-ma-tables/update-2-for-verizon-advisers-patience-pays-off-with-huge-payday-idUSL6N0GY39920130902

499,VZ,Vodafone-Verizon deal a boon for bulge bracket banks,"LONDON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Vodafone’s $130 billion sale of its 45 percent stake in Verizon’s U.S. wireless business has cemented the position of large U.S. investment banks at the top of the M&A; league table and give European peers a boost. Long-time Vodafone adviser Goldman Sachs will remain top of the league table ranking advisers on worldwide M&A; so far this year, having worked on 241 deals worth $476 billion including the Verizon deal, Thomson Reuters data estimates. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley will retain their second, third and fourth spots respectively, working with Verizon both in an advisory role and committing  $61 billion in financing to fund the cash portion of the deal. Barclays, which has also worked with Verizon, will benefit from the highest move up the rankings, from eighth to fifth. The four banks are also advising Verizon, along with former Morgan Stanley banker Paul Taubman and Guggenheim Partners, which will move from 42nd position to 10th. UBS, which also advised the Vodafone camp, will move from tenth position currently to sixth. Although overall M&A; activity remains lower than at this time last year, the telecom sector has been a bright spot for deal-making. According to Thomson Reuters data, telecom deals were up 28 percent this year, with 413 deals worth $94.3 billion, not including the Verizon-Vodafone deal. The newly announced deal has now taken telecom deals activity up to $224.3 billion this year, a 202 percent increase compared to the same period last year and the highest annual total of M&A; in the sector since 2006. The transaction is also likely to be a fee bonanza for banks. At a $130 billion price tag, total advisory fees for banks involved would be in the $200 million to $250 million range, according to Freeman estimates. Goldman Sachs also ranks number one in terms of fees earned so far this year for completed mergers and acquisitions, taking in $983 million, excluding the Vodafone-Verizon deal, Thomson Reuters data calculates. Even with this mega transaction, investment banking fees for M&A; activity globally so far this year still remain the lowest since the same period in 2009, totalling $11.2 billion. Banks arranging the financing would get fees as well. Fees for loan syndication could be around 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent of the proceeds raised, according to Freeman.",9022013,http://www.reuters.com/article/vodafone-deal-ma-tables/vodafone-verizon-deal-a-boon-for-bulge-bracket-banks-idUSL6N0GY1VO20130902
500,VZ,"Verizon, Vodafone say agree to $130 billion Verizon Wireless deal","(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) said on Monday it has agreed to buy out Vodafone Group Plc’s (VOD.L) 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless for $130 billion, capping its decade-long effort to win full control of the most profitable mobile service provider in the United States. Under the terms of the deal, Vodafone would get $58.9 billion in cash, $60.2 billion in Verizon stock, and an additional $11 billion from smaller transactions that would take the total deal value to $130 billion, Verizon said in a statement. The boards of Verizon and Vodafone have unanimously approved the sale, which is subject to customary closing conditions, and was expected to close in the first quarter of 2014. Verizon said it expects the transaction to be immediately accretive to earnings per share by about 10 percent, without any one-time adjustments. The deal marks the third-largest announced acquisition in corporate history and British telecom giant Vodafone’s exit from the large but mature U.S. mobile market. Verizon also said its board declared a quarterly dividend of 53 cents per share, an increase of 1.5 cents, or 2.9 percent, from the previous quarter. On an annual basis, the hike raises Verizon’s dividend 6 cents, from $2.06 to $2.12 per share.

501,VZ,UPDATE 2-Verizon to roadshow potential record bond issue next week,"By Danielle Robinson and Michelle Sierra NEW YORK/LONDON, Sept 3 (IFR/LPC) - Verizon Communications could steal the record from Apple  for the biggest bond issue ever to hit the global markets in coming weeks, as it begins the process of raising US$50bn of bonds to pay for part of the US$130bn price take on the 45% stake in Verizon Wireless that it is buying from Vodafone. Sources in the corporate bond market said they were hearing a US dollar deal is on its way and could be as big as US$20bn, beating even the US$17bn multi-tranche offering by Apple in April. Verizon will begin roadshowing a deal on September 9 and 10 in the US and then move to Europe for investor meetings from September 13-17. Bookrunners for the roadshow are JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Barclays. The first offering is expected to be just in dollars and because of its size will include every possible tenor across the yield curve, with floating rate tranches as well as fixed rate portions at the shorter end. The proceeds of the first deal will go toward paying down a record US$61bn bridge loan, again by JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Barclays. The US$61bn 364-day bridge loan will be refinanced with a permanent capital structure, consisting of US$49bn of corporate bonds and US$12bn of three and five-year term  loans. Verizon is also raising an additional us$2bn revolver, but it is not expected to be drawn, according to Thomson Reuters LPC. Some of the US$61bn bridge loan may be drawn and funded as Verizon may be unable to issue the full US$49bn of bonds by the first quarter of 2014, when the underlying acquisition is expected to close, due to the size of the deal. In an 8K filing, Verizon stated the US$130bn would be paid for in the form of US$58.89bn in cash, US$60.15bn in stock, US$5bn of senior unsecured notes, the transfer of Verizon’s indirectly owned 23.1% interest in Vodafone Omnitel worth US$3.5bn and US$2.5bn in assumed debt. The 8K said Verizon has the right to increase the cash portion of the purchase price by US$15bn if it wants.  Verizon CDS are 2.5bp wider at 85.5. Verizon’s cash bond spreads have barely reacted to the news, indicating a receptive investor audience for the deluge of bonds on the way. Verizon 2.45% November 2022s were trading at 133bp bid today, just 3bp wider than late last week and 8bp wider than the 125bp bid level before details of acquisition were leaked. A widening of 8bp is considered negligible given the level of bond issuance that Verizon is expected to do.",9032013,http://www.reuters.com/article/verizon-bond/update-2-verizon-to-roadshow-potential-record-bond-issue-next-week-idUSL2N0GZ1KX20130903

Both the S&P; 500 and Nasdaq rallied to the tune of more than 1 percent in the early stages of trading after Obama decided to seek congressional authorization before taking military action, a move likely to shelve any strike for at least several days. Both John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, and Eric Cantor, the House Republican majority leader, pledged support for military action in Syria after a meeting on Tuesday at the White House. Boehner urged his colleagues in Congress to do the same. Nancy Pelosi, Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, said she believes Congress will support a resolution authorizing the use of U.S. military force against Syria. “The worry is Syria could turn ugly,” said Jeffrey Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James Financial in St. Petersburg, Florida. Equities have recently been pressured by the prospect of a Western strike against Syria after chemical weapons were used to kill civilians, sending the S&P; down 1.8 percent last week and down 3.1 percent for August. Congress returns from its summer recess on Sept. 9, and any vote to authorize a strike will come after that. U.S. crude futures rose 0.9 percent. Oil spiked 2.5 percent in August, largely driven by concerns that military action in the Middle East would disrupt crude supplies. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 6.86 points or 0.05 percent, to 14,803.45, the S&P; 500 gained 4.38 points or 0.27 percent, to 1,637.35 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 17.409 points or 0.48 percent, to 3,607.278. Verizon Communications agreed on Monday to pay $130 billion to buy Vodafone Group  out of its U.S. wireless business, ending an often tense 14-year marriage. Verizon lost 2.7 percent to $46.10 while U.S. shares of Vodafone shed 2.3 percent to $31.61. Nokia Corp agreed to sell its handset business to Microsoft Corp for $7.2 billion, sending its U.S. shares up 29.7 percent to $5.06 on record volume.  Microsoft fell 5.8 percent to $31.45, the biggest drag on both the Dow and S&P; 500. In the latest economic data, the Institute for Supply Management’s August manufacturing index came in at 55.7, above expectations for a reading of 54.

503,VZ,"Verizon eyes overseas assets, spectrum, paying down debt","(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc said on Tuesday that it could expand internationally or buy more spectrum in coming years even while it pays down debt from its $130 billion purchase of Vodafone Group Plc’s 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless. Verizon shares fell as much as 4.8 percent as investors reacted to the financial terms of the acquisition, which was announced on Monday, a U.S. public holiday when financial markets are closed. On a conference call with analysts on Tuesday, Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said Verizon should still participate in upcoming wireless airwaves auctions, despite a plan to take on more than $60 billion in new debt to pay for Verizon Wireless. Spectrum is key to supporting increasing demand for wireless data services. While Chief Executive Officer Lowell McAdam ruled out an expansion into Canada’s wireless market, which the company had previously considered, he said it would look at other international opportunities, as its wireline business already has overseas assets. The executives also said the company would pay down the debt from the Vodafone deal “as quickly as possible” and that they hoped to return Verizon to its previous investment-grade credit rating in four to five years. Providing a strong dividend to Verizon shareholders would remain a priority, McAdam said. Along with the deal with Vodafone, Verizon announced an 2.9 percent increase to its payout on Monday. Some analysts had said they were worried that Verizon’s hands would be tied on any additional spectrum purchases or corporate acquisitions while it concentrates on paying off debt. Verizon is taking full ownership of the wireless venture so it can get a 100 percent of the profits from the business. It expects this to increase its earnings per share by 10 percent after debt interest payments and a $60.2 billion equity stake that Verizon is giving to Vodafone shareholders. But some investors had hoped the deal would generate a bigger boost to Verizon’s earnings. Before the announcement, Citi analyst Michael Rollins had estimated the profit increase at as much as 19 percent. “It’s a little less accretive than we expected,” said Evercore analyst Jonathan Schildkraut, who had forecast an earnings boost of 11 percent to 16 percent. Schildkraut said Verizon’s growth target and the $130 billion deal price were giving some investors pause as an April Reuters report had Verizon preparing a $100 billion bid. But Schildkraut, who had expected a price tag of $125 billion to $133 billion, said the final figure made sense for Verizon. He pegged the $130 billion at 8.8 times his estimate for Verizon’s 2013 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. By comparison, he said, AT&T; Inc recently agreed to pay a multiple of 8.1 times EBITDA for Leap Wireless International Inc, a much weaker asset than U.S. market leader Verizon Wireless. Another concern about the deal is expected volatility of Verizon shares since many Vodafone investors, because of their firms’ investment policies, will probably have to sell the U.S. stock, Schildkraut said. Shammo told analysts that the shares should settle down within about 90 days or so after the deal closes, which is expected in the first quarter of 2014. McAdam said full ownership of Verizon Wireless would help Verizon more easily integrate its wireless and wireline networks. This would help the company offer services like mobile commerce, mobile video and mobile advertising, which need both wireless and wireline network support, he said. But Schildkraut was unimpressed by this suggestion. “Management presented a compelling financial reason for the transaction but they didn’t make the strongest argument for the strategic rationale,” he said. McAdam had said on Monday that he decided against a full merger with Vodafone because just buying the Verizon Wireless stake made more sense. The deal requires the approval of Verizon and Vodafone shareholders. Shares of Verizon were down 2.9 percent at $45.99 in afternoon trading after falling as low as $45.08 earlier on Tuesday. The stock had reached a peak of $54.30 at the end of April. In London, Vodafone shares dropped 5 percent.

Indexes pared initial gains, however, after comments from several congressional leaders indicated support for Obama. Obama, during a meeting with congressional leaders at the White House, called for a prompt vote on Capitol Hill and reiterated that the U.S. plan would be limited in scope and not repeat the long U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Both John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, and Eric Cantor, the House Republican majority leader, said they would support President Barack Obama’s call for military action in Syria. Boehner urged his colleagues in Congress to do the same. Nancy Pelosi, Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, said she believes Congress will support a resolution authorizing the use of U.S. military force against Syria. “It’s going to go up and down based on the expectations of when it is going to happen, but something is going to happen,” said Uri Landesman, President at Platinum Partners in New York. “You will see it trade down into the speculation and then once it actually happens, assuming it’s not too big, you’ll see a rally.

507,VZ,Vodafone pummels UK FTSE on payout disappointment,"* FTSE 100 down 0.3 pct to 6,485.90 pts * Vodafone falls as terms of joint venture sale fuel profit taking * Miners and HSBC higher on Chinese data boost By Francesco Canepa LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Britain’s top share index traded lower on Tuesday, weighed down by Vodafone after the terms of the telecoms giant’s sale of its U.S. mobile stake to U.S. partner Verizon disappointed some investors. Vodafone, Britain’s fifth largest stock in terms of market capitalisation, fell 4.8 percent, giving back over a third of its rise since Thursday. It knocked 19.3 points off the FTSE 100 , which traded 20.3 points lower, or 0.3 percent, at 6,485.90 points. While the telecoms firm said the deal with Verizon would allow it to return $84 billion of the net proceeds of the deal to shareholders, the division of that payout between shares and cash is capped. “The cash element of the payout is probably less than expected,” Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said. “For shareholders there is also the strange situation that, while Vodafone has cut ties with Verizon, they (the investors) haven’t, so some of the institutional shareholders could be taking this early opportunity (to cash in), especially if they can’t hold U.S. stocks in their portfolio.” Simon Maughan, strategist at Olivetree calculates the payout structure means Vodafone shareholders will not benefit from any strength in Verizon’s shares until the stock has rallied 7.6 percent, while they wear most of the potential downside. Beyond this, stocks exposed to China such as miners  and bank HSBC were among the top gainers, after China’s services sector grew steadily in August as domestic demand picked up, official data showed on Tuesday. Volume on the FTSE was thin at 78 percent of its average for the past three months, with Vodafone a notable exception at 2-1/2 times its volume average. “With Chinese data encouraging, we remain optimistic for the market in terms of absolute growth,” said Atif Latif, director at Guardian stockbrokers, who expected the FTSE to push to 6,875 points, a high tested in May and previously seen in 1999.

Asked whether the government might therefore push back the auction timetable, a spokeswoman for Industry Minister James Moore said: “We are moving forward with the spectrum auction as planned.”",9032013,http://www.reuters.com/article/canada-telecoms-auction/canada-says-wireless-spectrum-auction-to-go-ahead-as-planned-idUSO8N0DX00J20130903
509,VZ,RLPC: Verizon details pricing on $61B bridge loan,"NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Pricing details have emerged on the $61 billion, 364-day bridge loan backing Verizon Communications Inc’s $130 billion acquisition of the 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless that it does not already own from Vodafone Group Plc, according to a filing. The bridge loan includes a $12 billion bridge to term loans portion and a $49 billion bridge to bonds. JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Barclays are joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners on the financing, which was underwritten equally among the four banks and backs the cash portion of the acquisition. JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley are global coordinators of the financing. JP Morgan is the administrative agent. Each bank contributed $3 billion to the tranche A and $12.25 billion to the tranche B. The company will pay 150bp over Libor if it draws on its new $61 billion bridge loan, banking sources said. If the facility remains undrawn, the company will pay a commitment fee of 10bp. Drawn pricing is based on current ratings of Baa1/BBB+. Pricing is based on the company’s ratings. If the company’s ratings rise to A3/A-, the company would pay 125bp over Libor on drawn portions of the loan. If ratings fall below Baa2/BBB, drawn pricing would rise to 200bp over Libor. The loans pay a 10bp ticking fee while undrawn. The maturity of the $25 billion in loans can be extended past the maturity date subject to lender approval. As previously reported, the four banks have started talking to Verizon’s other senior relationship banks that are expected to become co-arrangers of the giant bridge loan. Some of the bridge loan may also be sold to relationship banks in general syndication. General syndication of the $2 billion revolving credit is expected to launch next week. The $12 billion term loans will be split evenly between a three-year loan and a five-year loan, sources said. Verizon’s existing $6.2 billion, four-year revolving credit will remain in place. The $61 billion bridge loan will be refinanced with a permanent capital structure consisting of $49 billion of corporate bonds and $14 billion of loans, including a $2 billion revolving credit and $12 billion of term loans. Some of the $61 billion bridge loan may be drawn and funded as Verizon may be unable to issue the full $49 billion of bonds by the first quarter of 2014, when the underlying acquisition is expected to close due to the size of the deal. Verizon said on Monday that it had entered into a definitive agreement with Vodafone Group Plc to acquire Vodafone’s U.S. group with the principal asset of 45 percent of Verizon Wireless. The purchase consideration of $130 billion consists of a combination of cash, Verizon common stock and other items. Verizon will pay Vodafone $58.9 billion in cash.",9032013,http://www.reuters.com/article/verizon-pricing/rlpc-verizon-details-pricing-on-61b-bridge-loan-idUSL2N0GZ0L820130903
510,VZ,US STOCKS-Futures imply steep gains; potential Syria action delayed,"* Obama to seek congressional authorization for Syria action * Verizon falls in premarket, agrees to a deal with Vodafone * Nokia ADRs soar in premarket on deal with Microsoft * Futures up: Dow 105 pts, S&P; 14.7 pts, Nasdaq 20.25 pts By Ryan Vlastelica NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures pointed to a sharply higher open on Tuesday after U.S. President Barack Obama opted to seek congressional authorization for military action against Syria, a move that was likely to delay any strike for at least several days. Equities have recently been pressured by the prospect of a Western strike against Syria after chemical weapons were used to kill civilians. The geopolitical uncertainty contributed to steep losses in August, which marked the worst month for the S&P; 500 since May 2012. Congress returns from its summer recess on Sept. 9, and any vote to authorize a strike will come after that. While Obama has been pushing Congress to back his plan, passage is by no means certain, further easing concerns over an imminent strike. “There was tremendous fear going into the weekend that the worst-case scenario, some kind of military action, would occur. Now the market is breathing a sigh of relief,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York. U.S. crude futures dipped 0.3 percent. Oil spiked 2.5 percent in August, largely driven by concerns that military action in the Middle East would impact crude supplies. “It isn’t as though the threat has gone away, but the fall in oil prices is helping to alleviate pressure,” Sarhan said. Verizon Communications agreed on Monday to pay $130 billion to buy Vodafone Group  out of its U.S. wireless business, bringing an end to an often tense 14-year marriage. Shares of Verizon, a Dow component, fell 4.8 percent to $45.10 in premarket trading while U.S. shares of Vodafone lost 1.5 percent to $31.87. Also in deal news, Nokia Corp agreed to sell its handset business to Microsoft Corp for $7.2 billion, sending its U.S. shares up 44 percent to $5.62 before the bell. Microsoft fell 5.1 percent to $31.69. S&P; 500 futures rose 14.7 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures added 105 points and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 20.25 points. The U.S. stock market was closed on Monday for Labor Day and trading volume could continue its recent trend of being light with many traders away for the holiday. In the S&P;, investors will be watching the 100-day moving average at 1,639.42, which the index has been unable to close above since Aug. 26. Holding over that level would be a positive sign of near-term momentum. While the uncertainty related to Syria has been the market’s primary driver in recent sessions, investors will also pay close attention to the latest economic data, which could provide some insight into when the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin to slow its monetary stimulus program. The Institute for Supply Management’s August manufacturing sector data is due at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT) with analysts expecting the main index to fall to 54 from 55.4 last month. July construction spending is also scheduled for release at 10 a.m., and is seen rising 0.3 percent. Shares of J.C. Penney Co rose 1.8 percent to $12.70 in premarket trading after Hayman Capital reported a 5.2 percent passive stake in the retailer. CBS Corp on Monday reached an agreement with Time Warner Cable Inc to end a month-long blackout of its stations in New York, Los Angeles and Dallas. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Shares of CBS rose 1.8 percent to $52.01 before the bell. H&R; Block is the only S&P; 500 company scheduled to report quarterly results on Tuesday. Wall Street stocks have been coming off an extended period of weakness, with all three major indexes falling more than 1 percent last week and notching steep losses in August.",9032013,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-usa-stocks/us-stocks-futures-imply-steep-gains-potential-syria-action-delayed-idUSL2N0GZ0HI20130903
511,VZ,"UPDATE 1-Canada won't alter spectrum rules, mute on possible bidders","By Leila Lemghalef SAINT-HUBERT, Quebec, Sept 4 (Reuters) - The rules for Canada’s forthcoming auction of wireless spectrum will stay the same despite the decision by U.S. telecoms giant Verizon Communications Inc not to take part, Industry Minister James Moore said on Wednesday. Canada is selling off four blocks of particularly valuable wireless spectrum next January. The Conservative government, which wants to boost competition, says the big three Canadian telecommunications firms can only bid for one of the blocks while new entrants can go for up to two. Ottawa had hoped a major firm like Verizon would enter the Canadian market, which would likely have boosted bids while also potentially driving down prices for consumers. Verizon said on Monday it was not interested, putting Ottawa’s strategy in some doubt. But Moore suggested other foreign players may still be interested. “Certainly the news from this week - Verizon choosing not to enter the Canadian marketplace - will cause incumbent players and possibly players from outside of Canada to look at the auction,” Moore said. Companies wishing to take part in the January 2014 auction have to register their interest by Sept. 17. “We are not changing dates, we are not changing our policy, we are moving forward and we’ll see which firms choose to present in the auction in January,” Moore told reporters after making an announcement in the Quebec town of Saint-Hubert. He declined to speculate on which firms might bid. The government wants a fourth player in every region of Canada to take on BCE Inc, Rogers Communications Inc  and Telus Corp, who between them have around 90 percent of the domestic market. The three firms say Ottawa’s tactics, including rules limiting access to spectrum, are unfair. But Moore reiterated the Conservative government’s view that more competition is needed. “We can do better as a country. We are a G8 (Group of Eight) nation and we pay almost the highest costs in the world for wireless and we can do better for our consumers,” said Moore. Verizon had at one stage considered using either Canadian telecom startup Mobilicity and its larger rival Wind Mobile - partly owned by European telecom giant Vimpelcom - as a way of entering the market, sources told Reuters in June.",9042013,http://www.reuters.com/article/canada-telecoms/update-1-canada-wont-alter-spectrum-rules-mute-on-possible-bidders-idUSL2N0H017F20130904
512,VZ,Summer deals lift banks' hopes of M&A; tipping point,"LONDON, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Verizon’s deal to buy Vodafone out of their U.S. wireless venture for $130 billion may have been years in the making, but bankers hope it could be an inflexion point that marks the revival of big dealmaking. The telecoms deal, the third-biggest takeover on record, crowns a string of transactions this summer that the bankers say could boost boards’ confidence that the time is right to pursue transformational M&A.; “This has been a great summer to remember,” said Hernan Cristerna, global co-head of M&A; at JP Morgan, which advised Verizon and also helped Nokia with its decision to sell its mobile phone business to Microsoft , announced on Tuesday. “We have to be slightly cautious, but what these deals signal is that there’s a shift in sentiment. We’re changing gears in the M&A; mindset.” In the wake of the 2007-09 financial crisis, dealmaking declined and executives shied away from large leveraged transactions, cutting debt instead and slimming down to their core businesses through asset disposals. Big became synonymous with greater risk and lower performance. After a slow start, the summer’s activity has pushed global M&A; activity across all sectors to $1.55 trillion so far this year, up 1 percent on the same period last year. The telecoms, media and technology (TMT) sector has led the charge. “This could be the beginning of a big wave of M&A; in the TMT sector; we are beginning to see a shifting of the telco tectonic plates globally,” said Eric Benedict, Co-Head TMT at AlixPartners in London. “There has been a lot of action in the U.S., but more could start happening in Europe,” said Benedict. TMT was already the biggest contributor to M&A; activity in the first half of 2013, and Vodafone-Verizon has taken the total to $447.9 billion, more than two thirds higher than last year and making 2013 the best year for TMT dealmaking since 2007, according to Thomson Reuters data. “There are really punchy, ‘life’s great’ sort of deals going on, but they’re really sector specific,” said Tom Massey, head of European M&A; at Citi. “But like in past cycles, once one domino goes, the rest fall.” Data also show reasons for optimism, with 15 deals above $10 billion so far this year, the highest number since 2009, according to Thomson Reuters data. “The acid test for the M&A; market is beyond the natural evolutions of add-ons. It’s about seeing M&A; used to transform rather than just add on or peel off,” said Cristerna. Bankers say companies and their shareholders are warming to more weather-changing deals. “Companies are dusting off some deals they have been studying for a long time. In addition to divestiture of non-core assets and bolt-on acquisitions, CEOs are starting to look at large industry-transforming strategic transactions,” said Gilberto Pozzi, head of European M&A; at Goldman Sachs. The acquisition of Telecom Italia is among the long-expected deals that could soon happen, as the firm is being circled by potential investors including China’s Hutchison Whampoa and Egyptian media tycoon Naguib Sawiris, bankers say. In the UK, the owners of mobile operator EE could also sell it to leveraged buyout funds or trade players like AT&T; in what would be a 10-12 billion pound ($16-20 billion) deal, bankers say. Long-flagged sizeable takeover targets in the pharmaceutical field such as Shire, Astrazeneca and private equity-owned Smith & Nephew could also change hands. Buoyant financing markets could facilitate larger transactions and encourage some to take companies back into private hands, deals that have been largely confined to the United States, with Dell, Virgin and Heinz, say the bankers. “The level of M&A; activity seen to date has not sated the demand for acquisition-related loan deals from loan investors,” said Charlotte Conlan, head of loan syndications for EMEA at BNP Paribas. “Bank liquidity remains deep, easy to access and flexible for the right deal. The much-talked-about M&A; uptick is what the loan market is looking for.” Industrials conglomerates such as Smiths Group and consumer group Reckitt Benckiser are also on bankers’ radar as possible break-up candidates. With the Vodafone-Verizon announcement, 2013 would be the best year for mega-deals - those over $50 billion - since 2008, according to TR data. There have been only seven such deals since 2007. “This could be kicking off broader M&A; activity in other sectors. Everybody will be pitching like crazy. Mega-deals are outliers, though; the universe of possible mega-deals is limited, and they’re what people remember, but the vast majority of deals that take place are in the $1-5 billion bracket. 2013 could be the year that kicked it all off,” said Massey. Ultimately, CEOs need to pull the trigger, and that could be as much about psychology as funding or commercial logic. “Will people be bold enough to do transformational deals? That’s very specific to particular companies, but it’s easier to do when there is an encouraging environment,” said Mark Warham, head of M&A; for EMEA at Barclays.",9042013,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL6N0H01KV20130904

515,VZ,Verizon sued by shareholder over $130 billion Vodafone deal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc has been sued by a shareholder seeking to void its $130 billion buyout of Vodafone Group Plc’s stake in the companies’ wireless joint venture on the grounds the price is too high. In a lawsuit filed in a New York state court on Thursday, just three days after the transaction was announced, Natalie Gordon said Verizon shareholders are being “shortchanged” by the purchase of Vodafone’s 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless, the largest U.S. mobile phone operator. Verizon, which owns the other 55 percent, agreed to pay Vodafone $59 billion in cash, $60 billion in stock and other sums. Verizon Wireless has about 100 million customers. Gordon said “it is evident that Verizon has overpaid,” adding that “Wall Street analysts concur” and that Moody’s Investors Service downgraded Verizon’s credit. She also pointed to a drop in Verizon’s share price to $45.08 on September 3, the first trading day after the purchase was announced, from a peak of $48.60 on August 29, when news that Verizon and Vodafone had revived talks surfaced. The lawsuit characterized the 7.2 percent decline as “almost 10%.” The lawsuit seeks class-action status, and also names Verizon Chief Executive Lowell McAdam and 12 directors as defendants, accusing them of breaching their fiduciary duties. It seeks to force Verizon to rescind the purchase or improve the terms, and force the individual defendants to pay damages. “We believe this lawsuit is entirely without merit, and Verizon intends to defend itself vigorously,” Randal Milch, Verizon executive vice president and general counsel, said in a statement. Vodafone, which is not a defendant, declined to comment. Gordon is represented by law firm Faruqi & Faruqi, and has within the last five years been a shareholder plaintiff in several other lawsuits filed by that firm, court records show. Juan Monteverde, a partner at the New York-based firm, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Verizon-Vodafone transaction would be the third-largest in corporate history, and end their 14-year joint venture. Talks resumed in earnest this summer as Verizon grew concerned that rising interest rates might make a transaction too pricey. The price rose from the $100 billion that Verizon had earlier floated, people familiar with the matter said. Moody’s one-notch downgrade left Verizon’s long-term credit rating at “Baa1,” a low investment grade, reflecting the company’s plan to add $67 billion of debt and more than double its debt load.

Gordon said “it is evident that Verizon has overpaid,” adding that “Wall Street analysts concur” and that Moody’s Investors Service downgraded Verizon’s credit. She also pointed to a drop in Verizon’s share price to $45.08 on Sept. 3, the first trading day after the purchase was announced, from a peak of $48.60 on Aug. 29, when news that Verizon and Vodafone had revived talks surfaced. The lawsuit characterized the 7.2 percent decline as “almost 10%.” The lawsuit seeks class-action status, and also names Verizon Chief Executive Lowell McAdam and 12 directors as defendants, accusing them of breaching their fiduciary duties. It seeks to force Verizon to rescind the purchase or improve the terms, and force the individual defendants to pay damages. A Verizon spokesman declined to comment immediately. Vodafone, which is not a defendant, also declined to comment. Gordon is represented by law firm Faruqi & Faruqi, and has within the last five years been a shareholder plaintiff in several other lawsuits filed by that firm, court records show. Juan Monteverde, a partner at the New York-based firm, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Verizon-Vodafone transaction would be the third-largest in corporate history, and end their 14-year joint venture. Talks resumed in earnest this summer as Verizon grew concerned that rising interest rates might make a transaction too pricey. The price rose from the $100 billion that Verizon had earlier floated, people familiar with the matter said. Moody’s one-notch downgrade left Verizon’s long-term credit rating at “Baa1,” a low investment grade, reflecting the company’s plan to add $67 billion of debt and more than double its debt load. Nonetheless, Moody’s ratings outlook is “stable.” The case is Gordon v.

519,VZ,REFILE-Verizon plans record-breaking bond as early as Wednesday,"* Blockbuster deal expected to be biggest corporate bond * Rising Treasury rates prompts greater urgency * Company seen weighting deal heavily to medium, long-end By Danielle Robinson NEW YORK, Sept 6 (IFR) - Verizon Communications is set to hit the bond market with a record-breaking issue of anywhere from US$20bn to US$30bn as early as Wednesday, after Treasury rates soared to levels not seen since 2011. The 10-year Treasury rate hit 3.00% for the first time since July 2011 in late afternoon trading on Thursday, sending panic signals out to Verizon and other potential issuers that their cost of capital could blow out and their investor audience dissipate if they do not move immediately. “Given what interest rates are doing, they will want to announce the deal immediately after they wrap up their investor meetings Tuesday,” said one banker. “That could mean a deal announcement next Wednesday or Thursday if market conditions allow.” Verizon’s concern is not just the rising cost of its own funding, but the shrinking size of potential demand with every basis point increase in Treasury yields. “The tricky part is that if rates drift higher, there may just be less dollars available to invest overall, as investors move from bonds to cash or more defensive positions versus rates,” said Matt Duch, senior portfolio manager at Calvert Investment Management. “Overall market weakness will make any Verizon deal smaller than it would’ve been a few weeks ago.” Investors who have already been sounded out about the deal were left with the impression the company was targeting a deal of at least US$20bn and would take out as much as US$30bn given the opportunity, before moving to the euro and sterling markets the following week. A London-based banking source also gave a Wednesday/Thursday timeline, adding that the group was likely to raise up to US$30bn before pricing 7-, 12- and 20-year bonds in euros and 20- and 25-year bonds in sterling. Deals in more niche currencies could follow too, the source said. The company has served notice that it plans to raise US$50bn in total in the bond markets to help finance its US$130bn purchase of the 45% stake in Verizon Wireless it does not already own. Some investors think the initial deal may even end up as large as US$35bn, though many bankers away from the deal think a US$20bn-$30bn deal is more likely. Observers believe the company is hoping to weight the deal size heavily at the intermediate and long end, in 10 and 30-year notes. Short-dated and floating-rate tranches are also expected, but rumours have circulated that Verizon may also include a 20-year or even a 100-year portion. Investors dumped not just Verizon bonds last Thursday, but also those of AT&T; as they prepared to buy the new bonds without adding duration or exposure to the name or sector. On Thursday Verizon’s 2.45% 2022 bonds gapped out more than 25bp to Treasuries plus 160bp, making them 35bp-40bp wider than before news of the acquisition broke. Investors have, nonetheless, responded with a resounding “yes” to whatever Verizon wants to issue, bankers said. “But they have to price it right so that you have no choice but to participate,” said Duch. Market players heard on Thursday that bookrunners Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley were putting a 200bp number in investors’ heads as a starting point for conversations on the spread level for a new 10-year deal. Although that number may be radically different by Monday, depending on market conditions, those suggestions served notice that Verizon was willing to do what it takes to get its deal done. Something around 200bp for a new 10-year is 30bp wider than the 170bp G-spread on the 2022s on Thursday, and 60bp wider than 140bp G-spread at the end of August. “You could see a situation where they start socialising at around the 200bp level,” said a syndicate manager not involved in the transaction. “They might then announce initial price thoughts a little wider, like around 205bp or 212.5bp, to capture demand.” Apart from the problem of rising rates, Verizon also has to contend with its ratings drop. Many large investors, such as security lenders, may not participate because the company is no longer Single A rated. “Everyone is aware that going from Triple B to Double B means you lose a lot of investors, but it also happens when you drop from Single A into the Triple B space,” said Michael Collins, senior investment manager at Prudential. Verizon’s deal will also come up against a considerable amount of competing supply running ahead of its deal. Sprint, for instance, last week hit the market with a US$6.5bn deal that was the talk of the US high-yield market. The deal is the second-largest bond offering on record and garnered US$11bn in orders.",9062013,http://www.reuters.com/article/verizon-acquisition-finance/refile-verizon-plans-record-breaking-bond-as-early-as-wednesday-idUSL6N0H22ET20130906
520,VZ,Verizon and regulators clash on internet rules,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. judges hearing a potential landmark case on U.S. regulation of internet traffic on Monday focused on whether certain charges levied on websites by internet service providers would be illegal moves to block the sites. The case revolves around a 2011 rule on so-called net neutrality. The rule requires internet providers treat all traffic equally and give consumers equal access to lawful content, even content that directly competes with the providers’ services. Verizon Communications Inc, the biggest U.S. wireless provider, has challenged the Federal Telecommunications Commission (FCC) rule. Verizon says clauses in the rule against blocking lawful content and giving all internet traffic equal treatment violate the company’s right to free speech and strip control of what its networks transmit and how. The decision on the case by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Colombia will have major implications on the debate over how much regulatory power the FCC should have over the Internet. “It is just not credible that Congress would have authorized these kinds of rules. We think that they (FCC) lack statutory authority,” attorney Helgi Walker, who argued for Verizon, told a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The panel on Monday seemed sympathetic to the idea the FCC had the authority to regulate some elements of how internet service providers give access to content. Two of the judges, however, seemed opposed to the part of the rule that calls for all traffic to receive equal treatment, said Harold Feld of the non-profit group Public Knowledge, who attended the hearing. “The court wanted to see this as Verizon’s right to cut a deal with big companies like Google. The whole reason that people adopt broadband is because there’s all that (other) stuff out there,” said Feld. The outcome of the case may determine whether internet service providers can restrict some content by, for instance, blocking or slowing down access to particular sites or charging websites to deliver their content faster. Judge Laurence Silberman repeatedly asked during the two-hour hearing if companies that provide internet service to consumers could charge websites for access to those consumers. Silberman questioned whether it was blocking for a service provider to refuse to carry a website if the website refused to pay the provider. “How else can you enforce this payment?” he asked. Judge David Tatel said he reads an aspect of the rules as saying that you can’t charge websites to merely exist online, but you can charge them for higher speed access. FCC General Counsel Sean Lev told the court: “No one is being told that they cannot charge.” Silberman raised Verizon’s argument that it had a First Amendment right to decide what websites its users had access to, using as an example access to a site with instructions on making chemical weapons. Tatel, in what could indicate a potential ruling, asked Verizon attorney Helgi Walker if the company could charge websites for higher speed or other priority access if the court struck down the rule’s so-called anti-discrimination clause calling for equal treatment of all traffic. Walker did not answer the question. She suggested, however, that if the court left the blocking clause standing but knocked down the anti-discrimination clause, Verizon would be happy with the result. “If all that was left standing is a no blocking (inaudible), then I don’t think we’d be here today,” Walker said. Tatel authored the 2010 court opinion that struck down the FCC’s earlier attempt to pursue a net neutrality case against Comcast Corp. The court said the agency lacked the authority to stop Comcast from blocking bandwidth-hogging applications. The court did not indicate when it would issue a ruling in the Verizon challenge. Verizon did not immediately respond to requests for comment after the hearing. MetroPCS, another wireless provider that stood alongside Verizon in the case, dropped its lawsuit earlier this year after being acquired by Deutsche Telecom AG’s T-Mobile USA. The FCC’s position in the Verizon case received a boost from the Supreme Court in May, when in a separate case it ruled in favor of giving regulatory agencies deference in interpreting the extent of their own regulatory authority. The case is Verizon v. FCC, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, case No. 11-1355 (and consolidated cases).

Talk is that the transaction has the potential to have 10 tranches, the sources said. “The announcement sounds like it could get accelerated to this afternoon,” said one investment grade syndicate manager away from the deal. “The world knows the trade is coming and meetings can still go on. They may as well get it out there and get investors involved.” Bankers at the bookrunners refused to comment. Syndicate desks were hearing the deal could include tranches of three-year fixed and floating rate securities, five-year fixed and floaters, as well as seven, 10, 20, 30, 50 and possibly even a 100 year portion. The deal is expected to come with significant new issue concession relative to outstandings. Talk last week was that the world’s biggest investors were indicating their willingness to participate in a 10-year bond which bookrunners were airing around Treasuries plus 200bp. One investor said he had heard the 10-year bonds to carry a spread of high 100s to 200bp.

531,VZ,Verizon bond demand causes CDS-bond distortion,"* CDS in Verizon undergoes decisive re-pricing * Verizon 5-year CDS spikes to 99.5bp intraday * Z-spread on 8.75% Nov 2018s increases to 192.5bp By Melissa Mott NEW YORK, Sept 11 (IFR) - The massive US$101bn demand for Verizon Communications’ US$49bn bond that priced on Wednesday caused an optical distortion in the company’s underlying CDS versus its cash bonds. The five-year CDS spiked to 99.5bp intraday from 71.5bp on August 28 - when chatter first evolved about Verizon Communications’ 45% stake purchase in Verizon Wireless. The Z-spread on its 8.75% November 2018s increased to 192.5bp today from 98bp on August 28. The CDS-cash basis between the five-year CDS and the 2018s touched its most negative point since December 2011 at minus-92.99bp, according to Thomson Reuters data. The Z-spread is commonly used to calculate the relationship between a credit’s CDS levels and its cash bonds - otherwise known as the basis. Riskier bonds usually have a large negative basis since there usually is an underlying concern about rapid credit deterioration. If this concern is coupled with significant widening, funding is perceived as more expensive. A larger negative basis is seen as compensation for an investor as it can generate the same returns as a more creditworthy name. “The magnitude of Verizon’s debt issuance leads us to believe that the distortion between the bond and CDS markets is likely to be due to technical factors,” said Fitch Solutions’ Diana Allmendinger. Prior to the buyout speculation, the CDS-cash basis was minus-26.55bp and was minus-57.64bp before chatter of the new bond deal appeared. Since the Verizon bonds priced on Wednesday, the CDS-cash basis has eased back to minus-87.28bp, the Z-spread is now 174.53bp and the 5-year CDS tightened to 87.25bp. CDS in Verizon underwent a decisive re-pricing to incorporate a growing fear of rating downgrade risk after it announced plans to issue a huge bond to fund the acquisition of the Verizon Wireless stake from Vodafone. Allmendinger said the recent move wider in its CDS is indicative of where the market prices Verizon, at BBB+.  And, the widening has combined with an increase in liquidity in Fitch’s CDS Pricing universe, which “indicates more uncertainty within the marketplace over future pricing.” Fitch’s implied rating, which reflects the historical CDS trading pattern, is steady at A. Meanwhile, Markit’s implied rating pegs the CDS a bit lower, at BBB. This CDS implied level is lower than where Moody’s or S&P; rating agencies grade Verizon’s long term debt rating - at Baa1 and BBB+. Moody’s, S&P; and Fitch all downgraded Verizon one notch on September 2 and 3, collectively. All the rating agencies cited the uptick in leverage and debt levels. Fitch cut the telecom to A-. This risk aversion and protection buying, was evidenced not only in the increasing spread, but also by net notional. DTCC data for the week ending September 2 shows a 6.58% spike in Verizon net positions to US$1.5bn and placing it among the top 20 biggest increases in net notional for the weekly period.",9112013,http://www.reuters.com/article/verizon-bond-derivatives/verizon-bond-demand-causes-cds-bond-distortion-idUSL2N0H72HQ20130911

Anxious to complete the entire bond portion of its  acquisition financing before a crucial Federal Open Market Committee meeting next week, Verizon decided to scrap $5 bilion-$10 billion of issuance in euros and sterling initially planned for next week do the entire amount in dollars. At $49 billion, the deal is bigger than the three previous record-sized deals combined: Apple’s $17 billion deal in April, AbbVie’s US14.7 billion last November and Roche Holdings’ $13.5 billion transaction in 2009. It is also larger than the GDP of some 90 countries. In addition, Verizon also now holds the record for the largest three-year, five-year, seven-year, 10-year, 20-year and 30-year fixed rate tranches, according to Thomson Reuters/SDC data. Sources with knowledge of the deal said Verizon and its key underwriters, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley, were shocked at the size of the order book that emerged by Tuesday afternoon. The total bond underwriting fees Verizon paid were also substantial, estimated at between $240-249 million by Thomson Reuters/Freeman Consulting. Some of the fee bonanza was also shared with several so-called passsive bookrunners, Citi, Credit Suisse, Mizuho, Royal Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Scotland and Wells Fargo. The $49 billion, along with about $12 billion of term loans, will completely refinance the $61 billion one-year bridge loan put in place last week to cover the debt portion of Verizon acquisition of Vodafone’s 45% holding in Verizon Wireless. Acquisition financing is often structured where banks will provide the acquirer with short-term loans to provide a bridge between making a bid on an asset and then putting permanent financing in place in the form of bonds and term loans. “Verizon had a preference to take out as much as they could, as quickly as they could, in maturities that were as long as possible,” said one source involved in the deal. “And once they signaled to the maket that they were out for size and were not going to play the usual game of pulling in the spread as orders came in the book, investors were willing to come into the deal in size.” More than 3000 orders worth more than $100 billion poured in from more than 1,200 investors as a result of new issue concessions greater than 50bp on the fixed rate tranches. This was in addition to the 50bp spread widening seen in the last fortnight on outstanding Verizon bonds, in anticipation of the new deal. Another source close to the deal said there was at least one order that exceeded $5 billion. Another source, not involved in the deal, said there was one order of $7 billion from one investor. “The investor base viewed this as an opportunity to get exposure to a name with the cash flow and debt reduction trajectory to return to a single A rating in a few years,” the source added. Verizon is rated Baa1/BBB+/A- by Moody’s, S&P; and Fitch. The bargain basement pricing was made obvious when the longer-dated tranches snapped in as much as 45bp as soon as they were free to trade. The three-year fixed rate tranche was trading 65bp tighter than its launch spread. “This deal has done very well but it was no secret the deal was priced very cheaply in order to accommodate the massive amount of size the company wanted to print,” said Frank Reda, head of trading at Taplin, Canida and Habacht. Tightening of 20bp is rarely seen in the investment grade market, let alone more than 40bp. Yet investors considered the deal to have been appropriately priced, given its size, and the bigger risk Verizon faced if it didn’t get all of its bond issued at once. “This amount of tightening is very uncommon but this amount of debt issuance is also very uncommon,” said Reda. “It was better for the company to pay a little extra and make sure that they complete all the funding they needed rather than risk the deal going poorly and them having to come back to market at a later date.” Verizon was left in no doubt by the bond underwriters that its spreads could widen out 40-50bp on the news of a $20 billion-plus transaction, as well as the fact that, given the volatile markets of late, that it might have to offer a further 50bp as new issue concession. It was not just the pricing that made the deal too good to refuse. Investors who benchmark themselves to bond indices were forced to take part simply because of the impact the size of the deal will have on the make up of indexes they measure their performance against. “With an offering of this magnitude, some portfolio managers who measure their performance against a benchmark might consider themselves as taking on a certain degree of basis risk by not participating in this deal,” said portfolio manager Bonnie Baha, who heads global developed credit at DoubleLine. Its average coupon on the tranches was 3.59%, and with the 10, 20 and 30-year coupons ranging from 5.15% to 6.55%, the deal even attracted junk bond investors. “Many people looked at the 5.2% expected coupon on the 10-year bond and realized that this is a blue-chip borrower that’s offering more than some double-B names,” said Mike Collins senior portfolio investment manager at Prudential.

538,VZ,Verizon's scrapped European bond disappoints investors,"* Investor hopes for large premium on euro/sterling bonds dashed * Euro telco bonds rally on postponement news * Bankers not involved relieved for league table reasons By Josie Cox LONDON, Sept 11 (IFR) - European investors were left disappointed by Verizon’s decision to scrap its euro and sterling bond issuance plans on Wednesday, having hoped the borrower would offer them juicy concessions comparable to those on the dollar notes. Bankers had originally said that euro and sterling bonds would account for about USD5-10bn equivalent of the USD49bn debt package, but after receiving more than USD100bn orders, from over 800 investors, Verizon opted to print just dollars, avoiding expensive currency swap costs. “I would have preferred to see euro and sterling tranches as I would likely have been able to secure more paper,” said Jens Vanbrabant a London-based portfolio manager at ECM Asset Management. “I am very disappointed,” another investor said. “Getting euros from Verizon would have been an excellent diversification buy and considering the spread on the dollar part it would likely have offered plenty of yield.” Speculation that the euro and sterling parts would be scrapped started brewing on Tuesday, when dollar books surpassed the USD50bn mark. But other euro telecom bonds rallied strongly when Verizon confirmed it was shelving a European deal. AT&T;’s existing 2.5% March 2023 bonds, for example, widened by 30bp - as investors pulled out to make room for Verizon paper. On the news that the European roadshow had been pulled, they snapped back by around 20bp. “It’s a shame as I’m sure dozens of major accounts would have been keen to buy - especially in sterling,” a third investor said. Year-to-date, less than GBP20bn of unsecured high grade corporate bonds have printed, down around 30% on last year’s like-for-like level. Some investors are sympathetic with Verizon’s decision to focus solely on the dollar market. “Verizon doesn’t really have euro or sterling requirements so in terms of the hedging and swap costs, doing it all in dollars seems like the sensible option,” Chris Higham, a fund manager at Aviva in London said. “If the deal had been smaller, Verizon may have been able to use different currencies to create some pricing tension and shave off some of the premium saving costs, but the sheer size of the deal meant that this would not have been possible in this case,” he said. Many traditional euro and sterling investors’ disappointment was also allayed by the fact that they were allocated at least some of the US dollar bonds - if not necessarily as much as they had wanted. “We participated in the US dollar issuance as most of our funds have a global mandate,” Tim Butcher, an Edinburgh-based fund manager at Scottish Widows said. “And we were pleased with the allocations and initial spread tightening.” This small group of investors, not disgruntled by the shelved transactions, was joined by several debt bankers not on the deal, who had been fearful a major euro bond would leave them disadvantaged in the bond league tables. “The fewer deals in euros away from us, the better for our league table position,” one syndicate official said.",9112013,http://www.reuters.com/article/verizon-bonds-europe/verizons-scrapped-european-bond-disappoints-investors-idUSL5N0H739120130911

545,VZ,Cheapened German Bunds lure back buyers,"* German 10-year yields retreat from 1-1/2-year highs * Investors cover short positions * Italian yields rise at auction * Italian debt continues to lag Spanish bonds By Emelia Sithole-Matarise and Ana Nicolaci da Costa LONDON, Sept 12 (Reuters) - German Bunds pushed higher on Thursday as investors bought back into a cheapened market after a slew of debt sales from higher-rated sovereign issuers. Bunds tracked U.S. Treasuries higher after a 10-year Treasury note sale drew strong demand the previous day and the completion of big corporate debt sales - including a record-breaking deal by Verizon Communications Inc. In the euro zone this week, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands sold a total of 11 billion euros ($15 billion) of bonds, which were smoothly absorbed. Comments by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi reiterating that the economic recovery in the euro zone was still “very, very green” and that short-term money market rates were unwarranted also underpinned demand for Bunds. German Bunds jumped 68 ticks to settle at 137.78 with traders saying some investors were also scrambling to cover positions after the market’s recent sharp selloff spurred by expectations the Federal Reserve would soon cut back its efforts to boost the economy by buying bonds. Cash 10-year German yields were down 5 basis points at 1.95 percent. They hit a 1-1/2 year high on Friday at 2.059 percent but have struggled to get much above 2 percent in recent sessions. “A lot of duration hit the market over the early part of the week and now that’s out of the way there’s a bit of consensus that the market can rally a little bit into the Federal Reserve meeting next week,” a trader said. “People are a little bit short the market so maybe the Bunds are ripe for a little bounce and that’s what we are seeing today.” In lower-rated bonds, Italian yields edged up as Rome paid more to raise funds at auction, highlighting investor concerns about a political crisis that some worry could stall efforts to revive the economy and contain debt levels. Italy sold the maximum planned amount of 7.5 billion euros and demand for its three-year bond was higher than at an auction of similar paper in July. But its cost of borrowing over three years was the highest in nearly a year, reflecting the political tensions. “In general, the auction was decent but not very strong given the cheapening of the Italian paper both versus the curve and versus other periphery (debt) like Spain,” said Annalisa Piazza, market economist at Newedge. “Market players are still sceptical on the political situation.” Italian 10-year yields were up 1.5 basis points at 4.54 percent, underperforming many euro zone counterparts including Germany and Spain. The premium offered by 10-year Italian bonds versus German  debt widened 8 basis points to 260 basis points. The Italian/Spanish equivalent rose as far as 7 basis points as Italian bonds continued to lag their Spanish counterparts. Italy’s underperformance also reflects concerns over the country’s economic outlook. Italian industrial output was much weaker than expected in July, data showed on Thursday, dousing hopes that the country might emerge from its longest post-war recession in the third quarter. The ECB warned of increasing risks surrounding Italy’s 2013 deficit target - a view the country’s welfare minister said was shared by the Italian government.",9122013,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-bonds/cheapened-german-bunds-lure-back-buyers-idUSL5N0H831B20130912

553,VZ,Verizon exec says tech firms 'grandstanding' over NSA -report,"NEW YORK, Sept 18 (Reuters) - A senior executive for Verizon Communications Inc has accused U.S. technology companies of “grandstanding” in public comments about their forced cooperation with U.S. spy agencies, according to a report by technology news website ZDNet.com. Verizon declined to comment on the report, which was published on Tuesday. ZDNet cited comments made by John Stratton, the head of Verizon’s enterprise business, during a business trip to Tokyo. Companies including Google Inc, Microsoft Corp  and Yahoo Inc have been pushing for authority to disclose more about their dealings with the U.S. National Security Agency after former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed sweeping domestic classified surveillance operations earlier this year. According to ZDNet, Stratton said he appreciates that it is important for the technology firms to “grandstand a bit, and wave their arms and protest loudly so as not to offend the sensibility of their customers.” But Stratton suggested that national security was more important than other concerns, according to the report. LinkedIn Corp, the social networking site for professionals, on Tuesday joined other Silicon Valley companies, which have asked the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to grant permission to publish aggregate data about national-security requests, including those made through FISA court orders. () Among the documents leaked by Snowden are some showing that the NSA obtained massive quantities of data about phone calls placed over Verizon’s network. Stratton said his company is obliged to cooperate with the laws in countries where it operates, according to ZDNet. “There is another question that needs to be kept in the balance, which is a question of civil liberty and the rights of the individual citizen in the context of that broader set of protections that the government seeks to create in its society,” he said.

The decision by the big U.S. wireless operators helped lift shares of BCE Inc, Rogers Communications Inc, and Telus Corp, which together control about 90 percent of the Canadian mobile market. The three stocks had already rallied earlier this month when Verizon disclosed it would not enter Canada for now, ending months of speculation that it would buy two small Canadian operators and bid for airwaves in the January 2014 auction. The entry of a foreign giant like Verizon would have sliced into the profits of the Canadian players and forced higher bids at the spectrum auction, analysts said. AT&T; Inc declined to comment on whether it had submitted an application by the Canadian government’s Tuesday deadline for companies to register for the auction. But Scotia Capital telecom analyst Jeff Fan said in a note to clients that all four major U.S. wireless operators had confirmed they wouldn’t be bidding. The companies decided not to enter due to a likely unattractive return on investment, regulatory risks on both sides of the border, and a focus on the much larger U.S. market, Fan wrote in the note published late on Wednesday. Shares in Telus jumped more than 2 percent by midafternoon on the Toronto Stock Exchange, while Rogers gained 1.2 percent and Bell was up 0.3 percent in a declining market. The Canadian government will publish a list of bidders for the 700 megahertz spectrum next Monday, following Tuesday’s deadline to submit an application and a relatively cheap and refundable deposit. The 700 MHz airwaves are highly valued for their ability to penetrate buildings and travel long distances, and are being used in the United States to build high-speed networks. Ottawa is hoping to spark more competition in the wireless industry via the auction, by blocking Bell, Telus and Rogers from bidding on more than one prime frequency block in each region. Telus Corp said on Tuesday it plans to bid in the auction, while BCE Inc’s chief executive told an investor conference earlier this month that the company would be bidding. Rogers declined to comment ahead of the official release of applicants. Well-funded challengers could still emerge, with private equity groups seen as the most likely consolidators of the three, closely-held small operators that entered the industry after a 2008 wireless spectrum auction: Wind Mobile, Mobilicity and Public Mobile. “Recent private equity investments have been made in Public Mobile and Mobilicity, while Accelero remains an interested bidder for the Wind assets,” said Macquarie analyst Greg MacDonald. “We have also heard that larger telco-focused private equity firms have remained interested in the event that Verizon does not invest.” Wind Mobile, an upstart challenger backed by Europe-focused Vimpelcom Ltd, said late on Monday that it intends to participate in the auction. Telenor ASA, a large minority shareholder in Vimpelcom, had no comment on whether it would bid. A source with knowledge of the company’s plans says they are not interested. Mobilicity, which is struggling to find a buyer and is bleeding cash, has not said whether it will bid. Privately-held Public Mobile declined to comment. Privately-held cable company Eastlink, which also bought airwaves in 2008 but didn’t launch service in its Maritimes footprint until this year, declined to comment on a Cartt.ca report it will bid. Regional operator Manitoba Telecom Services Inc said earlier this month it does not plan to bid outside of its home province. Quebec-focused Quebecor did not respond to requests for comment.

555,VZ,"No big foreign telecoms in Canada auction, boosting domestics","OTTAWA (Reuters) - Major foreign telecommunications companies have decided against registering for a Canadian wireless spectrum auction, in a setback for the government’s plans to introduce more competition into the mobile telephone sector. The lack of big foreign entrants in a list of bidders that the government published on Monday is good news for the dominant Canadian companies - Rogers Communications Inc, BCE Inc and Telus Corp. Shares of Rogers, BCE and Telus rose in morning trading. All three stocks had taken a beating in June on reports that Verizon Communications Inc was looking to enter the Canadian telecommunications market. Verizon later said it would not do so. In all, 15 companies registered to bid on the 700 MHz spectrum in an auction that kicks off on January 14. The process may last two to seven weeks, based on how long similar auctions have taken internationally. “We view the list as a key positive for the incumbents and a key disappointment for the government, which wants four carriers in every market,” Dvai Ghose, head of research at Canaccord Genuity in Toronto, said in a research note. The Conservative government has tried to ensure a strong fourth player could challenge the incumbents in each region of Canada, and it eliminated foreign ownership restrictions on small companies to try to attract competition. There are smaller fourth players in some parts of the country. “Surely now the government realizes that the market will not support four carriers per market and must rethink its failed wireless policy,” Ghose said. But Industry Minister James Moore did not concede defeat, saying the government’s efforts to increase competition among telecoms had already led to lower prices. “This trend will continue as a result of January’s auction,” he said in a statement. “In addition to this auction, our government will continue to aggressively pursue policies that ensure consumer interests are at the core of all government decisions.” He did not specify what other policies he might pursue, but if all else fails, the government has the option of trying to drive prices down through regulation. Moore last week endorsed the decision by the government regulator to study roaming rates. RBC Dominion Securities analyst Drew McReynolds cautioned against chasing Canadian telecoms stocks despite the lack of new foreign bidders, saying “regulatory risk is now the major headwind for incumbents.” There remains the outside chance that a big foreign wireless player could try to buy one of the small Canadian outfits and bid on spectrum using the Canadian operator’s initial registration for the auction. But McReynolds cautioned it would be “a still tough up-hill climb for any 4th player in Canada regardless of size or access to capital.” Among the auction registrants is a unit of Canadian private equity firm Birch Hill Equity Partners Management Inc, which was tipped earlier as a possible bidder for small companies Wind Mobile and Mobilicity. Sources familiar with Birch Hill’s plans said in August that the company had sought financial backing from Rogers in a plan that involved Wind Mobile’s sharing its network with the market leader. It was not clear if this was still the plan and, if so, whether the government would allow it. Mobilicity Chairman John Bitove is listed as a bidder through a company called Feenix Wireless Inc. Separately, private equity firm Catalyst Capital Group Inc, which owns Mobilicity debt, also signed up. Both Wind Mobile and Mobilicity launched their wireless services after acquiring spectrum in 2008 and have struggled to break the incumbents’ grip. Wind, however, has attracted 650,000 wireless customers, compared with 7 million to 10 million each for the Big Three. With no Verizons or AT&Ts; in the mix and what he termed muted private equity interest, Ghose said the government might raise less revenue from the auction than it had hoped. He estimated the cost for each of the four prime blocks at well below the C$500 million ($485 million) he had initially assumed. Interest from a big foreign carrier like Verizon would have brought the price per block to about $1 billion, he said. The information provided on Monday did not reveal companies’ bidding strategies, such as the regions where they plan to bid. There are 14 regions, with seven spectrum blocks in each. But four of those blocks are most coveted because they are aligned with U.S. airwaves. The registered companies can withdraw from the auction and get a full refund on their deposits. The government will publish the final list of provisionally qualified bidders on October 23. BCE shares climbed 1.3 percent by late afternoon on the Toronto Stock Exchange to C$44.50 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Rogers was up 1.4 percent at C$45.47, and Telus rose 2.5 percent to C$35.44.

557,VZ,"DEALS-M&A; flat so far this year, even with mammoth Verizon deal","* M&A; activity up 0.8 pct in first 9 months of 2013 * Goldman Sachs top adviser worldwide so far in 2013 * U.S. M&A; up 35 pct, Europe down 24 pct, Asia dropped 8 pct By Michael Erman and Soyoung Kim NEW YORK, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Dealmaking around the world was basically flat over the first nine months of the year, a disappointing level given the $130 billion Verizon Communications Inc transaction that bolstered mergers and acquisition volumes in the third quarter. With ongoing uncertainty about economic recoveries around the globe, the specter of rising interest rates as well as increasingly activist investors clamoring for a return of capital to shareholders, top investment bankers and lawyers do not expect a significant pickup in deal activity soon. “Between increased rates, and, at times, unpredictable deal-approval regulatory framework, and continued debt ceiling issues, we’re back in the annual dance of uncertainty,” said Paul Parker, head of global corporate finance and M&A; at Barclays. “The silver lining is that the Fed has made it clear that they’re not going to pull back on easing near-term. And therefore, companies probably do have a window to take advantage of the rate environment which is still historically low,” he said. Some companies have been taking advantage of cheap financing to make cash bids. Verizon’s mammoth deal to buy Vodafone Group  out of its U.S. wireless business, history’s third largest corporate deal announcement, illustrates this trend. The conventional wisdom that the U.S. Federal Reserve might taper its bond buying, which would have resulted in higher interest rates, could have spurred some companies to do some of these deals before the Fed’s September meeting. “The prospect of a taper seemed to crystallize for some buyers the impact higher rates would have on the economics of cash transactions,” said Anthony Whittemore, co-head of mergers & acquisitions for the Americas at Deutsche Bank. Ironically, he said the possibility that the Fed may wait months until a taper could lull some companies back into inactivity. “The Fed’s decision to defer may have taken some of the pressure off as buyers anticipate a longer period for the current interest rate environment,” Whittemore said. Through Sept. 24, global deal volume rose 0.8 percent to $1.67 trillion so far this year, up from $1.66 trillion a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters data. Excluding the Verizon-Vodafone deal, global deal volume fell 7 percent to $1.54 trillion. The total number of deals so far this year has fallen 9.6 percent to 25,374. “Boards and CEOs don’t have great confidence in the economy right now, they don’t have confidence that we have a strong recovery going on and that it’s going to sustain itself,” said Scott Barshay, head of corporate department at law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP. Goldman Sachs Group Inc was the top M&A; adviser worldwide, with $509.7 billion worth of deals over the period. JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Merrill Lynch , Morgan Stanley, and Barclays rounded out the top five. Deals in the Americas rose 18 percent to $910.9 billion, and accounted for 54 percent of global dealmaking in 2013. The United States performed particularly well, rising 35 percent year over year, and the region would have seen a double digit increase over the period even excluding the Verizon-Vodafone deal. “The M&A; story is a little bit of a regional story where activity is up disproportionately in the Americas, compared to Europe and Asia Pacific,” said Patrick Ramsey, co-head of Americas M&A; at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “The big difference is that the recovery here began earlier and is on firmer footing than Europe overall.” Mergers and acquisitions fell 24 percent in Europe to $383.3 billion, although dealmakers say that for the first time in a long time, clients in the region area showing a rebound in sentiment. For instance, in addition to the Verizon deal, Vodafone struck 7.7 billion euro deal to buy Kabel Deutschland , and French ad agency Publicis $35 billion merger with U.S. agency Omnicom. “All things seem to point to a future increase of M&A; activity,” said Gilberto Pozzi, head of M&A;, for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Goldman Sachs. “The conditions for healthy M&A; are there, if people decide to act on them is another question, but certainly in terms of dialogues we’re having they’re as good as they’ve been in the recent past,” Pozzi said. Deals in the Asia-Pacific region dipped 8 percent to $269 billion. An additional headwind facing many companies considering large or complex deals is the prevalence of activist investors. Dealmakers said they have recently spent more of their time discussing activism and its defense with clients. Worries about how shareholders might react to deals have delayed timing or scuttled deals that would have been consummated previously, they said. Indeed, in the United States, Michael Dell’s $25 billion offer to take Dell Inc private as well as the $4.7 billion offer for Smithfield Foods Inc by China’s Shuanghui International were challenged by activists after they were announced. “Directors today, in general, are doing an excellent job in their oversight role, whereas 15-25 years ago there was much more rubber stamping going on. The result of that though is that management teams can be hesitant to bring deals to boards of directors, unless they’re perfect or near perfect,” said Cravath’s Barshay. U.S. regulators are also complicating deals. The U.S. Justice Department sued to block American Airlines  and US Airways’ proposed merger in August after squeezing concessions out of AB Inbev in its deal for Modelo earlier this year, and a U.S. court halted Vivendi SA’s  $8.2 billion deal to sell most of its stake in Activision Blizzard Inc back to the videogame publisher earlier this month. “We’re seeing more activism out of the antitrust regulators and as a result, fewer deals are being pursued because of fear that the regulators will just turn them down or demand too high a price,” Barshay said. There were some bright spots: real estate and health care deals rose 42 percent and 30 percent from last year, respectively. Private equity-backed deals were up 16 percent year over year with $238.2 billion of transactions, including Berkshire Hathaway Inc and 3G Capital Partners’ $27 billion takeover of HJ Heinz Co. And deals over $5 billion rose 16 percent to $498.7 billion. Bank of America’s Ramsey said he believes the increase in the largest deals foretells a pickup in coming quarters for M&A; activity in general. “Overall deal activity is a good barometer of CEO and board confidence, but big deal activity — $10 billion and plus — is the best barometer of CEO and board confidence, and we’ve seen more big deal announcements this year, year to date, than any year since 2008, prior to the onset of the financial crisis,” he said.",9262013,http://www.reuters.com/article/deals-q3/deals-ma-flat-so-far-this-year-even-with-mammoth-verizon-deal-idUSL2N0HL2E920130926

560,VZ,"UPDATE 1-Telecom tycoon says Ottawa's policy imperils Wind, foreign investment","By Alastair Sharp and Euan Rocha TORONTO, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Lack of clarity around Ottawa’s telecommunications policy has jeopardized foreign investment in Canada and cast doubt over the future of Wind, the largest new player in the Canadian wireless market, said Egyptian telecom magnate Naguib Sawiris on Wednesday. Sawiris bankrolled the start-up of new telecom player Wind Mobile in 2008, but he lost his ties with the company after his controlling stake in Orascom was sold to European telecoms firm  Vimpelcom Ltd in 2011. He retained an interest in investing in the Canadian telecom sector until earlier this month, when the Canadian government blocked his bid to buy Manitoba Telecom Services Inc’s  Allstream fiber optic network, citing unspecified national security concerns. “Canada is behaving like a third-world country. It is not behaving like a Western developed economy,” Sawiris said in an interview with Reuters on Wednesday. Sawiris, whose investment firm Accelero Capital Holdings had offered C$520 million ($500 million) for the Allstream unit, said he was livid about the Allstream ruling and he vowed not to invest any further funds in Canada. A spokeswoman for the Canadian government, responding to the comments, said Canada “is open to foreign investment in all sectors of the economy, but not at the expense of the security of Canadians.” Investors have become much more wary about Canada’s foreign investment rules after Ottawa blocked a handful of high-profile deals, including the 2010 attempt by BHP Billiton to acquire fertilizer giant Potash Corp. Last year, Ottawa allowed a Chinese firm to buy domestic energy company Nexen, but made clear it would block further investments in oil sands by foreign state-owned enterprises. Sawiris said he now plans to redirect his investment focus toward other markets, including Italy where he has invested heavily in the past. He plans to invest as much as $1 billion in a range of industries in Egypt over the next 18 months. “We are looking at other markets. We will look in Italy, we will look everywhere, but I will definitely not be wasting any more time on Canada,” he said. “I will not waste another minute, or another penny on Canada.” Sawiris said he believes the lack of certainty around who can pour money into the Canadian telecom sector puts Wind at risk of going “belly up.” Asked about the health of the company, a spokesman for Wind said by email: “We can’t comment on Mr. Sawiris’ statement as it is his personal opinion and he is no longer connected to Wind Mobile Canada.” Sawiris’ scathing remarks come just as Canada has launched a crucial auction of airwaves, which has failed to draw interest from any major foreign telecoms. Sawiris said Ottawa’s opaque policy has scared away many investors. He also argued that Wind would be hamstrung in the 700 megahertz spectrum auction and would struggle to survive in the long term. A Wind spokesman downplayed these concerns saying, “The decision to participate in the 700MHz auction will be decided by the current shareholders of Wind Canada — Vimpelcom and AAL.” AAL is the holding company of Wind CEO Anthony Lacavera, who holds a majority of voting shares but a minority stake in Wind. A spokesman for Vimpelcom declined to comment. Canada’s Conservative government initially cheered for the success of Wind. But Ottawa dragged its feet on approving a change-of-control request from Vimpelcom, whose top investor is Moscow-based Altimo, controlled by billionaire Mikhail Fridman. Vimpelcom, which has hired UBS to assess a possible sale of Wind. In June it withdrew its request for a change in control that would have given it voting power equal to its equity stake, when it appeared that U.S. telecom giant Verizon Communications Inc was keen to strike a deal and acquire Wind. However, Verizon’s interest has cooled, and while Wind is bidding in the spectrum auction it is unclear the extent to which Vimpelcom and its other backers will be willing to fund its bids - given doubts around whether they can eventually sell the business and who may be allowed to acquire it. Wind is the fourth-largest telecoms player in Canada, but both it and other new entrants have struggled to turn a profit. Last month, Mobilicity, one of the smallest players in Canada, filed for creditor protection. Ottawa has loosened foreign ownership rules in the sector and startups appear keen to sell out to larger players. But Ottawa’s ruling on Allstream appears to show that only a small pool of foreign bidders may be allowed to invest in the sector. The government has also indicated it does not want the big domestic players, BCE Inc, Telus Corp and Rogers Communications Inc, to acquire the startups. In June, Canada rejected the transfer of Mobilicity’s wireless spectrum licenses to Telus, stating that it would not approve deals that led to undue spectrum concentration. “Canada’s not serious about having foreign direct investment and they are not serious about opening their telecom market,” Sawiris said. “It’s a waste of time, and investors like us we don’t have time to pay lawyers and accounting firms and do due diligence and block our capital for six, eight months.” ",10162013,http://www.reuters.com/article/canada-telecoms-sawiris/update-1-telecom-tycoon-says-ottawas-policy-imperils-wind-foreign-investment-idUSL1N0I61Q920131016

In June, Canada rejected the transfer of Mobilicity’s wireless spectrum licenses to Telus, stating that it would not approve deals that led to undue spectrum concentration. “Canada’s not serious about having foreign direct investment and they are not serious about opening their telecom market,” Sawiris said. “It’s a waste of time, and investors like us we don’t have time to pay lawyers and accounting firms and do due diligence and block our capital for six, eight months.” ",10162013,http://www.reuters.com/article/canada-telecoms-sawiris/egyptian-tycoon-says-wind-mobile-in-peril-due-to-ottawa-policy-idUSL1N0I614G20131016

The S&P; 500’s intraday record of 1732.92 broke the all-time high set Sept. 19. Over 80 percent of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange rose. Technology was the only S&P; sector to show a loss as IBM led the decline. IBM shares hit a two-year low a day after reporting weaker-than-expected revenue and subtracted 76 points from the Dow industrial average. IBM also was the biggest decliner on the S&P; 500, ending down 6.4 percent at $174.78. Earnings released after the market’s close by Google  boosted shares of the world’s No. 1 Web search engine  6.9 percent to $950.94 in extended-hours trading. Google said consolidated revenue increased 12 percent to $14.89 billion even as losses deepened at its Motorola mobile phone business. [ID: nL1N0162E7] Congress approved an 11th-hour deal on Wednesday to end a partial government shutdown and increase U.S. borrowing authority, pulling the United States back from a possible default on its debt. The political wrangling has led some investors to believe the U.S. Federal Reserve will have no choice but to leave its fiscal stimulus measures in place for several more months. That could keep stocks rising through the rest of the year. “The scare that was created by the lengthy delay in resolving the (fiscal) issue has created a situation that has taken Fed tapering off the table for a considerable period here,” said Stephen Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Equity Management in San Francisco. “That is why we saw buying over the last week and that is why we will see continued buying for a few more days.” The CBOE Volatility Index, a measure of investor anxiety, fell to 13.43, the lowest since Sept. 20, the week before the government shutdown began. Investors had worried that an extended shutdown would weigh on economic growth and corporate outlooks. A Reuters survey showed economists have grown less optimistic about prospects for the economy as the fight over fiscal policy took its toll. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 3.98 points, or 0.03 percent, at 15,369.85. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 11.36 points, or 0.66 percent, at 1,732.90. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 23.72 points, or 0.62 percent, at 3,863.15. Trading volume was relatively light at 5.3 billion total shares. Goldman Sachs shares fell 2.4 percent to $158.32 after the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets said third-quarter revenue plunged 20 percent, hurt by weak mortgage and bond-trading results. So far, 54.4 percent of companies in the S&P; 500 have beaten  Wall Street revenue estimates, down from the 61 percent average since 2002 but above the 49 percent average for the past four quarters. EBay Inc dropped 3.9 percent to $51.38 and was the biggest drag on the Nasdaq 100 index after the company gave a disappointing holiday forecast a day earlier, saying the U.S. economy had deteriorated partly because of the government shutdown. Among gainers, shares of Verizon Communications Inc, the largest U.S. mobile operator, rose 3.5 percent to $48.90 after the company posted stronger-than-expected third-quarter earnings and revenue. Chipotle Mexican Grill reported a 15 percent jump in quarterly profit after the closing bell. Chipotle shares were up 7.1 percent to $470.00 in extended-hours trading. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped from a six-month high last week but remained elevated as California continued to deal with a backlog related to computer problems.

565,VZ,"Verizon third-quarter earnings, revenue beat Wall Street estimates","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc on Thursday posted stronger- than-expected third-quarter earnings and revenue driven by wireless growth, sending its shares up 4 percent. While wireless customer growth was slightly below Wall Street estimates, its Verizon Wireless venture with Vodafone Group Plc posted good profit and revenue growth as customers spent more on data services. Verizon has agreed to buy out Vodafone’s 45 percent share of the venture. The subscriber shortfall caused some concern that the company, the first U.S. telephone operator to report this quarter, was losing market share to rivals such as T-Mobile US Inc. New Street analyst Jonathan Chaplin said that while Verizon’s financials were “outstanding,” “there were clear signs that a resurgent TMUS is impacting even Verizon.” Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo conceded some lower-spending customers moved to rival services in the quarter even as he told analysts on the company’s quarterly conference call that “we continue to gain market share.” Instead, he blamed the subscriber shortfall on shortage of Apple Inc’s iPhone 5S. About one-half of the Verizon Wireless smartphone activations were iPhones, representing roughly 3.9 million iPhone activations. “The shortage on the 5S was a significant issue for the quarter,” Shammo told Reuters in an interview. The executive said that 8.4 percent service revenue growth at Verizon Wireless was sustainable in the short term but expected the growth rate to decline in the future. Verizon Wireless added 927,000 net retail subscribers in the quarter, compared with Wall Street expectations of about 1 million customers, according to eight analysts, with estimates ranging from 900,000 to 1.2 million. While much of Verizon’s growth was from customers connecting devices like tablet computers, Verizon said phone customers, still made up the most of its growth at 481,000. Verizon said it expects wireless customer growth to improve sequentially in the fourth quarter but did not give specific estimates. Verizon reported a third-quarter profit of $2.2 billion, or 78 cents per share, compared with $1.59 billion, or 56 cents per share, a year ago. Excluding unusual items, Verizon earned 77 cents per share in the quarter, compared with Wall Street expectations of 74 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Its wireless profit margin was 51.1 percent, based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization(EBITDA) as a percentage of service revenue, and above its target range of 49 percent to 50 percent for the full year. Hudson Square analyst Rethemeier said the profit margin would likely come down in the fourth quarter due to steep holiday season costs, since the company kept its wireless margin target for the year despite the strong third-quarter number. Revenue rose 4.4 to $30.28 billion from $29.01 billion. Wall Street expected $30.16 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Strong wireless service revenue growth for the quarter was offset by a decline of 3 percent in its global enterprise business and a slower 4.3 percent rise in its consumer business, which includes its FiOS television service. Verizon’s enterprise business was affected by government budget cutbacks and cost cuts in the private sector, according to Shammo, who expects the business to remain flat in 2014. “Generally speaking, enterprise customers continue to be cautious regarding new investment decisions,” Shammo said. Verizon, which competes with cable companies in television and broadband services, said it added 173,000 net FiOS Internet connections and 135,000 net FiOS video customers in the quarter. Shammo said Verizon terminated a technology joint venture with cable rivals Comcast Corp, Time Warner Cable and privately held Brighthouse Networks for competitive reasons. The venture, which had worried some consumer advocates, was set up to develop converged wireless and wireline products for consumers when Verizon agreed to buy wireless spectrum for its cable rivals. The cable operators still resell Verizon Wireless services in markets where they do not compete but Shammo said that the technology venture was killed because of competition concerns. “What was realized was that the cable companies didn’t want to jointly develop something that FiOS was going to get at the end of the day and of course we weren’t doing to jointly develop something that FiOS wouldn’t get,” Shammo said. “There was no meetings of the minds.” Verizon shares rose 3.9 percent to $49.14 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

The S&P; 500 reached 1729.64, just under its record intraday high of 1729.86 on Sept. 18. The CBOE Volatility Index, a measure of investor anxiety, fell to 13.60, its lowest since Sept. 26, the week before the government shutdown began. Congress on Wednesday approved an 11th-hour deal to end a partial government shutdown and pull the world’s biggest economy back from the edge of default. “This has been a market with a ‘buy the dip’ mentality. If investors are convinced money is going to flow into the market for whatever reason, they may not want to miss that run up,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist for Prudential Financial in Newark. The Dow, however, fell, pulled down by International Business Machines Corp’s shares. That stock hit a two-year low a day after reporting weaker-than-expected revenue, and accounted for 78 points off the Dow Jones industrial average. IBM was the biggest decliner on the S&P; 500, trading down 6.8 percent to $174.04. The political wrangling has led some investors to believe the U.S. Federal Reserve will have no choice but to leave its fiscal stimulus measures in place for several more months. This could bolster stocks in coming months. “We never really had a chance to have a nice rally off the Fed’s lack of tapering because when we got the news back in September everyone started worrying about the budget situation,” said Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer for multi-asset strategies for ING Investment Management.

Congress on Wednesday approved an 11th-hour deal to end a partial government shutdown and pull the world’s biggest economy back from the edge of default that could have brought about financial calamity. “Today we are in a sigh of relief that we have averted the crisis, but longer term we haven’t solved the problem,” said Ron Florance, deputy chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank in Scottsdale, Arizona. “Earnings are going to reflect the damage that was done, and if not the earnings, definitely the forward guidance.” The Dow was dragged lower by International Business Machines Corp’s shares hitting a two-year low a day after reporting a 4 percent drop in third-quarter revenue, weaker than expected. The tech bellwether was also the worst performing stock on the S&P; 500, trading down 6 percent to $175.58.

The market took a pause after a jump of more than 1 percent on Wall Street Wednesday, after senators came to agreement to reopen the government through Jan. 15 and raise the debt ceiling until Feb. 7. “Much of the good news that had relieved market stress over lifting the debt ceiling was baked into a violent rally in the prior session lifting the benchmark S&P; 500 index to within spitting distance of another all-time high” on Wednesday, said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak & Co in New York. Data released early Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped from a six-month high last week, but remained elevated as California continued to deal with a backlog related to computer problems. The report barely moved the market. In another day of heavy earnings, Goldman Sachs  shares fell 2.1 percent in premarket trading after the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets said its quarterly profit fell as weak bond-trading volumes hurt revenue. Verizon Communications Inc posted stronger-than expected third-quarter earnings and revenue, sending its shares up 3 percent in premarket trading. China’s Dagong Global Credit Rating said the temporary fix of the U.S. debt issue would not defuse the fundamental conundrum of the massive U.S. fiscal deficit or improve repayment ability in the long term, but could trigger defaults at any time in the future. “Within 20-minutes of an overnight ratings downgrade for U.S. sovereign debt, stock index futures reached session lows dragged down by a slide in the dollar,” Wilkinson said. S&P; 500 futures fell 2 points and were slightly below fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract.

571,VZ,UPDATE 2-Sprint promises higher data speeds than rivals,"By Edwin Chan and Sinead Carew BURLINGAME, Calif., Oct 30 (Reuters) - Sprint Corp  promised to gradually offer wireless data speeds far in excess of those offered by bigger rivals like Verizon, as it hopes to use recently acquired wireless airwaves to regain market share. At its research labs on the outskirts of San Francisco, Sprint on Wednesday outlined plans to expand Spark, a service it is now building with speeds of 50-60 megabits per second, which is being rolled out initially in five cities: Los Angeles, Tampa, Miami, Chicago and New York. In comparison, Verizon Wireless  says it provides customers data speeds of 5-12 megabits per second but its high-speed network covers 303 million people. After losing subscribers for years, No. 3 U.S. mobile service provider Sprint is looking to distinguish itself from rivals AT&T; Inc, Verizon Wireless and T-Mobile US , which are ahead of it in high-speed upgrades. “Sprint has a much broader set of spectrum in more markets than their competitors,” said Andy Castonguay, principal analyst at  Machina Research. “Their spectrum holdings give them a unique advantage.” But he cautioned a lot of Sprint’s plans seemed theoretical for the moment and the industry has to see the technology in action to understand the impact on the consumer. With rapidly increasing bandwidth, other issues such as power consumption, battery life and heat will come to the fore. “It’s going to push the boundaries of power consumption and antenna design. It’s going to be very interesting to watch the next generation of devices,” he said. Sprint demonstrated to reporters at its Burlingame labs ultra-fast wireless data speeds of 1 gigabits per second, about 16 times faster than its current peak speeds and rivaling the fastest wireline speeds. It also showed off potential applications of ultra high-speed wireless, from online multiplayer gaming to simultaneous streams of video based on next-generation “4K” TV technology. AT&T; shrugged off Sprint’s claims but declined to comment on its own speeds. “A demo counts as much as making a touchdown with no other players on the field,” AT&T; spokesman Mark Siegel said. Sprint has tried to win back customers through initiatives such as plans that offer unlimited data for life. On Wednesday it posted a decline in third-quarter revenue after losing more subscribers than expected following the shutdown of its older network. Investors have been anxious to see what Sprint, which is 80 percent-owned by Japan’s SoftBank Corp, would do with its partner’s financial backing and the experience of Softbank founder Masayoshi Son, who was able to quickly turn around his own company’s mobile business. They are also anxious to hear how much network upgrades would cost. The company said it would provide capital spending details when it reports fourth-quarter results. Sprint’s plans include antennas that use 8 transmitters and receivers versus the current 2-plus, devices capable of handling tri-band frequencies and employing its spectrum range to achieve peak speeds of up to 150 to 180 mbps by late 2015. Softbank has expertise in this area that will come in handy, Sprint CEO Dan Hesse told reporters in Burlingame. And it plans to use the latest technology and airwaves from its buyout of Clearwire Corp to boost its network capacity. “We paid a lot of money for Clearwire and that spectrum.  We did it because the 800 frequencies were so valuable that if you could put it all together ..., the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.” The company said it plans to deploy Sprint Spark in about 100 of America’s largest cities during the next three years. Sprint expects 100 million people in the United States will have Sprint Spark by the end of 2014. It said that its high-speed service based on Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology will be available to about 250 million people by mid-2014, compared with its 200 million target for the end of 2013. Sprint said the first devices that work on both its own existing spectrum and Clearwire’s spectrum will go on sale in early November from HTC Corp, LG Electronics  and Samsung Electronics. Alcatel Lucent and Nokia said they are helping Sprint with its network upgrade. Sprint shares closed up 25 cents or almost 4 percent at $6.93 on the New York Stock Exchange after the news.",10302013,http://www.reuters.com/article/sprint-speed/update-2-sprint-promises-higher-data-speeds-than-rivals-idUSL1N0IK1QY20131030

That product competes with Netflix. Intel has struggled to reach content deals with media companies even though it offered to pay sizeable premiums over traditional cable rates. Doubts about Intel’s commitment to the venture emerged in June after newly appointed Chief Executive Brian Krzanich warned he was taking a cautious approach to television, which is far from the company’s core business of chip manufacturing.

Apple Inc, Google Inc, Sony Corp  and Microsoft Corp  are jockeying for position to own the living room through TV, while Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc’s  streaming video services have millions of subscribers. Verizon already has a streaming product as part of a joint venture with Redbox, which focuses mostly on streaming movies and not on TV shows, according to its website. That product competes with Netflix. Intel has struggled to reach content deals with media companies even though it offered to pay sizeable premiums over traditional cable rates. Doubts about Intel’s commitment to the venture emerged in June after newly appointed Chief Executive Brian Krzanich warned he was taking a cautious approach to television, which is far from the company’s core business of chip manufacturing.",10302013,http://www.reuters.com/article/intel-verizon/update-1-intel-looking-to-exit-tv-project-in-talks-with-verizon-idUSL1N0IK1AR20131030

It was the second outage in three days. The data hub operator, Verizon, said it was doing maintenance on the system. “Access Health CT was informed by CMS (Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services) that the Federal Data Services Hub is currently experiencing an outage,” a statement from the Connecticut state exchange said. A similar outage on Sunday halted online enrollment on the federal Healthcare.gov website as well as similar state sites. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HSS) declined comment on the development, and referred calls to Verizon. Verizon’s Terremark operates the data services hub that links online health insurance marketplaces with numerous federal agencies and can verify people’s identity, citizenship, and other facts. “We are now undertaking infrastructure maintenance, which should be complete overnight. We anticipate the strengthened infrastructure will help eliminate application downtimes,” said a statement by Jeff Nelson, vice president of global corporate communications at Verizon Enterprise Solutions. He said the maintenance had been undertaken at the request of an HHS official, but did not name the person. “Verizon is committed to supporting our HHS client and stabilizing their www.healthcare.gov website. Since HHS asked us to provide additional compute and storage capacity, our engineers have worked 24/7 to trouble-shoot issues with the site,” the statement said.

It was the first time the high-profile issue has come before the justices since former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden began in June to leak secret documents detailing American surveillance programs.

Activists including Trillium Asset Management of Boston and the $161 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund have filed proposals for the spring shareholder meetings of AT&T; and Verizon, representatives said. Both resolutions call on the companies to report semi-annually on “metrics and discussion regarding requests for customer information by U.S. and foreign governments.” As carriers of massive amounts of voice and data traffic, the telecommunications companies have been at the center of controversies over the use of their data by U.S. intelligence agencies. Just on Monday the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge to a ruling that gave the government access to Verizon records of millions of telephone calls. A worry is the close ties could hurt the companies’ business, said Trillium Senior Vice President Jonas Kron. “From an investor perspective, this is one of those issues where there’s an overlap of interests” among privacy advocates and business groups, Kron said. He cited surveys that spying fears could cut tens of billions of dollars from the sales of cloud computing services. New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, sole trustee of the state retirement fund, the prime sponsor of the resolution at AT&T;, said “Customer trust is critical for any business, but nowhere is it more so than for those corporations that handle our personal data and communications.” AT&T; spokesman Mark Siegel said that “As standard practice we look carefully at all shareholder proposals but at this point in the process we do not expect to comment on them.” Verizon spokesman Bob Varettoni declined to comment on the shareholder proposal it received except to say the company is evaluating it. Customers in growth markets like China have historically mistrusted U.S. technology corporations. Those fears have been stoked by disclosures from former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. For instance, Cisco Systems Inc last week blamed what some analysts call “the Snowden effect” in part for dismal quarterly revenue. Others have questioned the financial impact of the revelations, however. In response many technology companies have pushed for — or at least aimed to be seen pushing for — transparency in their dealings with U.S. intelligence agencies. Companies including Google Inc, Microsoft Corp, Twitter Inc, Facebook Inc, Apple Inc and Yahoo! Inc have published “transparency reports” showing government data requests. Some have in addition gone to court seeking to disclose more details. But the two big telecommunications companies have not responded as aggressively to the data requests, the shareholder activists note in their resolutions. Specifically, the resolutions cite press reports of the intelligence agencies’ involvement with the companies, and the resulting criticism from figures like Brazil’s president Dilma Rousseff, who called U.S. monitoring activities “a breach of international law.” The resolutions call on AT&T; and Verizon to publish semi-annual reports, subject to current laws, “providing metrics and discussion regarding requests for customer information by U.S. and foreign governments, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information.” Trillium has $1.3 billion under management and calls itself the oldest independent investment adviser focused on sustainable and responsible investing. Trillium and other activists have used shareholder proposals in the past to air out arcane issues such as several “network neutrality” measures it brought at AT&T; and Verizon since 2012. One at Verizon in the spring won support from 24 percent of shareholders.

586,VZ,"RPT-INSIGHT-For Intel, Hollywood dreams prove a leap too far","(Repeats INSIGHT to widen distribution) By Noel Randewich, Ronald Grover  and Liana B. Baker Nov 20 (Reuters) - Earlier this year, Intel Corp rented temporary retail space in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago for a splashy launch of Intel TV, a new Internet entertainment service that the chipmaker promised could revolutionize the television industry. But when customers walk into those stores this holiday season, they will not find any set-top TV boxes or programming services for sale. Instead, they will see ultra thin laptops and new tablets from a variety of vendors that Intel hopes will help boost its massive but flagging computer chip business. The drastic change in plans for the retail spaces follows the company’s abrupt abandonment of a grand plan to become an entertainment hub in living rooms around the world - a retreat that has been rumored but not yet acknowledged by the company. The project faced daunting challenges from the start, and Intel’s new CEO, Brian Krzanich, ultimately decided the company could not afford the distraction and expense, sources familiar with the decision told Reuters. At his first annual investor day on Thursday, Krzanich is expected to discuss the growing use of chips in everyday devices, plans to breath new life into PCs, and Intel’s growing contract manufacturing business - but not Intel TV. Sources close to the project confirmed media reports that Intel Corp is looking to sell the TV technology, called OnCue, with Verizon Communications Inc emerging as the most likely buyer. An Intel spokesman declined to comment. Intel’s retreat is a disappointment not only to former British Broadcasting Corp executive Erik Huggers, who led the project, but also to others in Silicon Valley who saw it as part of a wave of next-generation digital television products that might help break open a market tightly controlled by a handful of cable companies and entertainment conglomerates. Technology heavyweights including Apple Inc,  Amazon.com Inc  Google Inc Sony Corp  and Microsoft Corp all have similar ambitions. Yet thus far only Netflix Inc has proven to be a major disruption to the lucrative relationship between pay TV operators and the entertainment companies that provide them with content. Intel, a storied semiconductor company that has struggled to manage the transition from traditional personal computers to mobile devices, was always an unlikely player in the digital television wars. Its traditional strengths are in chip design and manufacturing, and it has little experience selling consumer products, much less television programming. But Paul Otellini, Intel’s CEO from 2005 until May of this year, saw an opportunity for Intel to diversify into a new consumer business, one centered on a high-tech set-top box and a slick user interface. The often-clunky hardware and software provided by cable companies, and the highly controlled structure of cable packages, seemed to beg for a better solution. Otellini entrusted the project to Huggers, a veteran TV executive who all but boasted that he knew nothing about chips. Huggers, who had originally pitched the idea, developed a business plan, and soon set up his group in offices with the flashy look of a media startup on the chipmaker’s Santa Clara, California, campus. Making his case for Intel TV to the public for the first time in Feburary 2013 at a conference near Los Angeles, Huggers assured the audience that Intel would not offer channels a la carte, an industry buzz word despised by entertainment companies that count on “bundling” lower rated channels with popular ones. But Huggers also said Intel would offer channel packages that “are bundled right,” which many in Hollywood took to mean an attempt to slice off the less popular channels - something  that would not come cheaply or easily. While Intel never said how much it planned to charge for its TV service, Huggers billed it as a premium product, rather than a cut-rate option for consumers hoping to save money by canceling their cable subscriptions. Huggers ultimately made only modest progress negotiating slimmer packages of channels, people familiar with the talks said. Still, by this summer, Huggers had more than 300 employees and was testing the OnCue device in the homes of thousands of Intel employees. Many people who saw a prototype of the device, a nondescript black box, and toyed with the all-important graphical interface software, described OnCue as far superior to what is generally offered by cable and satellite TV companies. Representatives for Verizon, Viacom Inc, NBC  , CBS, Fox, Time Warner Inc  and Disney’s ABC all declined to comment on their discussions with Intel. Krzanich, a manufacturing expert who won the top job after the Intel board decided to stick with an in-house executive, never shared Otellini’s interest in Intel TV. Meeting with a group of reporters a month into his tenure as CEO, he spoke for an hour about his mobile chip strategy. When pressed about the TV business he struck a surprisingly cautious tone, saying the company is not expert at content. Intel’s TV project was a distraction to Krzanich, company sources say. He spent his first six months as CEO focused on two threats to the chipmaker’s core business - a declining PC industry and a lack of progress in smartphones and tablets. “It’s not wrong for them to look for growth wherever they can find it because they need to,” said Bernstein semiconductor analyst Stacy Rasgon. “But (Krzanich) has enough on his plate to worry about.” While Huggers came close to finalizing deals with some of the major programmers, according to industry sources on both sides of the talks, the terms were such that Intel would have faced upfront outlays in the hundreds of millions regardless of how quickly the service caught on, the same sources say. “The problem is Intel’s appetite for the size of the financial risk required to launch,” said Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG, noting the big commitments to media companies as well as large consumer marketing and customer service operations. He pegged launch costs in the hundreds of millions of dollars but declined to be more specific. Intel also had to make concessions to media companies that might have made it harder to sell the service: Viewers streaming previously aired shows from some networks would not be allowed to fast-forward through commercials, for example.

587,VZ,"INSIGHT-For Intel, Hollywood dreams prove a leap too far","Nov 20 (Reuters) - Earlier this year, Intel Corp rented temporary retail space in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago for a splashy launch of Intel TV, a new Internet entertainment service that the chipmaker promised could revolutionize the television industry. But when customers walk into those stores this holiday season, they will not find any set-top TV boxes or programming services for sale. Instead, they will see ultra thin laptops and new tablets from a variety of vendors that Intel hopes will help boost its massive but flagging computer chip business. The drastic change in plans for the retail spaces follows the company’s abrupt abandonment of a grand plan to become an entertainment hub in living rooms around the world - a retreat that has been rumored but not yet acknowledged by the company. The project faced daunting challenges from the start, and Intel’s new CEO, Brian Krzanich, ultimately decided the company could not afford the distraction and expense, sources familiar with the decision told Reuters. At his first annual investor day on Thursday, Krzanich is expected to discuss the growing use of chips in everyday devices, plans to breath new life into PCs, and Intel’s growing contract manufacturing business - but not Intel TV. Sources close to the project confirmed media reports that Intel Corp is looking to sell the TV technology, called OnCue, with Verizon Communications Inc emerging as the most likely buyer. An Intel spokesman declined to comment. Intel’s retreat is a disappointment not only to former British Broadcasting Corp executive Erik Huggers, who led the project, but also to others in Silicon Valley who saw it as part of a wave of next-generation digital television products that might help break open a market tightly controlled by a handful of cable companies and entertainment conglomerates. Technology heavyweights including Apple Inc,  Amazon.com Inc  Google Inc Sony Corp  and Microsoft Corp all have similar ambitions. Yet thus far only Netflix Inc has proven to be a major disruption to the lucrative relationship between pay TV operators and the entertainment companies that provide them with content. Intel, a storied semiconductor company that has struggled to manage the transition from traditional personal computers to mobile devices, was always an unlikely player in the digital television wars. Its traditional strengths are in chip design and manufacturing, and it has little experience selling consumer products, much less television programming. But Paul Otellini, Intel’s CEO from 2005 until May of this year, saw an opportunity for Intel to diversify into a new consumer business, one centered on a high-tech set-top box and a slick user interface. The often-clunky hardware and software provided by cable companies, and the highly controlled structure of cable packages, seemed to beg for a better solution. Otellini entrusted the project to Huggers, a veteran TV executive who all but boasted that he knew nothing about chips. Huggers, who had originally pitched the idea, developed a business plan, and soon set up his group in offices with the flashy look of a media startup on the chipmaker’s Santa Clara, California, campus. Making his case for Intel TV to the public for the first time in Feburary 2013 at a conference near Los Angeles, Huggers assured the audience that Intel would not offer channels a la carte, an industry buzz word despised by entertainment companies that count on “bundling” lower rated channels with popular ones. But Huggers also said Intel would offer channel packages that “are bundled right,” which many in Hollywood took to mean an attempt to slice off the less popular channels - something  that would not come cheaply or easily. While Intel never said how much it planned to charge for its TV service, Huggers billed it as a premium product, rather than a cut-rate option for consumers hoping to save money by canceling their cable subscriptions. Huggers ultimately made only modest progress negotiating slimmer packages of channels, people familiar with the talks said. Still, by this summer, Huggers had more than 300 employees and was testing the OnCue device in the homes of thousands of Intel employees. Many people who saw a prototype of the device, a nondescript black box, and toyed with the all-important graphical interface software, described OnCue as far superior to what is generally offered by cable and satellite TV companies. Representatives for Verizon, Viacom Inc, NBC  , CBS, Fox, Time Warner Inc  and Disney’s ABC all declined to comment on their discussions with Intel. Krzanich, a manufacturing expert who won the top job after the Intel board decided to stick with an in-house executive, never shared Otellini’s interest in Intel TV. Meeting with a group of reporters a month into his tenure as CEO, he spoke for an hour about his mobile chip strategy. When pressed about the TV business he struck a surprisingly cautious tone, saying the company is not expert at content. Intel’s TV project was a distraction to Krzanich, company sources say. He spent his first six months as CEO focused on two threats to the chipmaker’s core business - a declining PC industry and a lack of progress in smartphones and tablets. “It’s not wrong for them to look for growth wherever they can find it because they need to,” said Bernstein semiconductor analyst Stacy Rasgon. “But (Krzanich) has enough on his plate to worry about.” While Huggers came close to finalizing deals with some of the major programmers, according to industry sources on both sides of the talks, the terms were such that Intel would have faced upfront outlays in the hundreds of millions regardless of how quickly the service caught on, the same sources say. “The problem is Intel’s appetite for the size of the financial risk required to launch,” said Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG, noting the big commitments to media companies as well as large consumer marketing and customer service operations. He pegged launch costs in the hundreds of millions of dollars but declined to be more specific. Intel also had to make concessions to media companies that might have made it harder to sell the service: Viewers streaming previously aired shows from some networks would not be allowed to fast-forward through commercials, for example. Still, Intel TV would have offered far easier navigation, simple access to archived programming, and innovations in advertising delivery and personalized services. It would have also held out the potential for other features that could be readily implemented with an advanced Intel-powered set-top box and associated Internet-based services.

588,VZ,"Shareholders raise surveillance concerns at AT&T;, Verizon","BOSTON/NEW YORK, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Shareholders of telecom giants AT&T; Inc and Verizon Communications Inc are seeking more details related to their sharing of customer information with governments, showing investors starting to push back over the role of communications companies in spying operations. Activists including Trillium Asset Management of Boston and the $161 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund have filed proposals for the spring shareholder meetings of AT&T; and Verizon, representatives said. Both resolutions call on the companies to report semi-annually on “metrics and discussion regarding requests for customer information by U.S. and foreign governments.” As carriers of massive amounts of voice and data traffic, the telecommunications companies have been at the center of controversies over the use of their data by U.S. intelligence agencies. Just on Monday the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge to a ruling that gave the government access to Verizon records of millions of telephone calls. [ ID: nL2N0J315X ] A worry is the close ties could hurt the companies’ business, said Trillium Senior Vice President Jonas Kron. “From an investor perspective, this is one of those issues where there’s an overlap of interests” among privacy advocates and business groups, Kron said. He cited surveys that spying fears could cut tens of billions of dollars from the sales of cloud computing services. AT&T; spokesman Mark Siegel said that  “As standard practice we look carefully at all shareholder proposals but at this point in the process we do not expect to comment on them.” Verizon spokesman Bob Varettoni declined to comment on the shareholder proposal it received except to say the company is evaluating it. Customers in growth markets like China have historically  mistrusted U.S. technology corporations. Those fears have been stoked by disclosures from former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. For instance, Cisco Systems Inc  last week blamed what some analysts call “the Snowden effect” in part for dismal quarterly revenue. Others have questioned the financial impact of the revelations, however. [ ID: nL2N0HA03X ] In response many technology companies have pushed for — or at least aimed to be seen pushing for — transparency in their dealings with U.S. intelligence agencies. Companies including Google Inc, Microsoft Corp, Twitter Inc, Facebook Inc, Apple Inc and Yahoo! Inc have published  “transparency reports” showing  government data requests. Some have in addition gone to court seeking to disclose more details. But the two big telecommunications companies have not responded as aggressively to the data requests, the shareholder activists note in their resolutions. Specifically, the resolutions cite press reports of the intelligence agencies’ involvement with the companies, and the resulting criticism from figures like Brazil’s president Dilma Rousseff, who called U.S. monitoring activities “a breach of international law.” The resolutions call on AT&T; and Verizon to publish semi-annual reports, subject to current laws, “providing metrics and discussion regarding requests for customer information by U.S. and foreign governments, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information.” Trillium has $1.3 billion under management and calls itself the oldest independent investment adviser focused on sustainable and responsible investing. Trillium and other activists have used shareholder proposals in the past to air out arcane issues such as several “network neutrality” measures it brought at AT&T; and Verizon since 2012. One at Verizon in the spring won support from 24 percent of shareholders. Even when such measures don’t pass, activists see them as a way to call attention to issues. “Often the utility of such resolutions is to generate conversation with and among management, particularly if the company has refused to engage in other ways,” said Christine Bader, a lecturer on human rights and business at Columbia University. She is also affiliated with the Global Network Initiative, a privacy-advocacy group that counts some of the technology companies as participants. Filers of the AT&T; proposal include the New York State fund, Trillium, the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, and Arjuna Capital, according to a statement from Open MIC, a non-profit organization in New York that works with investors on media issues and helped organize the resolutions. Filers of the Verizon proposal include Trillium, the ACLU chapter, the Park Foundation, and Clean Yield Asset Management, the activists said.",11202013,http://www.reuters.com/article/surveillance-telecom-proxy/shareholders-raise-surveillance-concerns-at-att-verizon-idUSL2N0J519D20131120

594,VZ,"UPDATE 1-U.S. regulators to consider in-flight calls, text messaging","By Alina Selyukh and Karen Jacobs WASHINGTON/ATLANTA, Nov 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission is considering allowing airplane passengers to use their cellphones for calls and text messaging during flights, setting up a challenging debate over technical and social implications. Last month, the Federal Aviation Administration said it would allow expanded use of electronic devices aboard planes, ending a long-standing ban. But the devices are still not allowed to connect to any ground networks and FCC rules have long banned the use of cellphones aboard. The new proposal, to be voted on at the FCC’s Dec. 12 meeting, would let the airlines decide whether to allow passengers to make phone calls, send texts or otherwise using their own wireless data and call services - although still not during takeoff or landing. “Modern technologies can deliver mobile services in the air safely and reliably, and the time is right to review our outdated and restrictive rules,” FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said on Thursday in announcing that he has circulated the proposal. But the battle could turn out to be a lengthy challenge as experts warn that passengers are not too welcoming of the prospect of listening to their neighbors chatter during flight. Delta Air Lines, for instance, said on Thursday it would not allow cellphone use even if the FCC approves it, citing an “overwhelming sentiment” in customer feedback against voice calls in flight. United Continental and Southwest Airlines  also said their customers have expressed concerns about cellphone use during flight. Both carriers said they would study any changes the FCC might make. “Passengers overwhelmingly reject cell phone use in the aircraft cabin,” the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA union said, urging the FCC to not proceed with its proposal. The union expressed concerns that the conversations could be a distraction during emergencies and imperil safety. Some experts also questioned whether the new rules would put a virtually impossible burden on flight attendants to ensure that cell phones are on but disconnected from the networks during takeoff and landing before the plane reaches 10,000 feet. In fact, concerns about use of cellphones have already once killed a similar push at the FCC to relax its ban. The agency reviewed the matter from 2004 to 2007 - in the era predating the widespread use of smartphones and gadgets connected to wireless networks through providers such as AT&T; Inc, Verizon Communications Inc or Sprint Corp. The Telecommunications Industry Association, which represents makers and suppliers of communication networks, said it supported the FCC decision. The five-member FCC will vote on the new proposal and then collect a new round of comments. It would eventually finalize its rules in conjunction with the FAA, which last month relaxed the rule that electronic devices be shut down during takeoff and landing. FCC officials say the new proposal would impose some technical requirements for airlines that decide to allow use of phones onboard. Experts point out that the technology already exists to collect phone calls and route them to the ground, solving the problem of having to jump from one cell tower to another to complete the call. Some airlines in Europe, the Middle East and Asia already allow in-flight phone use, FCC officials say. The FCC in May also started deliberations on a proposal that would offer a new type of in-flight broadband service promising passengers higher Wi-Fi speeds and better connections. U.S. air travelers can already access the Internet on some flights. But the speed of such service, which rely either on connections with antennas on the ground or satellites, is slow.

595,VZ,Troubled HealthCare.gov to switch U.S. Web hosts after contract change,"WASHINGTON, Nov 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. government is switching providers of Web hosting services for the troubled HealthCare.gov website, replacing Verizon Communications Inc’s  Terremark subsidiary with  Hewlett-Packard Co, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said on Wednesday. The contract with Terremark for the site’s data center ends in March 2014, and last summer - after CMS issued a “task order,” HP was the successful bidder, a CMS spokesman said in a statement. Now, CMS needs to transition its data center to HP at a time when it is just beginning to dig out from a mountain of problems with the website, which is designed to let consumers shop for health insurance required under President Barack Obama’s signature reform law. “CMS has begun the necessary activities to transition the data center over to HP. We are working to ensure a smooth transition between the two contractors,” the CMS spokesman said. The contract award happened several months before the botched Oct. 1 launch of HealthCare.gov. The contract was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Verizon has received $55.4 million for its work on the healthcare marketplaces since its contract started in 2011, according to federal contracting records show. Both companies declined comment, as did the White House, which referred questions about the contract to CMS. The Obama administration has said it plans to have the website working smoothly for most users by this weekend. The CMS spokesman did not respond to questions about whether the transition between data center providers would affect the website.

598,VZ,Vodafone sees Verizon deal finalized around early March,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L) expects to close the $130 billion sale of its 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless to Verizon Communications (VZ.N) and that shareholders will have received the proceeds of the deal by early March in line with the companies’ target for a first quarter close. The companies announced a cash and stock deal on September 2 after Verizon, which already controls Verizon Wireless, tried for roughly a decade to buy the Vodafone stake. While Vodafone noted that some dates could be subject to change, it said in a timetable posted online on Tuesday that the transaction is expected to be completed in late February after which it aims for cash payments to be made to its shareholders for the deal on March 4. Shareholders of both Vodafone and Verizon, already the majority owner of Verizon Wireless, are expected to vote on the deal roughly a month before on January 28. Verizon said on December 4 that it had won approval for the deal from U.S. regulators.

599,VZ,Vodafone sees Verizon deal finalized around early March,"NEW YORK, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Vodafone Group Plc  expects to close the $130 billion sale of its 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless to Verizon Communications and that shareholders will have received the proceeds of the deal by early March in line with the companies’ target for a first quarter close. The companies announced a cash and stock deal on Sept. 2 after Verizon, which already controls Verizon Wireless, tried for roughly a decade to buy the Vodafone stake. While Vodafone noted that some dates could be subject to change, it said in a timetable posted online on Tuesday that the transaction is expected to be completed in late February after which it aims for cash payments to be made to its shareholders for the deal on March 4. Shareholders of both Vodafone and Verizon, already the majority owner of Verizon Wireless, are expected to vote on the deal roughly a month before on Jan. 28. Verizon said on Dec. 4 that it had won approval for the deal from U.S. regulators.

Kron said Trillium has provided more detail, but that Verizon’s action suggests it will sidestep the usual process in which companies ask the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to skip votes on shareholder proposals. “If they are going to challenge the shareholder proposal, I hope they will work within the SEC process,” Kron said. Verizon spokesman Bob Varettoni said via email the company’s response as routine. “At this point, we have not taken any formal position on the proposal,” he wrote. “The SEC requires shareholders to demonstrate their eligibility to submit a proposal.

Generally, corporate shareholders who own $2,000 worth of stock for a year may file proposals for a vote by all investors. But the rise of proposals with a social agenda or those put forth by labor groups has prompted many companies to push back, often by seeking SEC permission to skip the measures. The agency grants such permission about half the time.

604,VZ,Canada to cap domestic wireless roaming rates,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada will introduce legislation to cap roaming rates that big telecom providers charge their smaller rivals, the government said on Wednesday, aiming to breathe life into its sputtering drive to foster competition in the wireless industry. In announcing the new rules, Industry Minister James Moore said Canada’s big wireless companies charge rivals as much as 10 times the rate they charge their own customers for roaming voice, data and text services. “For too long, Canadian consumers in the wireless sector have been the victims of these high roaming costs,” Moore said in a statement announcing Ottawa’s plans to submit an amendment to the Telecommunications Act within weeks. The governing Conservatives hold a majority in the House of Commons, assuring passage of the bill. The legislation would allow the three national carriers - Rogers Communications Inc, BCE Inc and Telus Corp - to charge their competitors no more than the rate they charge their own retail customers. BCE, parent of Bell Canada, shares a coast-to-coast network with Telus. The government hopes the cap on wholesale rates will encourage smaller carriers to cut consumer prices and improve service outside their own coverage zones, which tend to be confined to major metropolitan areas. “This move neutralizes the ‘reach’ dimension of the incumbents’ advantage,” said Iain Grant, managing director of telecom consultancy Seaboard Group. “A big step forward.” The government also said it would step up enforcement of existing regulations, giving the telecom regulator and the industry department the power to fine companies that break rules on such things as the sharing of cellular towers. Previously, the bodies could only withdraw a license from an operator, an option that was never used, Grant said. The high cost of roaming has had a damaging effect on new entrants in the wireless market, which have sought to win customers with low-cost plans and must rely on the established carriers to provide coverage in many areas of the country. In a 2008 auction of wireless airwaves, the government set aside spectrum for newcomers in a bid to loosen the dominance of the three big providers. Since then, however, the new entrants have found it hard to survive. One of them, Public Mobile, was recently acquired by Telus, and another, Mobilicity, is under creditor protection as it seeks a buyer. That leaves Globalive’s Wind Mobile as the last newcomer standing. Some analysts and company executives, however, complain that government policies have confused and discouraged companies weighing a move into the country’s telecoms industry. Ottawa has twice blocked Telus, which has no wholesale roaming deals with new entrants, from buying Mobilicity. Verizon Communications Inc had offered to buy Wind and was in talks to acquire Mobilicity, sources said in June, but the U.S. telecom giant ultimately decided to stay away. Globalive’s main backer, Europe-focused Vimpelcom, has said it is considering exiting the market, and Canada’s next crucial auction of airwaves, due to start next month, has failed to draw interest from any major foreign telecoms. Canaccord Genuity analyst Dvai Ghose said the move on roaming was likely too little, too late, and that it would have a negligible effect on the bottom lines of the big carriers. He said Rogers, as the main provider of roaming services for the new entrants, likely brings in around C$50 million from it, compared with C$6.8 billion in network revenue this year. Supporting that thesis, the share prices of Rogers, BCE and Telus were all up on the Toronto Stock Exchange early on Wednesday afternoon. Still, Wind’s chief legal officer, Simon Lockie, said the new rule shows that the federal government is serious about helping consumers by aiding competition. “It is now clear that this government is taking the realistic and committed actions necessary to create a level playing field for competition in the wireless space,” he said. The government move preempts a review currently in process at the industry regulator, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. In August the CRTC sought information from all players in the industry on wireless roaming, and has said it will consider next year whether the large Canadian carriers are unfairly imposing more restrictive terms on domestic rivals than on U.S.-based carriers. The government said its measure would remain in place until the CRTC makes a decision on whether to limit roaming rates. It is not the first time the Conservative government has sought to influence policy at the CRTC. In 2011, the CRTC backed away from its own ruling that would have effectively stopped small Internet providers from offering unlimited downloads after the industry minister threatened to block the decision. In the same year, the government went to court to argue that Globalive qualified as a Canadian enterprise after the CRTC said it wasn’t. Canadian status meant Globalive did not run afoul of limits on foreign involvement in telecoms. Ottawa has since lifted those restrictions for small carriers.

605,VZ,UPDATE 1-Verizon to detail government information requests,"Dec 19 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc said it would regularly report information on government requests for customer data from now on, following pressure from activist shareholders. A group of investors, concerned about the role of telephone companies in government spying operations, last month pushed Verizon and AT&T; Inc to disclose details on their sharing of customer information with governments. The Verizon move may put pressure on AT&T; to follow suit. Verizon on Thursday promised to publish online reports with data on the number of law enforcement requests for customer information it has in the United States and other countries in which it does business. It said it would publish its first report early next year with data on 2013 requests and will update the information twice a year after that to provide more transparency. Previously, Verizon tended to disclose such data in response to ad hoc requests from legislators rather than broadly publishing the data. This would be the first time it publishes a report that would be easily accessible to shareholders. In its statement, Verizon also called on “governments around the world to provide more information on the types and amounts of data they collect and the legal processes that apply when they do so.” Technology companies such as Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp, Google Inc and Facebook Inc have already disclosed the number of information requests they received from governments around the world. They have also said publicly that they would like to provide more information to their customers. However, telephone operators like Verizon have been much less outspoken than their technology and Internet counterparts in the matter, leading shareholders to propose a vote at the operators’ annual meeting to try to force more disclosure. One of the proxy resolution’s backers, Jonas Kron of Trillium Asset Management in Boston, said Verizon’s plan looked positive, at least at first glance. “It appears they’ve really embraced our concerns,” Kron said in a telephone interview. But he added that the shareholder group had not yet spoken with Verizon about its latest step and would need more time to decide whether or not they would withdraw their request for a vote at Verizon’s springtime shareholder meeting. The decision will hinge on factors such as how much detail Verizon plans to publish about its interactions with law enforcement, he said. Earlier this month, AT&T; asked regulators to let it ignore a similar request from its shareholder. It did not immediately respond to the Verizon announcement on Thursday. Verizon said in a statement that all companies are required to give information to government agencies in certain circumstances and that its new report was intended to create more transparency.",12192013,http://www.reuters.com/article/verizon-security-report/update-1-verizon-to-detail-government-information-requests-idUSL3N0JY3JL20131219

A Verizon spokesman, Robert Varettoni, said the company was already making plans for an online transparency report before it received the shareholder requests in November. Still, advocates including Massachusetts Senator Edward Markey, praised Verizon’s approach as a way to make disclosures more routine. Markey, a Democrat, had been tracking growing government use of wireless surveillance. “Verizon is taking an important step toward transparency, and I call on the other wireless carriers to follow its lead and regularly disclose their law enforcement requests for wireless information,” Markey said in a statement. Verizon shareholders had proposed a proxy resolution for the company’s springtime shareholder meeting, calling for it to  issue reports on its cooperation with government agencies.

Asked if it might follow Verizon’s latest move, an AT&T; spokesman said, “While we have disclosed a lot of information in this area, we are always exploring ways to do more.” One of the shareholders pressing AT&T; is New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who oversees a retirement fund for state workers. In a statement, DiNapoli praised Verizon’s move and said that AT&T; should follow its lead. Verizon said its report will show the number of law enforcement agency requests received in criminal cases and would break out this data under categories such as subpoenas, court orders and warrants. It also said that it would provide details about legal demands it receives in requests for information in emergencies. It said it is working with the U.S. government regarding the detail it can report on the number of National Security Letters it received last year. But it said that its report will not disclose information about other national security requests received by the company.

611,VZ,Verizon CEO says U.S. may demand spectrum sales for mobile merger,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A deal that reduces the U.S. mobile market to three national operators from four could raise eyebrows at regulators and require the merging parties to sell spectrum, according to Verizon Communications Chief Executive Lowell McAdam. McAdam was responding on Tuesday to a question about whether such a deal could be approved at an investor conference after reports that No. 3 U.S. mobile service Sprint Corp is looking into the possibility of buying No. 4 rival T-Mobile U.S.. While the executive said he does not have any inside knowledge about U.S. regulators’ thinking he said that a current escalation of mobile competition may be the result the government was looking for when it blocked No. 2 mobile operator AT&T; Inc from buying T-Mobile in 2011. “I think they’re (regulators are) beginning to see some of the things they wanted to see from four competitors ... so I think they’ll want to play out that hand,” McAdam said during a webcast of an investor conference in Las Vegas. McAdam suggested regulators would only approve any Sprint/T-Mobile deal if the companies involved agreed to sell a lot of their spectrum as a condition for approval. “I’ll look forward to all the spectrum that’ll be divested from that group,” as a result of such a deal, McAdam said. Demand for wireless airwaves has risen sharply as U.S. operators scramble to boost their networks to support increasing consumer Web surfing and video use on cell phones. McAdam has made no secret of the fact that Verizon Wireless, Verizon’s venture with Vodafone Group Plc, is always on the lookout for opportunities to buy more spectrum. The executive was asked if Verizon Wireless would consider some kind of spectrum sharing deal with satellite TV provider Dish Network, which owns spectrum but has no network on which it can put the spectrum to use. McAdam said that he thinks Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen has spoken to everybody in the industry about his options but he said “a model may emerge but so far a model hasn’t emerged. Time will tell whether there’s something there for both parties.” Asked about increasing competition being stemmed by aggressive discounting by T-Mobile, McAdam said that “price competition is typically short-lived” in the mobile industry. The executive said he expects Verizon to work with content providers this year to test mobile Internet-based video services. These are known in the industry as “over-the-top” services because they do not use traditional cable networks. Verizon currently competes with cable companies with its FiOS home television service. It plans to close a deal to buy Vodafone’s 45 percent share of Verizon Wireless in late February.

Retail and telecom stocks ranked among the day’s biggest losers. The S&P; retail sector index slipped 0.2 percent after a number of retailers, including Bed Bath & Beyond  and Family Dollar, slashed their earnings forecasts. The S&P; telecom services sector index fell 1.9 percent, pulled lower by AT&T; and Verizon Communications, which were the top decliners in the Dow Jones industrial average. Nonfarm payrolls are expected to have added 196,000 jobs last month, according to a Reuters survey of economists, slightly below November’s count of 203,000.

Shares of Five Below Inc, a teen-oriented retailer of trendy jewelry and other items priced at $1 to $5, also tumbled more than 15 percent in extended-hours trading after cutting its earnings outlook. The stock ended the regular session at $43.59, down 3.2 percent.

617,VZ,Debt markets braced for Charter test,"NEW YORK, Jan 17 (IFR/RLPC) - Charter Communications  will test the capacity of the high-yield bond and leveraged loan market the way Verizon did in investment-grade if it is successful in its attempted takeover of Time Warner Cable (TWC). Its USD37.3bn hostile bid, based on an offer of USD132.50 a share, would require as much as USD24bn in debt financing. Although the details of the package still need to be ironed out, and could change if Charter increases its rejected offer or joins up with a rival such as Comcast, it will probably be structured as a Double B type credit with about six times leverage, bankers said. Regardless of the fine-tuning, the bonds and loans each have the potential to be record-breakers in terms of size. The bond component will probably overtake Sprint’s USD6.5bn deal that was priced last year as the largest ever junk bond, while the loan piece could surpass HJ Heinz’s USD9.5bn loan from last year - and even Clear Channel’s USD10.7bn deal from 2008. With about USD60bn in debt, the combined company would also become the biggest high-yield issuer in the market - larger even than Telecom Italia - raising some questions as to how much investors will be able to own in the name. Despite this, bankers are confident the deal can be done - likening it to the USD28bn buyout of Heinz last year by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which needed about USD14bn of new debt. Even another big potential deal in the market requiring jumbo financing shouldn’t matter, something bankers have to consider given speculation that Sprint  - 80% owned by SoftBank Corp - may bid for T-Mobile. “This isn’t going to be a seven times leveraged deal with no equity. It will have a Double B type capital structure, and investors say they need deals like this in size,” said one debt capital markets banker. As one investor put it: “The market is wide open.” Charter, rated Ba3/BB- by Moody’s and S&P;, described the financing package as “prudent, with a longer tenor than Charter today and low cost”. It has fully negotiated USD20.5bn in new debt and a USD3.5bn bridge loan with its four banks - Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs - and would also need to refinance existing debt of both companies if the deal goes through. “There’s bound to be a lot of playing around to see where the company can get the most benefit and the cheapest cost of capital,” said one analyst. That almost certainly means that TWC’s existing USD25bn bonds will stay in place. Currently rated Baa2/BBB/BBB, those bonds will be the cheapest debt Charter will have at its disposal, though they will almost certainly fall to junk status. Moody’s is so far the only agency to place the ratings of the companies on review for downgrade. “I can’t see any reason why those bonds will not be left in the capital structure. Just as in the Heinz buyout, they will be subordinated, and the new bonds will come in above them,” said another leveraged finance banker. “It makes no sense to take them out. They not only provide cheap debt, but they limit the amount of new debt that has to be raised.” With no change of control language in those bonds, their prices in secondary trading have sunk. In fact, they have been trading more like a Ba1 entity since talk of a bid first emerged last summer. There is some protection for bondholders that will affect the structure of the bond financing, but it’s pretty negligible. Moody’s reckons that only USD4bn-USD5bn of new secured debt can be added to the new capital structure due to indentures on the TWC bonds that cap the amount of additional liens of secured debt. The bottom line, though, is that this is just the first round of what is inevitably going to be a long process. Major TWC shareholders have said they would be receptive to a higher offer, but there’s also a chance that other cable players such as Cox could surface with rival bids. Then there’s Liberty Media. Analysts at CreditSights say Liberty could inject USD4bn to USD5bn of cash into Charter in order to maintain a 27% stake in the combined Charter/TWC entity - a move that would limit the amount of debt Charter would have to raise. Liberty has several pockets of liquidity it could tap, they say, including margin loans and the ability to raise incremental funds at SIRI. A cash injection of that magnitude could keep the Charter leverage only modestly above five times, with a quick roadmap back below that level through growth and synergies, CreditSights said. As the first analyst said: “Whatever happens, TWC is now fully in play.”",1172014,http://www.reuters.com/article/charter-timewarnercable-debt/debt-markets-braced-for-charter-test-idUSL5N0KR28F20140117
618,VZ,Analysis: Verizon deal may push U.S. cable to offer online TV services,"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc’s acquisition of Intel Corp’s venture to create a web-based TV service may be the catalyst that pushes U.S. cable players to start similar products to fend off fast-growing video rivals such as Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc. The deal, announced on Tuesday, came two weeks after Sony Corp revealed it was working on its own cable-like video service and makes it likely that Internet-delivered TV services may be getting closer after attempts from Apple Inc and other technology companies. Amazon has also considering an online TV service, and has been talking with content owners about licensing TV networks, according to the Wall Street Journal. Verizon said it acquired Intel Corp’s OnCue service for an undisclosed sum to accelerate its push into next-generation video services, including integrating it with its FiOS product, the fiber-based Internet and TV offering that has 5.3 million video subscribers, about 5 percent of pay TV households. In a more ambitious move, Verizon also says it intends to deliver “over the top to any device,” which almost certainly would kick off a race to capture eyeballs that will force cable operators to offer standalone services outside their service territories. “For Verizon this could be an opportunity for them to offer a triple play to subscribers in the rest of the country,” said Blair Westlake, who until recently headed Microsoft Corp’s media and entertainment group. “If you’re a Comcast that may get you thinking that it’s time to start offering video in other markets as well.” Verizon has the brand, marketing dollars and customer relationships to make it a viable threat to cable operators, said UBS analyst John Hodulik. There is a likely market waiting for it as well. North American consumers will spend $6 billion in 2014 on entertainment from over-the-top services such as Netflix, more than twice what they spent in 2010, according to PwC’s annual entertainment and media forecast. Cable TV operators, meanwhile, are losing video subscribers to satellite and telecom operators, according to SNL Kagan, putting pressure on their operating margins due to rising programming costs. If Verizon’s move prompts a similar bid from cable companies, it would upset a decades-long balance in the cable TV industry, which operates in near monopoly status with markets carefully carved up by local governments. Customers could choose between Comcast and Time Warner Cable for their video service, or Verizon for that matter. Comcast may be furthest along with a potential over-the-top service with its Xfinity X1 platform, which allows a subscriber to its traditional video service to toggle between live and on-demand programming with a slick interface. A Comcast spokeswoman said the company is focused on getting that product released across its markets and not on an “over-the-top” service. “If Comcast really launches one, it starts a war between all the different cable companies that are already incumbents,” said BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield. “That probably means they fight over price, service and features that are great for the consumer.” It won’t be easy for a new entrant to get started, however. Content owners so far have not granted cable operators the digital rights to sell their shows outside their markets. That has not stopped both cable and satellite companies from eyeing the opportunity. Both Time Warner Cable Inc and satellite operator DirecTV bid on Hulu - the video streaming site owned by Walt Disney Co’s ABC network, Comcast’s NBCUniversal and Fox parent Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. Hulu’s owners, the major content companies, decided instead to invest in it rather than sell it. Charter, which has made a bid to buy No. 2 cable provider Time Warner Cable, has openly floated the idea. “We may sell subscriptions everywhere,” Charter Chief Executive Officer Tom Rutledge said in an November conference call, responding to a question about Charter’s streaming TV application. Cable’s competitors aren’t sitting idle. DirecTV CEO Mike White has said the No. 1 satellite operator is working on an “over-the-top” video package to suit niche audiences, such as Hispanic or kids programming. DirecTV’s rival Dish Network Corp is also eyeing the online opportunity. “We’re thinking of over the top too,” Dish CEO Joe Clayton said on the sidelines of the Consumer Electronics Show in early January. Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson research, is skeptical that online video newcomers such as Sony can be profitable enough to take on the incumbents. When folks start using huge amounts of bandwidth for TV viewing, he predicts Internet bills will jump as providers start charging by usage. “A virtual provider like Sony could be left with a me-too service,” Moffett says, “and an even higher total cost to the end user than the Pay TV subscription they would be hoping to replace.” For some cable operators, this could mean opportunity emerging from the chaos. Cablevision Systems Corp CEO James Dolan, for one, has said he sees a future in which cable operators no longer use their wires to offer video service and instead just offer broadband Internet, which makes more money.

619,VZ,US STOCKS-S&P; 500 ends with slight gains; IBM falls late,"* Dow Chemical jumps on Third Point stake * Verizon, Travelers and J&J; all fall after results * IBM down, Cree rises in extended trading after results * Dow off 0.3 pct, S&P; up 0.3 pct, Nasdaq up 0.7 pct By Ryan Vlastelica NEW YORK, Jan 21 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks mostly rose on Tuesday, with the S&P; 500 snapping a two-session decline as the materials sector rallied, though the Dow fell on disappointing earnings by three of its components. Trading was volatile, with the S&P; fluctuating between positive and negative territory throughout the session, while the Dow moved between modest and solid losses and the Nasdaq swung between modest and strong gains. The S&P; materials index rose 0.6 percent as one of the best performing major S&P; indexes, led by a 6.6 percent gain in Dow Chemical to $45.93. Activist investor and hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb has taken a stake in the company and wants it to spin off its petrochemical arm. In addition, Alcoa Inc jumped 6.8 percent to $12.13 following an upgrade to “overweight” from JPMorgan. The firm also lifted its price target on the aluminum company to $15 from $9. Energy stocks, another group with some correlation to the pace of economic growth, advanced 0.5 percent. “We still think economically-sensitive stocks have room to run... Those have the potential to be long-term winners,” said Jeff Mortimer, director of investment strategy for BNY Mellon Wealth Management in Boston. The Dow fell as Travelers Cos Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Johnson & Johnson - all bellwethers for their sectors - tumbled following results. Travelers fell 1.7 percent to $85 after posting a profit that beat expectations, though investors worried about the insurance provider’s margins. Verizon lost 1.3 percent to $47.70, while J&J; dropped 1.1 percent to $94.03 after it gave a forecast at the low end of analyst expectations. According to Thomson Reuters data, earnings for the fourth quarter are expected to grow 7 percent over the prior year. Of the 61 companies in the benchmark S&P; index that have reported so far, about 56 percent topped analyst expectations, below the long-term average of 63 percent. About 71 percent have topped revenue forecasts, above the long-term average of 61 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 44.12 points, or 0.27 percent, at 16,414.44.

622,VZ,Verizon revenue climbs on sturdy mobile growth,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc reported faster subscriber growth and stronger profits than expected at its Verizon Wireless venture with Vodafone Group Plc, easing some concerns about intensifying competition if only temporarily. Investors are worried market leader Verizon Wireless, which is paying $130 billion for Vodafone’s 45 percent share in their venture, will cut prices as discounts from No. 4 U.S. mobile service T-Mobile U.S. have drawn responses from No. 2 service AT&T; Inc and No. 3 ranked Sprint Corp. While investors still worry about competition in 2014, Verizon’s ability to beat profit and subscriber estimates for the fourth quarter show that it did not overpay to keep customers from switching to rivals so far at least, analysts said. Verizon, which also announced a small acquisition of the media assets of Intel Corp on Tuesday, saw its shares fall more than 2 percent, despite the strong results. Some investors appeared to be selling their Verizon shares to hedge their investments ahead of the Vodafone deal, which is expected to close February 21, according to Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche. She said that others, while happy with the fourth quarter, sold from frustration that Verizon has to wait until after the deal close to set financial targets for 2014. “Nothing in this quarter’s results made me worry they weren’t holding their own versus the competition,” Fritzsche said. But she noted that investors may have wanted more reassurance Verizon will not get roped into a price war. Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said Verizon would respond to competitive pressure when it needs to, and that it tends to set its pricing agenda for the year in January and February, but declined to provide further details. “What he said adds fire to the worry rather than calming it,” Fritzsche said. Verizon Wireless added 1.6 million subscribers in the quarter, compared with the 1.5 million average estimate of five analysts contacted by Reuters. This beat subscriber growth numbers at T-Mobile US for the quarter. Its profit margin was 47 percent in the quarter based on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of wireless service revenue beat the expectation of four analysts for a margin closer to 46 percent. Verizon, which also competes with cable operators for video and internet customers, agreed to buy Internet TV technology from chip maker Intel but did not disclose the deal terms. It plans to use Intel’s technology to improve search and discovery features for Verizon’s wireline FiOS video service and to help it build a platform to deliver video to mobile devices, Shammo told analysts on the company’s conference call. Verizon Communications said it earned $5.07 billion, or $1.76 per share, in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $4.23 billion, or $1.48 per share, in the year-ago period, including pension-related charges in both quarters. Excluding unusual items, its earnings per share of 66 cents beat Wall Street expectations by a penny. Revenue increased to $31.1 billion from $30.05 billion a year earlier. Wall Street expected $31.02 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company said wireless customer defections, known in the industry as churn, increased slightly from the year-ago quarter but fell from the third quarter.

The S&P; materials index gained 0.9 percent as the  best performing of the 10 major S&P; indexes, led by a 4.9 percent gain in Dow Chemical to $45.18. Activist investor and hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb has taken a stake in the company and wants it to spin off its petrochemical arm. “Dow Chemical is kind of behind sort of a broader market rise with the idea there is still value, or at least one respected hedge fund thinks there is still some value in a specific stock,” said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. Also adding support to the materials sector was Alcoa Inc , which advanced 4.8 percent to $11.90 after JP Morgan upgraded the stock to an “overweight” from a neutral” rating and boosted its price target to $15 from $9 per share. But three Dow components fell after reporting earnings, giving back advances made before the opening bell. Travelers Cos Inc lost 2 percent to $84.75 after the insurance provider posted a more than three-fold rise in fourth-quarter profit. Fellow Dow components Verizon Communications Inc fell 1.6 percent to $47.58 and Johnson & Johnson lost 2.2 percent to $92.97 as the biggest drag on the S&P; 500. “There is some legitimate concern for investors that good news is factored into existing prices. In terms of earnings, this has been a market of ‘sell on the news,’ because the stocks have run so far, so you really have to surprise on the upside to maintain gains in some of these stocks,” said Meckler. Verizon said its quarterly revenue rose 3.4 percent, slightly ahead of Wall Street estimates as it added more subscribers than expected at its Verizon Wireless venture with Vodafone Group Plc. JNJ reported quarterly results that came in above Wall Street estimates on sharply higher sales of its prescription drugs and improving sales of its medical devices.

628,VZ,"Vodafone, Verizon investors back $130 billion Verizon Wireless deal","LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shareholders of both Vodafone (VOD.L) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) approved Verizon’s $130 billion takeover of their Verizon Wireless venture on Tuesday, paving the way for the third biggest deal in corporate history. Vodafone shareholders voted for one of the biggest payouts ever as 71 percent of the deal’s net proceeds - or $84 billion including stock - will be returned to Vodafone shareholders from the sale of Vodafone’s 45 percent interest in Verizon Wireless to majority owner Verizon. “This is the largest single return of value to shareholders in history,” Vodafone Chairman Gerard Kleisterlee told the shareholders at a meeting in London. He said it left Vodafone in a strong financial position and represented “the opening of an important new chapter in the history of Vodafone.” Lowell McAdam, Verizon chairman and CEO, said the purchase will give Verizon more financial flexibility to invest in new technologies. “This is critical because we believe that, when it comes to wireless growth, we are just getting started,” McAdam said in a statement. With Vodafone selling one of its largest divisions and the biggest U.S. wireless service, speculation has mounted that the British firm could itself become a bid target. AT&T; (T.N), the second largest U.S. mobile operator, on Monday ruled out a bid for Vodafone after being forced to make its intentions clear by Britain’s takeover panel but bankers and analysts say it may still make a bid in the future. When asked by an investor about AT&T;’s reported interest in buying Vodafone, Kleisterlee said: “I read the newspapers as you do, and I cannot comment on the speculation around Vodafone and AT&T; at this point of time.” Holders of 99.76 percent of Vodafone’s shares backed the Verizon Wireless sale, which is expected to conclude on February 21, with the share consolidation and return of value taking place three days later. In a preliminary count, about 97 percent of Verizon votes cast were in favor of the proposal, according to the company. Under the terms of their deal announced in September, Vodafone is to get $58.9 billion in cash, $60.2 billion in Verizon stock, and an additional $11 billion from smaller transactions. Verizon needed shareholder approval to issue up to 1.28 billion shares to Vodafone shareholders to proceed with the deal. At its special meeting on Tuesday shareholders also gave Verizon the go-ahead to increase the number of shares issued by an additional 2 billion. This was not a condition for the Verizon Wireless deal, but will allow for additional stock to support Verizon’s growth and provide flexibility, the company said. Verizon shares were down one cent at $47.68 on the New York Stock Exchange after the news. Vodafone shares closed roughly flat at 223.44 pence in London.

632,VZ,"UPDATE 3-Vodafone, Verizon investors back $130 bln Verizon Wireless deal","By Paul Sandle and Sinead Carew LONDON/NEW YORK, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Shareholders of both Vodafone and Verizon Communications Inc approved Verizon’s $130 billion takeover of their Verizon Wireless venture on Tuesday, paving the way for the third biggest deal in corporate history. Vodafone shareholders voted for one of the biggest payouts ever as 71 percent of the deal’s net proceeds - or $84 billion including stock - will be returned to Vodafone shareholders from the sale of Vodafone’s 45 percent interest in Verizon Wireless to majority owner Verizon. “This is the largest single return of value to shareholders in history,” Vodafone Chairman Gerard Kleisterlee told the shareholders at a meeting in London. He said it left Vodafone in a strong financial position and represented “the opening of an important new chapter in the history of Vodafone.” Lowell McAdam, Verizon chairman and CEO, said the purchase will give Verizon more financial flexibility to invest in new technologies. “This is critical because we believe that, when it comes to wireless growth, we are just getting started,” McAdam said in a statement. With Vodafone selling one of its largest divisions and the biggest U.S. wireless service, speculation has mounted that the British firm could itself become a bid target. AT&T;, the second largest U.S. mobile operator, on Monday ruled out a bid for Vodafone after being forced to make its intentions clear by Britain’s takeover panel but bankers and analysts say it may still make a bid in the future. When asked by an investor about AT&T;’s reported interest in buying Vodafone, Kleisterlee said: “I read the newspapers as you do, and I cannot comment on the speculation around Vodafone and AT&T; at this point of time.” Holders of 99.76 percent of Vodafone’s shares backed the Verizon Wireless sale, which is expected to conclude on Feb. 21, with the share consolidation and return of value taking place three days later.

634,VZ,U.S. seeks trials to test transition to digital phone networks,"WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - U.S. wireless providers like AT&T; Inc and Verizon Communications Inc on Thursday received a nod from regulators to test a transition of the telephone industry away from traditional analog networks to digital ones. The Federal Communications Commission unanimously voted in favor of trials, in which telecommunications companies would test switching telephone services from existing circuit-switch technology to an alternative Internet protocol-based one to see how the change may affect consumers. The experiments approved by the FCC would not test the new technology - it is already being used - and would not determine law and policy regulating it, FCC staff said. The trials would seek to establish, among other things, how consumers welcome the change and how new technology performs in emergency situations, including in remote locations. “What we’re doing here is a big deal. This is an important moment,” FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said. “We today invite service providers to propose voluntary experiments for all-IP networks.” The move in part grants the application by AT&T; to conduct IP transition tests as companies that offer landline phone services seek to ultimately replace their old copper wires with newer technology like fiber or wireless. “We cannot continue requiring service providers to invest in both old networks and new networks forever,” Commissioner Ajit Pai, a Republican, said. Some consumers, particularly in rural or hard-to-reach areas, have complained about poor connectivity of their IP-based services. Advocates have also expressed concerns about the impact of the transition on consumers with disabilities. “I think we must be mindful of the impact this transition has on consumers — their needs, their expectations and their willingness to embrace network change,” said Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat. The trials will be voluntary, and regulators require that the experiments “cover areas with different population densities and demographics, different topologies, and/or different seasonal and meteorological conditions.” They also require that no consumers be left disconnected.",1302014,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fcc-iptransition/u-s-seeks-trials-to-test-transition-to-digital-phone-networks-idUSL2N0L414G20140130
635,VZ,U.S. boosting investment in high-speed Internet in schools by $2 bln,"WASHINGTON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The Federal Communications Commission, doubling its investment in high-speed Internet at schools, on Monday pledged an additional $2 billion over two years for improving broadband networks in schools and libraries. The investment comes through E-Rate, a subsidy program funded by fees Americans pay on their monthly phone bills that helps schools and libraries get discounts on Internet services and digital devices. Created in 1996, E-Rate has been giving schools around $2.4 billion a year. But demand has far exceeded that amount, FCC officials have said, and of all E-Rate funding, only about half has gone toward equipping schools and libraries with true high-speed Internet access, the agency said. In what FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler called a “business-like approach,” the agency would reshuffle how it spends the current E-Rate funds to prioritize high-capacity Internet connections over other purposes and to improve the program’s efficiency and management. While most experts agree on the benefits and the need to modernize E-Rate, opinions have differed on how to fund the changes. At first the additional funds will come from unused money from previous years, the FCC said in detailing its plans to boost spending on high-speed Internet. Later, funds would come from reforms the FCC is considering for the E-Rate program, such as no longer paying for outdated technologies, including paging or dial-up Internet. The effort is part of President Barack Obama’s push to connect 99 percent of U.S. schools to high-speed broadband and wireless Internet within five years to spur use of digital technology in the classrooms. Nearly all U.S. schools have access to basic Internet, the FCC said, but the speed and quality at many is far from ideal. The new funds would be targeted toward “the most urgent Internet upgrade needs,” the agency said. The FCC said its increased investment in high-speed Internet will connect 20 million students at 15,000 schools. Wheeler is expected to address the changes further in a speech later this week. The White House is working with companies such as tech giants Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp, and wireless providers Sprint Corp and Verizon Communications Inc on other ways to improve digital experiences in American schools. Schools and libraries are clamoring for faster Internet speeds to promote digital learning, which has been shown to improve test scores and graduation rates.",2032014,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fcc-erate/u-s-boosting-investment-in-high-speed-internet-in-schools-by-2-bln-idUSL2N0L81LD20140203
636,VZ,Sprint chairman to meet with top U.S. telecom regulator Monday,"WASHINGTON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Sprint Corp Chairman Masayoshi Son is slated to meet with Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler on Monday, an FCC official said, as the No. 3 U.S. wireless provider mulls a potential bid for smaller rival T-Mobile US Inc. Son’s Tokyo-based SoftBank Corp acquired Sprint last year and has recently been in talks to acquire T-Mobile US, sources have told Reuters. FCC chiefs routinely meet with industry executives in sessions that often cover a wide range of topics. Sprint Chief Executive Dan Hesse was also scheduled to attend Monday’s meeting, the FCC official said, speaking anonymously because the FCC chairman’s schedule is not public. Son in recent weeks has been pushing for more consolidation in a U.S. wireless market dominated by four major providers: Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T; Inc, Sprint and T-Mobile. Sprint has been interested in combining with T-Mobile for years and top executives from both companies have argued that consolidation was necessary in the U.S. wireless market, as cooperation in infrastructure and equipment orders would create a stronger rival against the biggest players, Verizon and AT&T.; However, the deal would face strong headwinds in getting regulators’ approval at the Justice Department and the FCC. U.S. antitrust chief, William Baer, last week reiterated his skepticism toward any mergers between any of the two top four wireless phone companies. Baer and Wheeler have both hailed the 2011 rejection of a merger between AT&T; and T-Mobile as yielding a more competitive market that is better for consumers. AT&T; over the weekend announced a plan to cut prices on its large shared data plans in the latest sign that the rivalry between the top U.S. cellular players may be triggering increased discounting.",2032014,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-sprint-fcc/sprint-chairman-to-meet-with-top-u-s-telecom-regulator-monday-idUSL2N0L80LP20140203
637,VZ,Fitch Rates Verizon Communications' Proposed Note Offering 'A-'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to  Verizon Communications Inc.'s (NYSE: VZ) proposed notes, consisting of euro or  sterling notes, or a combination thereof. VZ's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is  'A-' and the Rating Outlook is Stable. The primary use of proceeds from the offering will be to finance, in part, the  company's acquisition of Vodafone Group, PLC's (Vodafone) 45% interest in Cellco  Partnership (which does business as Verizon Wireless). Net proceeds so used will  reduce anticipated borrowings under the company's term loan, which provides for  up to $12 billion in borrowings to finance the acquisition. To the extent  offering proceeds are not used to finance the acquisition, they will be used for  general corporate purposes.  KEY RATING DRIVERS --In February 2014, VZ's proposed $130 billion acquisition of Vodafone's 45%  interest in Cellco Partnership (which does business as Verizon Wireless) is  expected to close. Shareholders of both companies have approved the transaction.  The transaction remains subject to the approval of the High Court of Justice of  England and Wales, and other closing conditions. --The acquisition pressures VZ's near-term credit metrics, pushing pro forma  leverage at closing to approximately 2.7x. Subsequent to the close of the  acquisition, Fitch expects VZ to materially reduce debt over the next few years.  EBITDA growth, combined with debt reductions is expected to reduce leverage to  approximately 2x by the end of 2016, which Fitch believes is appropriate for an  'A-' rating. --Fitch is cognizant that leverage will be outside an appropriate range for an  'A-' rating for several years. However, Fitch has a high level of confidence  metrics will return to a level appropriate for the rating due to the company's  strong position in the wireless industry and the significant cash flows  generated by the wireless business, in combination with management's commitment  to delever. Management's commitment to delevering has been shown in the past by  the aggressive delevering following the acquisition of Alltel Corporation in  early 2009. Other supporting factors include the absence of operations-related  execution risk. --A key to debt reduction over the next several years will be the continued  generation of strong free cash flow (FCF) at Verizon Wireless (VZW). VZW's  simple FCF (EBITDA less capital spending) in 2013 was approximately $24.8  billion. VZ's consolidated FCF (after dividends and capital spending but before  distributions to Vodafone) was $16.3 billion in 2013. Fitch estimates FCF will  be at least 50% lower in 2014 as a result of transaction-related interest costs,  higher dividend requirements due to the shares issued to Vodafone equity holders  and higher cash taxes.  --The strong competitive position of VZW as evidenced by industry-low churn  rates, high margins and the most developed LTE network in the U.S. support  expectations for VZ's cash flow stability and the longer rating horizon embodied  in the rating.  VZ's gross leverage at year-end 2013 was 2.2x, with total debt at $93.6 billion.  Consolidated cash balances of $53.5 billion on Dec. 31, 2013 include proceeds  from the $49 billion of debt issued in September 2013 to finance the  transaction, and as a result net leverage was only 1.0x.  To finance the remainder of the transaction, VZ will draw on a $12 billion term  loan, with anticipated borrowings on the loan reduced by any proceeds from the  current offering. The term loan's principal financial covenant requires leverage  to be 3.5x or less but falls away upon achieving 'A-' ratings, as defined in the  agreement. VZ's liquidity is supported by a $6.2 billion credit facility, and Fitch expects  the company to maintain aggregate CP balances within a level fully backed by the  facility. The credit facility has no ratings triggers or other restrictive  covenants, such as leverage or interest coverage tests. In August 2013, the  facility was extended for a year and now matures in August 2017. After the  effect of letters of credit (LOCs), approximately $6.1 billion is available on  the facility. In October 2013, VZ entered into a $2 billion 364-day revolving  credit facility, which may be drawn upon after the wireless transaction closes.  The 364-day facility has a 3.5x leverage covenant. On a consolidated basis, VZ  and its subsidiaries have scheduled debt maturities of approximately $3.2  billion and $2.6 billion in 2014 and 2015, respectively. In 2014, Fitch expects consolidated capital spending to range from $16.5 billion  to $17 billion, comparable to or slightly higher than the $16.6 billion spent in  2013. Investment in the wireless network continues to be an area of emphasis due  to the strong demand for 4G LTE capacity for rapidly growing data services.  RATING SENSITIVITIES A positive rating action could occur if: --Fitch believes a positive rating action is unlikely in the foreseeable future,  given the leverage incurred in the Vodafone transaction. A negative rating action could occur if: --Operating performance causes delevering to take place at a materially slower  than anticipated pace. --A weakening of VZW's competitive position that would jeopardize the stability  of cash flows.

638,VZ,CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Redbox operator Outerwall raises buyback after profit beat (Feb 6),"(Removes reference to Redbox being a joint venture between Verizon and Outerwall. Outerwall’s Redbox Instant is the joint venture) * Fourth-quarter adj core EPS from cont ops $1.68 vs est $1.22 * Rev $593.7 mln vs est $596.1 mln * Hires Warner Bros Home Entertainment executive to run Redbox unit * Shares up 10 pct after market By Lehar Maan Feb 6 (Reuters) - Outerwall Inc raised its share buyback program by $500 million to about $650 million, and named a Warner Bros Home Entertainment executive to run its Redbox video-rental business. Outerwall shares rose 10 percent in extended trading after the company reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by cost cuts. The company also said it planned to launch a modified Dutch auction tender offer for $350 million of its common stock on Feb. 7. “They are about to shrink their share count by a significant amount,” Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter told Reuters. The buyback is likely to reduce the number of shares by 4.5 million, Pachter said. The company had 27.6 million shares outstanding as of Dec. 31. Outerwall, looking to cut costs, said in December that it would reduce its workforce by 8.5 percent and discontinue three new ventures - Rubi coffee kiosks, Crisp Market food kiosks and Star Studio photo booths. “We do expect to generate $22 million of annualized savings beginning this quarter from the restructuring actions we announced in December,” Chief Financial Officer Galen Smith  told analysts on a conference call. The company on Thursday named Mark Horak as president of its Redbox division, replacing Anne Saunders. Horak comes from Warner Bros Home Entertainment Inc, an unit of Time Warner Inc . Warner Bros Home Entertainment provides services such as video-on-demand and subscriptions for its videos via cable, satellite, online and mobile channels. Outerwall also owns and operates about 20,300 coin-counting kiosks, where consumers feed loose change into the kiosks, which count the change and then dispense vouchers. The company’s net income marginally fell to $22.7 million, or 82 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, from $22.9 million, or 75 cents per share, a year earlier. Adjusted core diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.68 per share. Analysts had expected adjusted earnings of $1.22 per share on revenue of $596.1 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 5.4 percent to $593.7 million but missed the average analyst estimate of $596.1 million. Redbox revenue rose marginally to $496.4 million, and Coinstar unit revenue rose 8.4 percent to $80.7 million. Outerwall forecast first-quarter core diluted share from continuing operations of 77 cents to 97 cents per share on consolidated revenue of $570 million to $600 million. Analysts on average were expecting adjusted earnings of $1.29 per share on revenue of $607.1 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of the company closed at $63.64 on the Nasdaq on Thursday.

639,VZ,Vodafone windfall to give FTSE a February fillip,"* U.S. joint venture exit to return billions to UK market * Citi estimates minimum $8 bln to return to UK by end-Feb * FTSE 100 could get a 2-3 pct boost, buck 2014 lag * Vodafone may fall if funds hold too much vs index weight By Simon Jessop and Sudip Kar-Gupta LONDON, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Britain’s sluggish stock market could get a boost as Vodafone investors sell the Verizon  shares they acquired through a $130 billion buyout of the telecom’s U.S. joint venture. Verizon’s takeover of Verizon Wireless, the third-biggest deal in corporate history, tees up an $84 billion payout in cash and shares at the end of February, which many may look to reinvest in UK stocks. The market impact will ripple through currencies, funding markets, cash markets and derivatives, and could boost prices for stocks ranging from Vodafone’s sector peer BT to the smallest stocks in the FTSE All-Share index. The UK funds which hold many Vodafone shares often have a remit to invest in UK companies, either actively or by passively tracking indices such as the FTSE 100 or the FTSE All-Share. “For some of these funds, it could be 2-3 percent of their fund’s AuM (assets under management) returned to them in cash. Their mandates might dictate that this is too much for them not to reinvest it straight away,” said Ben Lynch, Citi’s Global Head of Centralised Risk Trading. While the impact is hard to gauge, some estimate the FTSE 100 could gain as much as 3 percent from the flow and move back into profit for the year from its current 1.5 percent loss. On Feb. 19, the cash/stock ratio for the deal is announced and on Feb. 21, Vodafone shareholders will get a cash tranche amounting to 30 percent of the deal total in dollars, which UK holders may need to convert to pounds and reinvest. While active managers can begin positioning straight away, FTSE trackers will have to wait until Feb. 25 before reinvesting the proceeds of the share portion of the deal. Given that, and the fact the cash portion does not clear until early March, some may choose to buy FTSE futures before exchanging into a cash position later, Lynch said. How much of that money comes back to the UK market is not absolute, but Lynch said “at a minimum that’s about $8 billion” from European passive investors “but it could quickly get up to $35 billion over those two tranches”, dependent on what active funds choose to do. Which companies get a slice of the pie and how that affects their share price will depend on who is spending and when. Income funds, for example, may look to replicate the bumper dividend yield offered by Vodafone by investing in large blue-chips such as BP, Royal Dutch Shell and GlaxoSmithKline. Peter Botham, chief investment officer at Brown Shipley, which manages around 3.5 billion pounds, said “the vast majority of private clients” would likely make such a play. As well as influencing the dollar-pound exchange rate, options pricing in currencies, stocks and indexes, it could also result in Vodafone being sold off if some funds end up owning too much of the stock relative to its index weight. Hobart Capital director Justin Haque recommended buying the FTSE 100 while selling dollars and Vodafone and Verizon shares, adding in a note to clients that “the money shift will be eye-watering”. Those who track or benchmark themselves against the FTSE All-Share index, meanwhile, may look to bump up their holdings in smaller companies, many of which have relatively low traded volumes and could therefore get a proportionately bigger boost. Others, particularly active fund managers, may choose to park the funds in cash and wait for better opportunities, such as a potential Lloyds Banking Group share sale in March or April, said Lynch.",2112014,http://www.reuters.com/article/ftse-vodafone/vodafone-windfall-to-give-ftse-a-february-fillip-idUSL5N0LG17H20140211

642,VZ,UPDATE 2-Netflix to pay Comcast for faster speeds,"Feb 23 (Reuters) - Netflix  has agreed to pay one of the largest broadband providers in the United States Comcast Corp for faster speeds, throwing open the possibility that more content companies will have to shell out for better service. Comcast and Netflix made the joint announcement on Sunday, marking the first time that Netflix is paying for faster speeds in the U.S. after customers complained about slow service. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The arrangement comes as federal regulators are wrestling with an issue known as “Net neutrality” concerning broadband providers and whether they can slow down traffic to particular websites, potentially forcing content companies to pay for faster Web service.

647,VZ,Verizon targets higher EBITDA margin for 2014,"Feb 24 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc said it was targeting a higher adjusted EBITDA margin and 4 percent revenue growth for 2014 after it completed the acquisition of Vodafone Group’s 45 percent stake in their Verizon Wireless joint venture. The margin on adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization was 34.9 percent in 2013, while revenue growth was 4.1 percent. Shareholders of Vodafone and Verizon approved the $130 billion takeover in January, paving the way for the third-biggest deal in corporate history. Verizon said on Monday it expected to reduce debt and fund network investments this year with continued strong cash flows, which would also support its dividend policy. Evercore Partners analyst Jonathan Schildkraut said Verizon’s equipment instalment plans, which allow customers to upgrade to new phones and pay for them in instalments, could lead to better EBITDA margins, but at the expense of short-term cash flows. Verizon, which had net debt of $40.1 billion as of Dec. 31, 2013, raised its quarterly dividend by 2.9 percent to 53 cents per share in September and said that providing a strong dividend would remain a priority.",2242014,http://www.reuters.com/article/verizon-outlook/verizon-targets-higher-ebitda-margin-for-2014-idUSL3N0LT42H20140224

651,VZ,Wall St. slips on day after S&P; hits record high,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged lower on Tuesday, easing back from record territory a day earlier as weak economic data offset gains in Home Depot (HD.N) and other retail shares. Seven out of the 10 S&P; 500 sector indexes ended lower, led by financials .SPSY and industrials .SPLRCI, while consumer discretionaries .SPLRCD led on the upside. The day’s data showed gains in U.S. home prices slowed in December, according to the S&P;/Case-Shiller index, while the consumer confidence index fell more than expected in February. Selling picked up slightly late in the session as traders unwound positions after the S&P; 500 failed to break above Monday’s intraday record high of 1,858.71, analysts said. The index remained in negative territory, down 0.2 percent, for the year. “We tried to break out again and retest the highs, and since we failed, people are lightening up their positions they took earlier,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. Home Depot shares jumped 4 percent to close at $80.98, giving the biggest boost to both the Dow and the S&P; 500. Home Depot’s earnings beat expectations, though sales fell more than expected in the fourth quarter. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 27.48 points or 0.17 percent, to end at 16,179.66. The S&P; 500 .SPX slipped 2.49 points or 0.13 percent, to finish at 1,845.12. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 5.38 points or 0.13 percent, to close at 4,287.587. Shares of Macy’s Inc (M.N) gained 6 percent to $56.25 after the department store operator reported a drop in January sales, but said fourth-quarter earnings rose from the previous year. While many analysts have pinned the weakness to harsh winter weather rather than deteriorating fundamentals, the retail earnings suggest that spending has not dried up. “There are a couple of credible pieces of information that didn’t get caught in the snow drifts,” said Fred Dickson, chief market strategist at D.A. Davidson & Co in Lake Oswego, Oregon. “Consumers are spending.” The S&P; retail index .SPXRT rose 1.9 percent, while the consumer discretionary index gained 0.5 percent. Investors are anxious to hear from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, who is due to speak on Thursday to the Senate Banking Committee in her semiannual testimony about monetary policy. Her comments will be scoured for insight into how bad weather has affected economic activity, as well as for confirmation that the Fed will not change its schedule for trimming stimulus. Among other corporate results, Tenet Healthcare Corp (THC.N) late Monday swung to a net loss in its fourth quarter. Tenet’s adjusted earnings, however, were better than expected. Its stock slid 9.1 percent to close at $43.93. Perry Ellis International Inc (PERY.O) shares tumbled 17.5 percent to $12.93, their lowest level since late 2011, a day after the clothing company forecast a decline in quarterly revenue. After the bell, shares of First Solar Inc (FSLR.O) dropped 12.3 percent to $50.90 after the solar panel maker reported that its fourth-quarter net income fell 58 percent. About 6.7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 7 billion average so far this month, according to data from BATS Global Markets.

654,VZ,S&P; 500 ends near flat; retailers fly for a second day,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks finished flat on Wednesday with investors hesitant to make a big move on the day before comments from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, though retailers’ shares rallied on results for a second day. Target Corp (TGT.N) and Lowe’s Cos Inc (LOW.N) shares jumped following upbeat earnings and gave the biggest boosts to the S&P; 500. An S&P; 500 retail index .SPXRT gained more than 1 percent for a second day. After the bell, shares of J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N) climbed 12.8 percent to $6.72 as the U.S. department store chain forecast more improvement in its comparable sales and gross profit margin this fiscal year. The S&P; 500 once again briefly broke above its 2013 year-end closing level of 1,848.36, which has served as resistance, but failed to hold above it, analysts said. The index remained down 0.2 percent for the year. “From a technical perspective, we’re battling with the year-to-date break-even mark on the S&P;,” said Todd Salamone, vice president of research at Schaeffer’s Investment Research in Cincinnati, Ohio. “It just seems ... there’s no firm commitment to drive the S&P; back above this particular level.” But he said the market also seems to be biding time until Thursday, when Yellen addresses the Senate Banking Committee in semiannual testimony about monetary policy. This appearance, originally set for February 13, had to be postponed when Washington was walloped with the heaviest snowfall of the season. Her comments will be scrutinized for insight into how much an unexpectedly cold winter has affected economic activity, and for confirmation that the Fed will maintain its stimulus-trimming schedule. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 18.75 points or 0.12 percent, to end at 16,198.41. The S&P; 500 .SPX inched up a mere 0.04 of a point to finish at 1,845.16. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 4.477 points or 0.10 percent, to close at 4,292.064. The S&P; 500 reached a record intraday high of 1,858.71 on Monday, but was unable to hit a record close. The small-cap Russell 2000 index ., however, climbed to a record closing high of 1,181.72 on Wednesday. Adding to investor anxiety were developments in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin put 150,000 combat troops on high alert for war games near Ukraine. In the retail sector, Target’s stock jumped 7 percent to close at $60.49 after the company reported results. The third-largest U.S. retailer said sales and earnings had been affected by a massive data breach and that costs relating to the event could hurt future profits. Lowe’s stock rose 5.4 percent to end at $50.72 after the No. 2 U.S. home improvement retailer reported earnings and sales growth and unveiled an additional stock-buyback program of $5 billion. The S&P; 500 retail index gained 1.4 percent. Wednesday’s strong retail performance came a day after upbeat results from Macy’s (M.N) and Home Depot (HD.N). Home Depot shares on Wednesday closed up 0.9 percent at $81.71 after rising to $82.71, a lifetime high. Macy’s stock jumped 3 percent to close at $57.96, off a 52-week high at $58.65. On the economic front, new home sales surged to a 5-1/2-year high in January, far exceeding expectations. While much recent data has been below forecasts, analysts have attributed that to bad weather rather than worsening fundamentals. The housing data could support that interpretation. The day’s decliners included First Solar Inc (FSLR.O), whose shares fell a day after the U.S. solar panel maker reported that its fourth-quarter net income fell 58 percent. First Solar’s stock slid 9.1 percent to end Wednesday’s session at $52.74. Among other after-the-bell movers, shares of Autodesk (ADSK.O) rose 3.7 percent to $56.76 following the release of the computer-aided design (CAD) software maker’s results. About 6.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 7 billion average so far this month, according to data from BATS Global Markets.

She could have excluded weather and perhaps talked more about the soft patch,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, which is based in Newark, New Jersey. “I think she gave the market some comfort that she thought it was probably mostly due to weather-related issues.” Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Yellen also said the Fed would watch carefully to make sure weather was indeed behind the recent weakness. But she said it would take a “significant change” to the economy’s prospects for the central bank to put plans to reduce its bond-buying program on hold. Some retailers scored sharp gains for a third session, with the shares of J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N) and others jumping after the companies posted strong results. Mylan Inc (MYL.O) gave one of the biggest boosts to both the S&P; 500 and Nasdaq. Mylan’s shares shot up 9.4 percent to end at $56.27 after the U.S. generic drugmaker gave a 2014 forecast above Wall Street’s estimates. Mylan also said it plans to make a “substantial” transaction this year that would add to future earnings. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 74.24 points or 0.46 percent, to end at 16,272.65. The S&P; 500 .SPX gained 9.13 points or 0.49 percent, to finish at 1,854.29, surpassing its previous record closing high set on January 15. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 26.869 points or 0.63 percent, to close at 4,318.933. For the year, the S&P; 500 index is now up 0.3 percent. After the bell, Gap Inc (GSP.N) shares slid 1 percent to $43.24 after the clothing retailer reported results. Shares of Deckers Outdoor Corp DECK.O tumbled 12.5 percent to $74.05 after the company, whose brands include UGG boots and Teva sandals, posted earnings. During the regular session, J.C. Penney shares surged 25.3 percent to $7.47, a day after the U.S. department store chain forecast more improvement in its comparable sales and gross profit margin this fiscal year. The S&P; retail index .SPXRT has climbed 4.2 percent for the week so far, including its slim gain of 0.1 percent on Thursday. Among other retailers, Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N) reported a better-than-expected profit on Thursday. The stock rose as high as $28.19 before ending at $25.57, down 1 percent. Sears Holding Corp (SHLD.O) reported a quarterly loss that narrowed from the year-ago period, sending its stock up 6.5 percent to $43.01. Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N) said it expected modest sales gains in its new fiscal year and reported a lower fourth-quarter profit. Shares of Kohl’s rose 2.4 percent to $55.74. The day’s economic data added to the positive tone, with orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods excluding transportation, or durable goods excluding transportation, and a gauge of business spending unexpectedly rising in January. About 6.5 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 7 billion average so far this month, according to data from BATS Global Markets. Advancers beat decliners on the New York Stock Exchange by a ratio of 2 to 1. On the Nasdaq, 17 stocks rose for every nine that fell.

657,VZ,Fitch Rates Verizon's $6.6B Term Loans 'A-'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 28 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to the  following debt issues for Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ): --$3.3 billion term loan due 2017; --$3.3 billion term loan due 2019; --$2 billion 364-day revolving credit facility due February 2015. Fitch currently rates VZ's IDR 'A-' with a Stable Rating Outlook. Proceeds from the term loans formed part of the $130 billion in consideration  used to acquire Vodafone Group, PLC's (Vodafone) 45% interest in Cellco  Partnership (which does business as Verizon Wireless) on Feb. 21, 2014.  KEY RATING DRIVERS --The acquisition of the remaining Verizon Wireless (VZW) stake pressures VZ's  near-term credit metrics, pushing pro forma leverage at closing to approximately  2.7x. Subsequent to the close of the acquisition, Fitch expects VZ to materially  reduce debt over the next few years. EBITDA growth, combined with debt  reductions is expected to reduce leverage to approximately 2x by the end of  2016. Fitch believes this level is appropriate for an 'A-' rating. --Fitch is cognizant that leverage will be outside an appropriate range for an  'A-' rating for several years. That said, Fitch has a high level of confidence  metrics will return to a level appropriate for the rating due to VZ's strong  position in the wireless industry and the significant cash flows generated by  the wireless business. This is in combination with Verizon management's  commitment to delever, evident by the aggressive delevering following the  acquisition of Alltel Corporation in early 2009. Other supporting factors  include the absence of operations-related execution risk. --A key to debt reduction over the next several years will be the continued  generation of strong free cash flow (FCF) at VZW. VZW's simple FCF (EBITDA less  capital spending) in 2013 was approximately $24.8 billion. VZ's consolidated FCF  (after dividends and capital spending but before distributions to Vodafone) was  $16.3 billion in 2013. Fitch estimates FCF will be at least 50% lower in 2014 as  a result of transaction-related interest costs, higher dividend requirements due  to the shares issued to Vodafone equity holders and higher cash taxes.  --The strong competitive position of VZW as evidenced by industry-low churn  rates, high margins and the most developed LTE network in the U.S. support  expectations for VZ's cash flow stability and the longer rating horizon embodied  in the rating.  VZ's gross leverage at year-end 2013 was 2.2x, with total debt at $93.6 billion.  Consolidated cash balances of $53.5 billion on Dec. 31, 2013 include proceeds  from the $49 billion of debt issued in September 2013 to finance the  transaction. As a result net leverage was only 1.0x.  VZ's liquidity is supported by a $6.2 billion credit facility. Fitch expects VZ  to maintain aggregate CP balances within a level fully backed by the facility.  The credit facility has no ratings triggers or other restrictive covenants, such  as leverage or interest coverage tests. In August 2013, the facility was  extended for a year and now matures in August 2017. After the effect of letters  of credit (LOCs), approximately $6.1 billion is available on the facility. The 364-day revolving credit facility has a 3.5x leverage covenant, as do the  term loans. The term loans leverage covenant falls away upon achieving 'A-'  ratings, as defined in the agreement. On a consolidated basis, VZ and its  subsidiaries have scheduled debt maturities of approximately $3.2 billion and  $2.6 billion in 2014 and 2015, respectively. In 2014, Fitch expects consolidated capital spending to range from $16.5 billion  to $17 billion, comparable to or slightly higher than the $16.6 billion spent in  2013. Investment in the wireless network continues to be an area of emphasis due  to the strong demand for 4G LTE capacity for rapidly growing data services.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch believes a positive rating action is unlikely in the foreseeable future,  given the leverage incurred in the Vodafone transaction. Conversely, Fitch may take negative rating action if: --Operating performance causes delevering to take place at a materially slower  than anticipated pace; --A weakening of VZW's competitive position that would jeopardize the stability  of cash flows.

658,VZ,Verizon in talks with content providers for online video service,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications is in talks with content providers to deliver web-based TV services to mobile platforms, chief executive Lowell McAdam, said at an investor conference on Tuesday. A day earlier, Dish Network Corp and Walt Disney Co announced a landmark deal that will allow the No. 2 satellite TV provider to deliver Disney-owned network content online, outside of a traditional TV subscription. Verizon’s goal “is to work with the content providers,” said McAdam at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference. “I have personally had discussions with the CEOs of the large content companies, and we would love to partner with them to see how we can take FiOS contact mobilely across the country.” he said. McAdam said the company could also look at providing a service delivered over wireless airwaves and not just broadband. According to PwC’s annual entertainment and media forecast, North American consumers will spend $6 billion in 2014 on entertainment from services such as Netflix that are offered over the top, meaning they are utilized over a network but not offered by the network operator. “I think you can actually get a virtuous cycle where broadcast viewing goes up and over-the-top viewing goes up, if you time this properly,” McAdam said. In January, Verizon acquired Intel Corp’s OnCue service for an undisclosed sum to accelerate its push into next-generation video services, including integrating it with Verizon’s FiOS fiber-based Internet and TV service that has more than 5 million video subscribers, about 5 percent of pay TV households. The company said it was open to providing over-the-top content to any device. McAdam also stressed that Verizon expects Netflix to pay for faster video delivery as part of a so-called interconnect deal, in an arrangement similar to the one the video provider has made with Comcast Corp. “I have spoken live and via email with (Netflix CEO) Reed Hastings, and I believe that we will get some sort of an arrangement with them as well,” said McAdam.

660,VZ,"DEALTALK-Softbank CEO's merger plans for Sprint, T-Mobile face long odds","By Nicola Leske NEW YORK, March 5 (Reuters) - Masayoshi Son isn’t used to taking no for an answer. But the Softbank Corp chief’s pleas for a merger of the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless carriers seem to be falling on deaf ears. It is no secret that Son, known to have threatened self-immolation to get his way in the past, wants to combine Sprint Corp, which Softbank acquired last year, with T-Mobile US Inc as part of his vision to create a global industry leader. Son plans to lay out his broader vision for the U.S. wireless communications industry at the Chamber of Commerce in Washington, D.C. next Tuesday. Speculation is rife that he will talk about a bid for T-Mobile, although a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday that was not the plan. Anticipation about a merger has already pushed up shares of Sprint and T-Mobile 15.6 percent and 18.3 percent, respectively, since Dec. 13, when media reports first emerged about Softbank’s interest in pursuing a deal as soon as the first half of 2014. Three sources familiar with the undertakings of the companies involved spoke on condition of anonymity for this article because they are not authorized to speak publicly about them. Son’s advisors are telling him to cool his heels for the time being, given the low odds of gaining antitrust approval, after they met lawmakers and regulators over the past several weeks in Washington and consulted with T-Mobile’s parent company, Deutsche Telekom. Son, who has eyed T-Mobile for years, would rather move sooner than later, before T-Mobile gets stronger and more expensive. He reiterated his interest in a deal just last week at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, according to the people familiar with the matter. “Everyone wants to do this deal; Sprint does, DT does, Softbank does, the investors want it, the customers want it; only the regulators don’t want it,” one of the sources said. Whether customers actually want or would benefit from a merger is debatable. Some consumer advocacy groups have warned it could result in higher prices, job losses and fewer choices for consumers. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler also expressed his skepticism about a potential merger in meetings with Son and Sprint Chief Executive Dan Hesse on Feb. 3, according to an FCC official briefed on the matter. His viewpoint echoed earlier comments from William Baer, assistant attorney general for the antitrust division of the U.S. Department of Justice. Baer, at a meeting of the New York State Bar Association on Jan. 30, gave long odds to a regulatory approval of mergers between any two of the top four wireless phone companies. U.S. regulators previously rejected AT&T; Inc’s $39 billion takeover bid for T-Mobile US in 2011. They have since argued that T-Mobile US has grown stronger, proving that the market can sustain four companies. Additionally, the FCC is under pressure to maximize revenue from a spectrum auction scheduled for mid-2015. Proceeds from the auction will be used to compensate broadcasters and to contribute toward the building of a $7 billion national public safety communications network. For the auction, TV stations will voluntarily relinquish their low-frequency airwaves but their willingness to sell depends on the prices they can get, a reason for regulators to seek as many bidders as possible. Such airwaves can cover greater distances and penetrate walls and buildings more easily than high frequency spectrum, which makes them highly coveted, especially by wireless carriers Sprint and T-Mobile, which have less low-frequency spectrum than AT&T; and Verizon Communications Inc. Deutsche Telekom would like to sell T-Mobile because it sees its fourth position in the United States, behind Verizon, AT&T; and Sprint, as limiting long-term profitability. It does not want a repeat performance of its failed attempt to sell the unit to AT&T.; Deutsche Telekom’s new CEO Timotheus Hoettges was a key negotiator in that deal and knows the risks and costs involved in a failure better than anyone. He negotiated a breakup fee of cash and spectrum that amounted to $6 billion, but the company had to contend with an exodus of customers amid the uncertainty of waiting for regulatory approval that in the end never came. To be sure, Son, who once threatened to set himself on fire as he pushed Japanese regulators to let him set up a high speed Internet service, has shown he does not give up easily. That is why people close to Son still have not ruled out the possibility he will try a merger anyway this year. One of the sources, who has worked with Son, said he is learning how U.S. politics work and is still working on making his case despite the odds. “He’s learning to deal with politics,” the person said. “His English is good but it’s not nuanced so he says exactly what he thinks and that can be challenging in D.C. politics,” the person added. Softbank’s arguments are that a combination of the third and fourth mobile operators would create a strong competitor to AT&T; and Verizon, the industry leaders. Looking outside the United States, Son can point to Britain and Australia as well as his home turf of Japan where regulators approved mergers between third- and fourth-ranking mobile players. Son has also argued that to build the super-fast network he envisions for the United States, it would only be economically viable were it to serve a larger subscriber base. Representatives for Softbank and Sprint have declined to comment on any potential deal with T-Mobile.",3052014,http://www.reuters.com/article/softbank-son-sprint-tmobile/dealtalk-softbank-ceos-merger-plans-for-sprint-t-mobile-face-long-odds-idUSL1N0M21UX20140305
661,VZ,U.S. extends Terremark contract as HealthCare.gov host,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration said on Friday Verizon Communications Inc’s Terremark unit will remain under contract as host of the federal website HealthCare.gov to better ensure a smooth end to Obamacare’s open enrollment period on March 31. Terremark’s contract with the Department of Health and Human Services was due to expire on March 30, the day before the end of open enrollment for 2014, a time when high daily volumes are expected as consumers from 36 states rush to use to website to sign up for subsidized private health insurance. It would be extended for up to seven months, according to federal documents. Hewlett-Packard Co has been named to replace Terremark as website host and operator of the department’s federal data center as part of Obama’s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. “We extended Terremark’s contract term in order to ensure a successful transition between the two contractors,” said a statement issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Obamacare agency at HHS. “HP and Terremark will work together so that the site runs smoothly for consumers during the remaining weeks of open enrollment,” the statement said. Terremark’s replacement by HP came to light after the botched October 1 rollout of HealthCare.gov. The website was overwhelmed by technical problems for much of October and November. Terremark’s data center also experienced outages across the system that affected not only HealthCare.gov but also 14 healthcare exchanges run by individual states. However, CMS had awarded the contract to HP several months before the launch. The administration mounted an emergency operation to fix the site that has allowed enrollment to proceed relatively smoothly since early December. More than 4 million people have signed up for private health coverage through the federal and state marketplaces. Terremark received $55.4 million under the original Obamacare marketplace contract, which was awarded in 2011.

665,VZ,SoftBank CEO says still keen to merge U.S. Sprint and T-Mobile,"March 11 (Reuters) - Japan’s SoftBank Corp is still trying to buy T-Mobile US Inc and merge it with its U.S. wireless carrier Sprint Corp, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son said, even though U.S. regulators appear set against a deal. Son told U.S. TV show host Charlie Rose in an interview that if the deal goes through, he would launch a price war to break what he called a duopoly by dominant U.S. carriers AT&T; Inc  and Verizon Communications Inc. “We would like to make the deal happen, but there are steps and details that we have to work out,” said Son, who had previously declined to comment on whether Softbank was in talks to buy T-Mobile. “We have to give it a shot.” Excerpts of the interview with the PBS network show were posted on YouTube. The show is scheduled to be broadcast late on Monday in the United States. The possibility of a merger between T-Mobile and Sprint, which was acquired by Softbank last year, was given the cold shoulder by regulators, with Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler expressing scepticism in meetings with Son and Sprint Chief Executive Dan Hesse on Feb. 3, according to an FCC official briefed on the matter. Regulators are concerned that reducing the number of major wireless carriers to three from four would hinder competition, but Son has argued that competition would be more robust if a  third strong player is created through the merger of smaller firms Sprint and T-Mobile. Softbank is now focused on convincing the parties involved with the merits of a merger, a senior company executive said, adding that any moves towards pursuing a deal were now on hold. The official declined to be named because he was not authorised to speak about the matter publicly. Son plans to present his vision for the U.S. wireless communications industry in a speech in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, although a person familiar with the matter said he would not talk about a bid for T-Mobile.",3112014,http://www.reuters.com/article/softbank-son-tmobile/softbank-ceo-says-still-keen-to-merge-u-s-sprint-and-t-mobile-idUSL3N0M81B820140311
666,VZ,UPDATE 2-Target says it declined to act on early alert of cyber breach,"By Jim Finkle and Susan Heavey BOSTON/WASHINGTON, March 13 (Reuters) - Target Corp’s  security software detected potentially malicious activity during last year’s massive data breach, but its staff decided not to take immediate action, the No. 3. U.S. retailer said on Thursday. “With the benefit of hindsight, we are investigating whether if different judgments had been made the outcome may have been different,” company spokeswoman Molly Snyder said in a statement. The disclosure came after Bloomberg Businessweek reported on Thursday that Target’s security team in Bangalore had received alerts from a FireEye Inc security system on Nov. 30 after the attack was launched and sent them to Target headquarters in Minneapolis. The FireEye reports indicated malicious software had appeared in the system, according to a person whom Bloomberg Businessweek had consulted on Target’s investigation but was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. The alert from FireEye labeled the threat with the generic name “malware.binary,” according to Bloomberg Businessweek. Two security experts who advise organizations in responding to cyber attacks and both have experience using FireEye technology said that security personnel typically don’t get excited about such generic alerts because FireEye does not provide much information about those threats. The experts said that they believed it was likely that Target’s security team received hundreds of such alerts on a daily basis, which would have made it tough to have singled out that threat as being particularly malicious. “They are bombarded with alerts. They get so many that they just don’t respond to everything,” said Shane Shook, an executive with Cylance Inc. “It is completely understandable how this happened.” John Strand, owner of Black Hills Information Security, said that it was easy to paint Target as being incompetent, given the severity of the breach, but that it was not fair to do so. “Target is a huge organization. They probably get hundreds of these alerts a day,” he said. “We can always look for someone to blame. Sometimes it just doesn’t work that way.” Target Chief Financial Officer John Mulligan told a congressional committee in February that the company only began investigating after on Dec. 12, when the U.S. Justice Department warned the company about suspicious activity involving payment cards. Within three days, nearly all the malicious software had been removed from Target’s cash registers, he said. FOLLOW-UP DIDN’T SEEM WARRANTED “Through our investigation, we learned that after these criminals entered our network, a small amount of their activity was logged and surfaced to our team. That activity was evaluated and acted upon,” Snyder said. “Based on their interpretation and evaluation of that activity, the team determined that it did not warrant immediate follow up.” Target shares fell 2 percent to $59.86 in late afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange after the company released the statement. Some 40 million payment card records were stolen from the retailer, along with 70 million other records with customer information such as addresses and telephone numbers. Congress is investigating the breach along with lapses at other retailers, and credit card companies were pushing for better security. Target also faces dozens of potential class-action lawsuits and action from banks that could seek reimbursement for millions of dollars in losses due to fraud and the cost of card replacements. A spokesman for FireEye declined to comment. FireEye  shares were up 1.8 percent at $79.05 on Nasdaq. Representatives for the U.S. Secret Service and Verizon Communications Inc, which are investigating Target’s breach, declined to comment. FireEye has a function that automatically deletes malicious software, but it had been turned off by Target’s security team before the hackers’ attack, the Bloomberg report said, citing two people who audited FireEye’s role after the breach. Shook and Strand said that the vast majority of FireEye’s customers turn off that functionality because it is known for incorrectly flagging data as malware, which can halt email and Web traffic for business users. “FireEye ... is cutting edge,” Strand said. “But it takes love and care and feeding. You have to watch it and monitor it.” ",3132014,http://www.reuters.com/article/target-breach/update-2-target-says-it-declined-to-act-on-early-alert-of-cyber-breach-idUSL2N0MA1MW20140313
667,VZ,Sally Beauty says card data may have been taken in breach,"March 17 (Reuters) - Beauty products retailer and distributor Sally Beauty Holdings Inc said “fewer than 25,000” credit-card records may have been taken in a recent data breach. The company said on March 5 it discovered that its network had been hacked but added no card or customer data appeared to have been stolen. Sally Beauty said on Monday that an investigation by forensics firm Verizon had discovered the evidence that card payment data may have been removed. “As experience has shown in prior data security incidents at other companies, it is difficult to ascertain with certainty the scope of a data security breach/incident prior to the completion of a comprehensive forensic investigation,” Sally Beauty said. “As a result, we will not speculate as to the scope or nature of the data security incident,” the company added. Hacking has become a major concern for retailers in the United States. Target Corp said in December that some 40 million payment card records were stolen along with 70 million other customer records during a cyber attack over the holiday shopping season. Target said last week that the security breach could have been more extensive than reported. The biggest credit card breach at a U.S. retailer reported to date was an attack against TJX Cos, the parent of TJ Maxx and Marshalls in 2007. The company disclosed that data from 45.7 million payment cards had been stolen by hackers over 18 months.",3172014,http://www.reuters.com/article/sally-beauty-dataprotection/sally-beauty-says-card-data-may-have-been-taken-in-breach-idUSL3N0ME2M820140317
668,VZ,TIMELINE-Ono deal extends Vodafone's spending spree,"March 17 (Reuters) - Vodafone Group Plc agreed to buy Spain’s largest cable operator Ono for 7.2 billion euros ($10 billion) in the latest move by the British group to expand its European operations with a broadband offering. Having reaped a $130 billion windfall by selling its stake in Verizon Wireless to its partner Verizon Communications Inc , Vodafone was left with an acquisition war chest of as much as $40 billion even after distributing the majority of the sale proceeds to shareholders and investing billions in its network. Following is a chronology of key recent events involving Vodafone: * Feb 13 - Vodafone and Bharti Airtel buy Indian airwaves worth about $3 billion each in a hotly contested auction. * Feb 10 - Vodafone chief Vittorio Colao says group could have the capacity to spend between $30 billion and $40 billion on acquisitions in coming years and no deal should be too big if it makes strategic sense. He tells reporters he is exploring possibilities for a potential shopping spree on big acquisitions on top of investments in Vodafone’s existing business. * Feb 6 - Vodafone wins Indian cabinet’s approval for $1.6 billion deal to buy out minority partners in its unit in the country. * Jan 27 - AT&T; rules out bid for Vodafone after Britain’s takeover watchdog asks it to clarify its position following reports it had sounded out European regulators on prospects of a merger. AT&T;’s statement means it cannot make an offer for Vodafone for at least six months, unless the British company invites it to do so or a third party enters the fray. * Nov 12 - Vodafone says it will spend 7 billion pounds to increase the speed and coverage of its networks and reverse a record fall in revenue resulting from its struggling European business. Says it will spend 3 billion pounds in Europe, 1.5 billion in  emerging markets and the rest on fixed-line assets, enterprise and its retail arm. * Sept 2 - Verizon agrees to pay $130 billion to buy Vodafone out of its U.S. wireless business, allowing the UK group to return 71 percent of the net proceeds - or $84 billion - to shareholders while also ramping up investment in its networks. * June 24 - Vodafone agrees to buy Germany’s largest cable operator Kabel Deutschland for 7.7 billion euros, adding TV and fixed-line services to help defend against mounting competition in its most important market. * March 13 - Vodafone and Orange to invest up to 1 billion euros in a joint fibre optic network in Spain that will bring superfast Internet to millions of homes. * Vodafone buys Cable & Wireless Worldwide (CWW) for $1.6 billion, giving it a fixed-line network in Britain.

669,VZ,Numericable and Altice to market EUR10bn-equiv. bond from Monday,"* Bond backing SFR buy to roadshow next week * Details emerge on maturities and pricing * Deal dubbed “High-yield’s Verizon” By Robert Smith LONDON, April 11 (IFR) - Numericable and Altice will start marketing a huge 10bn-equivalent high-yield bond package backing the acquisition of SFR on Monday, according to a banker close to the deal. On Saturday Numericable emerged victorious after a long bidding war with Bouygues for French telecom unit SFR, which Vivendi is disposing of. Numericable announced the 6.55bn loan component of the deal on Wednesday and has been meeting loan investors throughout this week. On Monday it will begin meeting bond investors to market 6.04bn-equivalent of bonds at the Numericable operating company level and 4.15bn-equivalent of bonds at the Altice holding company level. The tranches will be split into euro and dollars. JP Morgan is left-lead on the opco bond and Goldman Sachs left-lead on the holdco bond. Maturities have not been formally announced and are subject to change, but most of the debt will be for eight-years. The opco bond should have five-year, eight-year and 10-year maturities, according to the banker, while the holdco issue should be solely eight-years. HIGH-YIELD’S VERIZON The deal’s size is virtually unprecedented in the European high-yield market, and will rapidly eclipse Wind Telecom’s 3.75bn-equivalent deal on Tuesday, the previous largest European high-yield bond of 2014. Still, demand is expected to be fierce. “Loads of people are already putting in orders for the deal and it’s not even been formally announced yet,” said the banker. “This could be the Verizon of the high-yield market.” Much like Verizon’s US$49bn investment grade bond priced last year, market sources expect Numericable and Altice will have to pay up to clear such a large amount of paper. “Most people are pegging it at a low 6% yield for the opco and low 8% yield for the holdco,” said a high-yield investor. “The opco could come inside 5% but I don’t think it will. They need to pay us to clear so many billions of bonds in one go.” Pricing on the holdco bond is complicated by the fact that it not only sits above Numericable but also sits above Altice VII. Altice VII is the entity that has raised debt financing over the past year and contains its cable businesses in Israel, Portugal, and the French Overseas Territories among others. The banker said that, as a result, there are a range of opinions on price and no one is sure quite where final pricing will end up. “Wind’s deal this week is probably the best comp, and no one expected that to come as tight as 7%,” he added. The investor argued that as the Altice holdco sits above a lot of existing debt with the ability to trap cash, then it would have made more sense to issue a PIK toggle. PIK toggles are a variation on payment-in-kind notes, which pay coupons in cash if the issuer can, while leaving it the option of allowing interest to accrue on the principal if it cannot. “A PIK toggle would have given the company more flexibility, but it’s not needed as they are very comfortable on being able to pay cash,” said the banker. “A 4bn PIK toggle would be a very difficult deal to sell to investors anyway.” German vehicle parts supplier Schaeffler issued the largest publicly placed PIK toggle last year, and at 1.5bn-equivalent this was not even half size of the Altice holdco bond. The Altice Group is a multinational cable and telecommunications company with a presence in France, Israel, Belgium & Luxembourg, Portugal, French Overseas Territories and Switzerland.

670,VZ,UPDATE 1-Numericable and Altice announce 10bn-equivalent bond package,"* Deal dubbed “high-yield’s Verizon” * Altice bond uses complex holdco structure * Bonds to price after Easter break, demand expected to be strong   (Adds quotes, background) By Robert Smith LONDON, April 14 (IFR) - Numericable and Altice will test the limits of the high-yield bond market later this month with a 10bn-equivalent bond financing for their acquisition of French telecom unit SFR from Vivendi. The jumbo bond package, which has been dubbed “the Verizon of the high-yield market”, will be split into 6.04bn-equivalent of bonds at the Numericable operating company level, and 4.15bn-equivalent of bonds at the Altice holding company level. Both will be split into euro and dollar tranches. These kind of sizes tend to be seen in the investment-grade market, which has shown great depth for M&A; financing in the past, but they are far less common in high-yield. As IFR reported on Friday, the Numericable bond is split into five-, eight- and 10-year tranches, while the Altice bond is solely eight-year debt. The Numericable bonds are senior secured first lien notes, split into five-year non-call two, eight-year non-call three and 10-year non-call five tranches. The five-year bond will have 500m and US$920m tranches, while the eight- and 10-year bonds will both be split into 1bn and US$2bn tranches. The Altice bonds are eight-year non-call three senior notes, but the dollar and euro split is yet to be determined. Despite its large size, demand for the deal is expected to be fierce. A banker close to the trade said on Friday that many investors were already putting in orders, even though the bond had not yet been officially announced. “People are already saying this could be the Verizon of the high-yield market,” he added. Verizon made history in September 2013 with a record-breaking US$49bn deal that received more than US$100bn of orders. The liquidity in the European high-yield market is deepening, with European high-yield bond funds seeing an unbroken streak of weekly inflows for the past seven months, according to JP Morgan data. Italy’s Wind Telecom 3.75bn-equivalent senior bond deal that priced last week is testament to this much improved liquidity, with one banker saying that orders for the 1.75bn euro tranche alone topped 10bn. The deal’s complex structure will require intense credit work for potential investors, however. Numericable’s bond offering memorandum is more than 650 pages long, while the Altice offering memorandum runs to nearly double that at more than 1,100 pages. The Altice holdco bond is particularly complex, as it not only sits above the new Numericable-SFR business but also Altice International, which has operations in far-flung geographies such as Israel and the Dominican Republic. The Numericable-SFR business will have net debt of 11.7bn-equivalent, while Altice International has net debt of 3.5bn-equivalent. Investors will have to be confident that there will be enough cash left over after servicing this debt to pay the coupons on the new 4.15bn-equivalent debt at the holdco level. Altice estimates that the holdco will incur cash interest  expenses of 325m, but that 967m of cash from Numericable-SFR and Altice International will be left over to service this. Investor meetings start today in London, with a lunch hosted by Altice’s founder Patrick Drahi. Altice’s CEO Dexter Goei and its CFO Dennis Okhuijsen will also be in attendance, as will Numericable’s CEO Eric Denoyer and its CFO Thierry Lemaitre. A second meeting in London will follow on Tuesday morning, before the roadshow moves to the United States from Tuesday to Thursday. A final day of meetings will be held after the Easter break on April 22 in Paris and Frankfurt, with pricing of the deal expected on April 23. JP Morgan is lead-left bookrunner on the Numericable opco bond, while Goldman Sachs is lead-left on the Altice holdco bond. The pair are global coordinators on both tranches, along with Deutsche Bank. Deutsche Bank is left-lead on the EUR6.55bn-equivalent loan component on the deal.

671,VZ,"U.S. regulator reasserts goal to restrict AT&T;, Verizon in auction","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. telecommunications regulator on Thursday reasserted his commitment to helping smaller national wireless carriers get access to valuable lower-frequency airwaves in the upcoming spectrum auction. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler, in a letter to Representative John Barrow, reaffirmed his plans to restrict how much spectrum the biggest U.S. carriers, Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T; Inc, could buy in the auction scheduled for mid-2015. “The Incentive Auction offers the opportunity, possibly the last for years to come, to make low-band spectrum available to any mobile wireless provider, in any market, that is willing and able to compete at auction,” Wheeler wrote to Barrow. “At the same time, a priority of the auction should be to assure that companies that already possess low-band spectrum do not exploit the auction to keep competitors from accessing the spectrum necessary to provide competition,” he also wrote. Wheeler’s letter comes a day after AT&T;, the No. 2 wireless provider, threatened to sit out the auction altogether over the regulator’s proposed restrictions. Wheeler’s plan would reserve part of the spectrum, up to 30 megahertz, in each market for bidding only by carriers that control less than one-third of low-frequency airwaves there. The reserve would kick in only after the auction reaches a particular trigger, which will be established in coming months, according to people briefed on the proposal. The plan is expected to be formally circulated at the FCC later this month and voted on at the May 15 public meeting. The rules would benefit the No. 3 and No. 4 nation-wide carriers Sprint Corp and T-Mobile USA as they would largely restrict Verizon and AT&T;, which Wheeler said control some two-thirds of those frequencies across the country. In the letter, Wheeler argued that the smaller national carriers need a boost in getting low-band spectrum to provide more and better rural coverage, and to correct what he called “the historical accident of previous spectrum assignments.” Critics have argued that Sprint and T-Mobile both had a chance to acquire more low-band spectrum in the past but for various reasons chose not to  so. They also say that restricting the biggest providers amounts to regulators picking winners and losers. AT&T;, in a filing disclosed on Wednesday, expressed concerns that having 30 MHz of spectrum out of bounds for some carriers may mean that in some markets, only one restricted bidder - presumably either AT&T; or Verizon - would have an opportunity to buy a block of airwaves large enough to deploy LTE technology. “Such restrictions would put AT&T; in an untenable position, forcing AT&T; to reevaluate its potential participation in the auction,” Joan Marsh, AT&T;’s vice president of federal regulator, said in the filing. Though AT&T;’s threat of auction boycott on Wednesday was seen by some observers as a bluff, lack of the carrier’s participation could put a squeeze on how much cash the FCC raises in the sale of airwaves. Congress has required the FCC to raise enough money to pay back TV stations for giving up the airwaves that will be sold in the auction and fund a new $7 billion public safety network. “Companies are free to advocate the views that are in their best interest, but the public interest is not measured against the business model of one or two companies; it is measured against the ability of the market to deliver the benefits of competition to Americans in urban, suburban and rural America alike,” an FCC official said on Thursday. Wheeler’s letter was in response to one on Monday from Barrow, a Democrat from Georgia, and 77 other lawmakers in the House that encouraged the FCC as it prepares for the auction.

Sprint’s parent company has been exploring a possible tie-up with T-Mobile, although  no proposal has been announced. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler has proposed restrictions on how much the biggest carriers, Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T; Inc, could bid in the major auction of television spectrum scheduled for mid-2015. The auction offers carriers a chance to buy access to airwaves that are valued for their strength and reach. Wheeler’s proposal has yet to be formally circulated among other FCC commissioners but would reserve up to 30 megahertz of spectrum in each market for carriers who do not already dominate the lower frequencies there - in most cases, Verizon and AT&T.; However, as in many other proceedings, the FCC’s rules would be based on the “current market structure.” Any changes or proposed changes in that structure that could undermine the goals of the auction would prompt a review and potential edits, said sources briefed on the proposed rules. That means if Japan’s SoftBank Corp, Sprint’s parent company, forges ahead with its goal of merging the No. 3 wireless carrier with No. 4 provider T-Mobile, the FCC could eliminate the reserve set off for smaller competitors, sources said. Some regulators, including Wheeler, have been skeptical of a potential merger because it would reduce the number of major U.S. wireless carriers to three from four. SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son has argued that a stronger third player would create more competition for AT&T; and Verizon. FCC commissioners will review the draft rules in coming weeks and are expected to propose them on May 15. Bigger competitors have pushed back against bidding restrictions and AT&T; on Wednesday threatened to boycott the auction if the rules are adopted as proposed. U.S. regulators have expressed skepticism about the proposed Sprint/T-Mobile deal, but SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son has made no secret of his goal to acquire the smaller carrier to become a stronger force in the United States and ultimately build the world’s biggest mobile-related corporation. It is unclear how active Sprint plans to be in the 2015 auction, particularly if the FCC were to reconsider how it may calculate Sprint’s spectrum holdings in evaluating any new spectrum acquisitions. The FCC reviews purchases of airwaves if the buyer acquires more than one-third of spectrum deemed suitable for wireless service in that area. In the past, large chunks of Sprint’s higher-frequency airwaves were considered unfit for wireless. The proposed changes would expand the scope of what spectrum is deemed fit for wireless, affecting particularly the holdings of Sprint and satellite provider Dish Network Corp. Some analysts have said the expanded “spectrum screen” may force Sprint to divest some of its airwaves if it merges with T-Mobile or buys a lot in the auction. However, that “spectrum screen” is flexible and does not mean the FCC would necessarily reject any deals that exceed the one-third threshold. And supporters of the merger have argued that if the FCC determines the Sprint-T-Mobile deal is in the public interest, the agency would be unlikely to force divestitures of the very spectrum that would make the merged company a stronger competitor to AT&T; and Verizon. Sprint closed at $8.52 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, up 1.8 percent. T-Mobile closed at $30.40, up 2.2 percent.

677,VZ,"Espionage hacking grows, with more from east Europe - Verizon study","SAN FRANCISCO, April 22 (Reuters) - Hacking for espionage purposes is sharply increasing, with groups or national governments from Eastern Europe playing a growing role, according to one of the most comprehensive annual studies of computer intrusions. Spying intrusions traced back to any country in 2013 were blamed on residents of China and other East Asian nations 49 percent of the time, but Eastern European countries, especially Russian-speaking nations, were the suspected launching site for 21 percent of breaches, Verizon Communications Inc’s said in its annual Data Breach Investigations Report. Those were by far the most active areas detected in the sampling, which drew more than half of its data from victims in the United States. About 25 percent of spying incidents could not be attributed to attackers from any country, according to the authors of the report. Though the overall number of spying incidents studied tripled to 511 from total in the 2013 Verizon report, most of that increase is due to the addition of new data sources. Even looking at just the same contributors as before, however, espionage cases grew, said Verizon investigator Bryan Sartin. Not all electronic spying was blamed on governments. Investigators from Verizon, Intel Corp’s McAfee, Kaspersky Labs and other private companies and public agencies contributing data ascribed 11 percent of espionage attacks to organized criminals and 87 percent to governments. In some cases, the criminal gangs were probably looking to sell what they found to governments or competitors of the victims. “We do see a slight merging between the classic organized criminal and the espionage crook,” Sartin said, adding that he expected that trend to continue. If the rise of detected Eastern European spying comes as a surprise to those mainly familiar with accusations against China, a bigger surprise might be the study’s findings about attacks on retailers. Though recent breaches at Target Corp and other retailers through their point-of-sale equipment have dominated the headlines and prompted congressional hearings in the past few months, fewer such intrusions have been reported to the Verizon team than in past years, even as the number of report contributors has multiplied. “The media frenzy makes quite a splash, but from a frequency standpoint, this largely remains a small-and-medium business issue,” the study says. The report will be released to the public on Wednesday.

678,VZ,UPDATE 3-U.S. regulators to propose new net neutrality rules in May,"(Adds order will not address interconnection deals, details of court ruling) By Alina Selyukh WASHINGTON, April 23 (Reuters) - U.S. regulators are expected to vote on May 15 on a new set of so-called “net neutrality” rules aimed at making certain that broadband providers do not slow down or block consumers’ access to legal Internet content. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler on Wednesday said he plans to circulate his proposed rules among other commissioners on Thursday, teeing them up for a vote at the FCC’s May 15 meeting. The draft rules will then be formally proposed and available for public comment. The rules are expected to ensure that network operators disclose exactly how they manage Internet traffic and do not restrict consumers as they surf the Web. Wheeler has also said he planned to take a case-by-case approach to reviewing the practices adopted by Internet providers. However, the rules are not expected to address the issue of interconnection, or agreements in which content companies pay network providers for faster access to their sites or services. That issue was recently brought into the spotlight by a tussle between video streaming service Netflix Inc and cable company Comcast Corp. Wheeler in the past has reaffirmed that net neutrality rules would not regulate deals between businesses on connections before they reach the user as the scope of the rules is limited to the last leg of the network that reaches the consumer. Virtually all large Internet service providers, such as Verizon Communications Inc and Time Warner Cable Inc , have pledged to abide by the principles of open Internet reinforced by these rules. But critics have raised concerns that, without a formal rule, the voluntary pledges could be pulled back over time and also leave the door open for deals that would give unequal treatment to websites or services. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in January for the second time struck down the FCC’s previous version of the open Internet order. However, the court did affirm that the FCC had authority to regulate broadband, giving the agency new legal opportunity to bring back non-discrimination and no-blocking regulations for Internet service providers. Comcast, through conditions placed on its 2011 merger with NBC Universal, is the only Internet provider still bound by the earlier FCC net neutrality rules through 2018. Comcast has now proposed to buy its biggest rival Time Warner Cable Inc and Netflix has come out in opposition of the $45.2 billion merger, arguing that the Internet provider should be banned from charging fees for delivering its content. Comcast has said that Netflix’s opposition was “based on inaccurate claims and arguments.” Netflix, which accounts for much of Internet traffic during peak hours, in February struck a deal to pay Comcast for faster online delivery of its movies and TV shows. Some companies pay Internet service providers or other firms that serve as intermediaries to better deliver traffic to users.

679,VZ,US STOCKS-Apple buoys Nasdaq; Ukraine weighs on broader market,"* Apple rallies a day after announcing 7-for-1 stock split * Caterpillar gains after results; Verizon, 3M fall * Dow flat; S&P; 500 up 0.2 pct; Nasdaq up 0.5 pct   (Updates to close; adds Microsoft and Amazon gains on earnings after the bell) By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, April 24 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq rose modestly in a choppy session on Thursday, lifted by a rally in Apple shares a day after the iPad maker’s strong results, though tensions in Ukraine held the broader market in check. Shares of Apple Inc, the most valuable U.S. company by market capitalization, jumped 8.2 percent to $567.77, the  biggest gain since August, a day after the company posted revenue that far outpaced expectations. Apple also approved another $30 billion stock-buyback plan, raised its dividend and authorized a seven-for-one stock split. The S&P; information technology index rose 1.1 percent and was the best-performing sector of the day. The three major U.S. stock indexes had opened sharply higher, with the Nasdaq initially climbing more than 1 percent before turning negative in the first half-hour of trading. Wall Street bounced off session lows with gains again concentrated in the Nasdaq, but stocks finished the day well off earlier highs. Much of the volatility was driven by comments from Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, who said Russia started military drills near the border with Ukraine. Ukrainian forces killed up to five pro-Moscow rebels as they closed in on the separatists’ military stronghold in the east. “The market is biased - from all of the good news we’ve heard on stocks recently - to go higher,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. “However, there are hot spots in the world that keep flaring up like a campfire that won’t go out, and the market needs to deal with that.” Caterpillar Inc rose 1.8 percent to $105.28 after the company reported better-than-expected earnings and raised its full-year profit outlook. Limiting the Dow’s advance were Verizon Communications Inc  and 3M Co, whose shares fell after the companies’ results missed expectations. Verizon dropped 2.4 percent to $46.28, while 3M fell 1 percent to $136.65. The S&P; telecom index lost 1.7 percent. The index has dropped 3.8 percent over the past two days, its worst two-session performance since June. The Dow Jones industrial average remained unchanged to close at 16,501.65. The S&P; 500 gained 3.22 points or 0.17 percent, to 1,878.61. The Nasdaq Composite added 21.372 points or 0.52 percent, to end at 4,148.338. After the close, Microsoft Corp shares rose 2.4 percent to $40.40 after the world’s largest software company posted third-quarter results. Amazon.com Inc advanced 0.5 percent to $338.89 in extended-hours trading after the online retailer reported a 32 percent jump in first-quarter net income and a 23 percent rise in revenue. Facebook Inc reported a 72 percent jump in first-quarter revenue, lifted by its mobile advertising business, after the closing bell on Wednesday. The stock darted between positive and negative territory during the session before closing down 0.8 percent at $60.87. Profits are seen rising 2.9 percent this quarter, down from the 6.5 percent growth rate estimated at the start of the year, but above the low of 0.6 percent seen last week, according to Thomson Reuters data. Zimmer Holdings Inc agreed to buy Biomet Inc  in a deal valued at about $13.35 billion to broaden its portfolio of products that treat bone and joint-related disorders. Zimmer’s stock surged 11.5 percent to $101.97. A number of cloud-computing stocks, which have struggled lately but rose last week, opened higher and then quickly sold off. Workday Inc slid 5.3 percent to $72.59 while Salesforce.com fell 1.6 percent to $54.73. Volume was light, with about 6.07 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.59 billion average so far this month, according to data from BATS Global Markets. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones on the New York Stock Exchange by 1,535 to 1,465, while on the Nasdaq, decliners beat advancers by 1,494 to 1,087.

680,VZ,UPDATE 2-FCC pushes back against criticism over Internet traffic plan,"(Recasts throughout with additional details of FCC proposal) By Alina Selyukh NEW YORK, April 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. communications regulator on Thursday sought to tame an outcry over its plan to allow “fast lanes” for some content on the Internet, insisting that the agency will monitor and punish broadband providers that treat Web traffic “unreasonably.” The Federal Communications Commission is weighing rules that would ban Internet providers from blocking access to websites or applications, but would allow content companies to pay for faster Internet speeds delivering their traffic as long as such deals are deemed “commercially reasonable.” Consumer advocates assailed the proposal from FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, saying it would let certain content providers pay for access to fast lanes and discourage consumers from going to competitors’ sites where videos or other content may load more slowly by comparison. The five-member FCC will negotiate the rules before they vote on May 15 to formally propose them and seek public comment. “This move is likely to favor the companies with the deepest pockets and hurt the scrappy start-ups,” Delara Derakhshani, policy counsel for Consumers Union, said in a statement. The debate is over the principle known as open Internet or net neutrality, which establishes that owners of networks that deliver online content should treat all of that content equally. “There are reports that the FCC is gutting the Open Internet rule. They are flat-out wrong,” Wheeler said in a statement late on Wednesday. In a blog post on Thursday, he said the rules, which he intends to finalize by year-end, would not change the FCC’s “underlying goals of transparency” or harm consumers. The FCC for years has struggled to set rules that would prohibit Internet providers from restricting how consumers surf the Web but would also withstand legal challenges from broadband providers who have said they, as owners of the networks, should be able to manage them or charge for their use without what they see as regulatory overreach. In January, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for the second time struck down the FCC’s previous anti-discrimination and anti-blocking rules after a challenge from Verizon Communications Inc. But the judges did affirm the agency’s authority to regulate broadband, giving the FCC new legal opportunity to rewrite the rules. It was the court’s direction that guided Wheeler’s proposal to allow commercially reasonable preferential treatment of traffic, senior FCC officials said on Thursday. The agency will seek public comment before determining how to define “commercially unreasonable” behavior or a violation of “net neutrality,” but it will focus on whether broadband companies’ treatment of traffic hurts competitors or consumers, hurts free speech or is done in good faith, the officials said. The FCC would have the authority to go after companies that violate the commercially reasonable standard on a case-by-case basis. The review would be prompted by formal or informal complaints as well as the FCC’s own monitoring of how broadband providers treat online traffic, the officials said. One of the ideas the FCC is considering would be to have a commission ombudsperson to monitor the industry with consumers and content providers in mind, one FCC official said. In striking down the FCC’s old rules, the court said the agency had improperly treated Internet service providers as regulated public utilities providing telecommunications services, like telephone companies, while they were actually classified as information service providers. Consumer advocates have called on the FCC to reclassify Internet providers as more heavily regulated telecommunications services, an idea that has faced tremendous pushback from the broadband industry and Republican lawmakers who have urged the FCC to tread lightly. Virtually all large Internet providers, such as Verizon, AT&T; Inc and Time Warner Cable Inc, pledged after January’s ruling to continue abiding by the principles of open Internet and have not weighed in since then. The fees that content providers pay for faster access to their sites or applications recently grabbed the spotlight after video streaming service Netflix Inc struck a deal known as an interconnection agreement with cable provider Comcast Corp  in February. However, such deals are struck on the back end of the network that gets content from a server to the broadband network and so are outside of the scope of the FCC’s net neutrality rules. The rules have only applied to deals related to traffic going over the “last mile” of broadband networks, where content moves directly to the user.

681,VZ,"Verizon shies away from discounts, shares fall","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc’s (VZ.N) reluctance to offer mass discounts in a near-saturated mobile market is costing it new subscribers, analysts said on Thursday even as the largest U.S. wireless carrier beat Wall Street’s profit expectations. Shares of Verizon were down nearly 3 percent at midday on Thursday, making it the biggest percentage loser among Dow Jones industrial average .DJI component stocks. While its rivals have engaged in aggressive discounting, Verizon has been more conservative in price cuts in an attempt to preserve revenue per user at the expense of subscriber adds. “Verizon and AT&T; have solid networks but their price premium is so large that it is going to be very hard for everyone to have their cake and eat it too,” said Craig Moffett, a senior analyst at MoffettNathanson. “They will have to sacrifice growth or margin going forward and the market is coming to precisely that realization,” he said. The company has targeted its device installment plans and discounts at its high-data customers, prompting some low-end subscribers to switch carriers. “We’ve built our brand on a superior network. We are not going to be the low-cost provider in the marketplace,” Verizon’s chief financial officer, Fran Shammo, told Reuters. “Not every subscriber is equal,” he said. “We will take our time and respond where we need to respond. We will attack the quality base of customers that we are targeting.” The company’s wireless business added 539,000 postpaid subscribers in the quarter, 20 percent less than in the year-ago quarter, while No. 2 carrier AT&T; Inc (T.N) added 625,000 subscribers, blowing past Wall Street expectations. Analysts say that as the industry leader, Verizon is looking to maintain its premium price point as a sign of a superior product even at the expense of additional subscribers. “It is very easy in this industry to lower prices, but it is almost impossible to raise them,” said Roger Enter of Recon Analytics. “They are rightfully cautious about not jumping head-on into what could be a price war,” he said. Excluding unusual items, Verizon’s earnings per share of 91 cents beat Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S analyst expectations of 87 cents per share. The No. 1 U.S. mobile provider earned $5.98 billion in the first quarter, compared with $4.86 billion in the year-ago quarter. On the wireline side, it said it added 57,000 FiOS video customers and 98,000 net new FiOS Internet connections in the quarter. The company said wireless customer defections, known in the industry as churn, increased slightly from a year ago. Revenue rose 4.8 percent, the highest growth rate in five quarters, to $30.82 billion from $29.42 billion a year earlier. Wall Street expected $30.698 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Its February acquisition of Vodafone Group Plc’s (VOD.L) 45 percent share in their prior joint venture for $130 billion gave the company access to greater amounts of cash flow. Verizon shares were down 2.6 percent at $46.18 on the New York Stock Exchange at midday on Thursday.

It also approved another $30 billion stock buyback plan, raised its dividend and authorized a seven-for-one stock split. “People have been critical of the cash on Apple’s balance sheet, but now it has faced up to that criticism. It’s doing all the right things, and I don’t think a move over $600 would be out of place now,” said Michael Binger, senior portfolio manager at Gradient Investments LLC in Minneapolis, which owns Apple. Caterpillar Inc rose 2.5 percent to $106.01 after reporting better-than-expected earnings and raising its full-year profit view. On the downside, both Verizon Communications Inc and 3M Co fell after results missed expectations. Verizon dropped 1.7 percent to $46.60 and 3M fell 1.4 percent to $136.11. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 31.08 points, or 0.19 percent, at 16,470.57. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was down 1.87 points, or 0.10 percent, at 1,873.52. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 7.74 points, or 0.19 percent, at 4,119.23. Social media giant Facebook Inc posted a 72 percent jump in first-quarter revenue, lifted by its mobile advertising business.

688,VZ,Apple coming back for more,"(This story originally appeared on IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication) By Danielle Robinson NEW YORK, April 28 (IFR) - Apple is planning to hit the markets once again in the near future, to raise at least as much as the US$17bn it raised a year ago, but it is possible that giant asset managers could persuade it to double that amount and do a Verizon-style mega-deal that is generously priced. The company said on its earnings call in the past week that “we plan to be active in both the domestic and international bond markets during 2014 for an amount of term debt financing similar to what we issued in 2013”. Apple has just increased its authorised share buybacks by US$30bn, to US$90bn by the end of 2015. Like its US$17bn deal a year ago, it is keen to issue more debt as a way of leveraging its offshore cash balances. Already, some investors have calculated that Apple could add a further US$30bn-$40bn of debt to its balance sheet without hurting its Double A rating. “They are talking about doing another US$15bn or US$20bn, but we think they will do another US$15bn to US$20bn after that,” said Chuck Burge, senior portfolio manager overseeing US$15bn of assets under management at Invesco. Such a large overhang could be used by investors, along with the shareholder-friendly use of proceeds and the lacklustre performance of its original deal, to squeeze decent new-issue concessions out of a new dollar deal - or better still, convince the tech giant to just get all of its funding plans done in one hit. “Apple could use the Verizon deal as a model of how to structure this new transaction,” said Burge. “Verizon went to investors and started saying, we would like to do an M&A; deal of around US$20bn-$25bn, and then they got the idea that they could take care of all of their financing needs in one hit at a price that investors wanted.” Apple priced its first deal with little to no new-issue concession last April, only to see its longer-dated tranches plunge by more than eight points in price at one stage when then Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke first hinted in May at tapering the Fed’s QE bond buying programme. Total return investors’ bitter experience with the Apple deal was one of the reasons why Verizon needed to offer huge new-issue spread cushions, especially on the long-dated tranches of its record US$49bn offering in September. Now, the execution strategies of the Apple and Verizon deals stand in stark contrast to one another in the minds of investors. Apple squeezed on price and, apart from its short-dated tranches, its bonds have never really outperformed. Its 3.85% 2043s still trade below par at 89 and wider than the Treasuries 100bp new-issue spread - at plus 105bp. Verizon’s US$15bn 6.55% September 2043 tranche, on the other hand, was priced with a 90bp new-issue concession and reaped investors billions of dollars of profits immediately. It has been a stunning outperformer, currently trading at US$124.00 bid or 154bp over Treasuries, from a new-issue spread of 265bp. Apple could counter the overhang argument, at least, by insisting it will only issue a certain amount of term debt in US dollars this year. Moody’s has also just given Apple a P-1 commercial paper rating and expects it will issue up to US$10bn in CP. Moody’s also warned that if Apple borrowed “meaningfully more” than the incremental US$25bn that it needs to pay for share repurchases, then “that would be credit-negative and could pressure the long-term rating down”. The demand for high-grade bonds is also so immense, both in the US and in euros and sterling, that many think Apple will be able to issue in sizes and currencies that reap the best cost of funds. “There is just huge appetite for paper, so much so that a new deal would probably be done easily and at a very nice level for the company,” said Mirko Mikelic, senior portfolio manager for Fifth Third Bank’s ClearArc Capital. According to Michael Collins, senior portfolio manager at Prudential, demand technicals continue to reach new heights. “It feels like we are entering into a new phase of the credit cycle, where issuers are taking advantage of stable rates to increase leverage, underwriting standards have arguably gotten worse in some cases and investors are falling over themselves to get bonds,” Collins said.

691,VZ,Verizon to FCC: Restrictions on airwaves auction are unjust,"WASHINGTON, May 1 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc  has urged U.S. regulators not to restrict how much it can buy in next year’s auction of wireless spectrum, saying such a limit would subsidize the smallest national carriers and their foreign owners. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler recently proposed rules for the complex sale of valuable airwaves scheduled for mid-2015. The rules would reserve part of the spectrum in each market for wireless carriers that do not already have dominant blocks of low-frequency airwaves there. That would benefit the No. 3 and No. 4 carriers, Sprint Corp  and T-Mobile US Inc, by limiting the two biggest carriers, Verizon and AT&T; Inc, which dominate the highly valued low-band spectrum. The sale is considered one of the most complex undertakings by the FCC. It would first involve TV stations’ giving up airwaves they exclusively use and the FCC then auctioning them off to wireless carriers. Congress has mandated that the FCC raise enough money to pay broadcasters for their lost spectrum and fund a new $7 billion public safety network. Verizon on Monday pushed back against the proposed rules in meetings with Ajit Pai and Mike O’Rielly, the FCC’s two Republican commissioners, who have also expressed concerns about the proposed restrictions, according to an FCC disclosure  posted online on Thursday. AT&T; last month told Wheeler’s staff that it may choose to sit out the auction if such rules are adopted, though it later told investors that outcome would not be ideal. “Verizon stressed that it would be perverse and unjust for the commission to adopt auction rules that subsidize some large multinational companies at the expense of their competitors,” Verizon said in Thursday’s filing, referring to Sprint’s Japanese parent, SoftBank Corp, and T-Mobile’s German parent, Deutsche Telekom AG. “T-Mobile and Sprint are large corporations with established, well-financed corporate parents. They and their parent corporations are more than capable of paying substantial amounts to acquire spectrum in the incentive auction if they choose to do so,” Verizon said. Wheeler has repeatedly asserted that his goal is to ensure that non-dominant carriers in each market get some low-frequency spectrum. His plan would reserve up to 30 megahertz of airwaves in each market for carriers that do not already have one-third of low-band spectrum there, whether that be Verizon, AT&T; or a regional carrier. The reserve would kick in only after the auction reaches a particular trigger, which will be established in coming months. The FCC is slated to vote on formally proposing the rules at its May 15 meeting.

694,VZ,"UPDATE 1-Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway buys stake in Verizon, adds to Wal-Mart","(Adds analyst comment on Verizon, details on Wal-Mart, Buffett portfolio) NEW YORK, May 15 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc bought a new stake of 11 million shares in Verizon Communications Inc in the first quarter and added to its holding in Wal-Mart Stores Inc, according to a regulatory filing on Thursday. Shares of Verizon rose 1.6 percent to $48.75 in after-hours trading following the disclosure, in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing, detailing Berkshire’s U.S. common stock investments as of March 31. Shares of companies often rise after Berkshire reveals new stakes because some investors consider it a vote of confidence by Buffett and try to copy him. Verizon “has shown that with several changes in leadership, the company performs and is a premium provider, if not the premium provider in the market,” said analyst Roger Entner of Recon Analytics in Boston. Buffett “likes people who can execute,” Entner added. Investor Daniel Loeb’s Third Point LLC also opened a new stake in Verizon, buying 3.5 million shares. Verizon declined to comment. Berkshire’s regulatory filing did not say whether the Verizon investment was made by Buffett himself, or by one or both of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. U.S. regulators require large investors to disclose their stock holdings every quarter, and the disclosures can offer a window into their investment strategies. Berkshire, a conglomerate with over 80 businesses ranging from ice cream to insurance, added to stakes in other companies, as well, including DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc and IBM Corp, among others. Berkshire Hathaway reduced its stake in several companies, among them DirecTV and General Motors Co. It also reported a 17.3 percent boost in its stake in Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the world’s largest retailer, to 58.1 million shares, for a total of $4.44 billion. Though Berkshire owns several retail businesses such as Fruit of the Loom and the Nebraska Furniture Mart, Buffett is not known for specializing in that sector. Asked at Berkshire’s annual meeting on May 3 about when he goes out of his “circle of confidence” when investing, Buffett said “I’ve gone out of it more often in retail.” The Omaha, Nebraska-based company’s book value per share, Buffett’s preferred measure of growth, grew 2.6 percent from January to March this year. The conglomerate ended the first quarter with $118.5 billion in stock, more than half of which was in four companies: American Express Company, Wells Fargo, IBM and the Coca-Cola Company. While Buffett has said he makes Berkshire’s largest investments, some investments are made by Combs and Weschler, who oversee several billion dollars each. In afternoon trading, Berkshire’s Class A shares slipped 1.07 percent to $189,371 and its Class B shares dipped 0.92 percent to $126.36.

In a 3-2 vote along party lines, the Federal Communications Commission approved a plan that would reserve part of the spectrum in each market for carriers that do not already have substantial blocks of low-frequency airwaves there, largely restricting the participation of Verizon and AT&T.; Sprint Corp and T-Mobile USA Inc had urged the FCC to ensure their two biggest rivals did not dominate the auction.

The final rules, however, represent something of a compromise that reserves some airwaves for smaller carriers while ensuring that larger providers would be able to get sizeable chunks of spectrum in the unreserved portion. The FCC’s rules are based on current market structure, meaning that if Sprint acquires T-Mobile, for example, the rules would be revisited and could be rewritten. Sprint shares closed up 6 percent and T-Mobile shares closed up 1.3 percent on Thursday. “Investors are responding to hope of a merger. The less stringent the rules are on spectrum, the more leeway you have to allow one. The more even the playing field for all providers, the less you are excluding a potential combination of the two,” said Roger Entner of Recon Analytics. The auction, planned for mid-2015, would be a first opportunity in years for wireless carriers to buy the low-frequency airwaves considered the beachfront property of radio spectrum for their reach and strength. The rules set on Thursday would reserve up to 30 megahertz of spectrum in each market for bidding by non-nationwide carriers or companies with less than one-third of low-band spectrum in that market.

698,VZ,"Amid protests, U.S. FCC to vote on new 'net neutrality' proposal","WASHINGTON, May 15 (Reuters) - U.S. telecommunications regulators will vote on Thursday on whether to formally propose new “net neutrality” rules that may let Internet service providers charge content companies for faster and more reliable delivery of their traffic to users. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler has come under fire from consumer advocates and technology companies for proposing to allow some “commercially reasonable” deals where content companies could pay broadband providers to prioritize traffic on their networks. Critics worry the rules would create “fast lanes” for companies that pay up and mean slower traffic for others, although Wheeler has pledged to prevent “acts to divide the Internet between ‘haves’ and ‘have nots.’” Some 200 activists have said they plan to protest at the FCC on Thursday, joining a few hard core critics who have camped outside the agency for a week. Consumer advocates were also mobilizing Internet users to protest online on blogs and through social media. Those advocates want the FCC to reclassify Internet providers as utilities, like telephone companies, rather than as the less-regulated information services they are now. That move is opposed by broadband companies and Republicans, both in Congress and at the FCC. Opponents, including House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner and CEOs of major Internet providers, told Wheeler that stricter regulations would throw the industry into legal limbo, discourage investment in network infrastructure and still not prevent pay-for-priority deals. House Democrats have come out on both sides of the reclassification issue in recent communications to Wheeler. More than 100 technology companies, including Google Inc  and Facebook Inc, have spoken out against allowing pay-for-priority, although have not called for reclassification. Wheeler’s proposal reaches the tentative conclusion that some pay-for-priority deals may be allowed, but asks whether the FCC should presume “some or all” such deals are illegal, according to an FCC official briefed on the proposal. It also asks whether the FCC should instead consider reclassification or other net neutrality proposals. The two Republican FCC commissioners are expected to vote against Wheeler’s proposal. Wheeler’s two fellow Democrats have both expressed misgivings about the plan, but are likely to vote  to launch the process and open it up to public comment. The FCC will also vote on Thursday on rules for the sale of highly valuable low-frequency airwaves to wireless carriers. Those rules are expected to restrict how much the largest two providers, Verizon and AT&T;, can buy.    (Reporting by Alina Selyukh.

701,VZ,"Verizon CEO says not interested in Dish, focus on online streaming","NEW YORK, May 20 (Reuters) - Verizon’s CEO Lowell McAdam shot down rumors that the company was in potential merger talks with satellite operator Dish Network on Tuesday, days after rival AT&T; announced plans to buy no 1. U.S. satellite operator DirecTV. “I know there are reports out there that we are talking to Dish. I can tell you now, that is someone’s fantasy. There were not, and there are not, discussions going on with Dish,” McAdam told investors at the J.P. Morgan Global Technology, Media and Telecom Conference. “I don’t think owning a satellite company is something I’m interested in at this point,” he said adding the company’s focus was on over-the-top programming, meaning content utilized over a network, but not offered by a network operator. On Monday, speculation that Verizon and Dish were in talks to merge pulled shares up at Dish. AT&T;’s plans to purchase DirecTV raises questions about Dish’s next move. With 14 million subscribers, Dish trails DirecTV and has spent billions for wireless spectrum it has yet to use. Dish’s chief, Charles Ergen, has said he does not have the cash to outbid AT&T; for DirecTV. Dish tried to buy DirecTV in 2001 in a deal that was blocked by regulators.

702,VZ,Fitch Rates Verizon Communications' Proposed Exchange Offering 'A-'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 29 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to Verizon  Communications Inc.'s (NYSE: VZ) proposed senior unsecured exchange notes due  2024. VZ will commence an offer to exchange up to GBP600 million of 8.875% notes  due 2018 previously issued by Cellco Partnership and Verizon Wireless Capital  LLC for the new VZ notes and cash. Fitch's current Issuer Default Rating for VZ  is 'A-' with a Stable Rating Outlook. KEY RATING DRIVERS --The February 2014 acquisition of the remaining Verizon Wireless (VZW) stake  pressures VZ's near-term credit metrics, pushing pro forma leverage at closing  to approximately 2.6x. Actual gross leverage at March 31, 2014 was 2.5x, with  total debt at $109.8 billion. With the close of the acquisition, Fitch expects  VZ to materially reduce debt over the next few years. EBITDA growth, combined  with debt reductions is expected to reduce leverage to approximately 2x by the  end of 2016. Fitch believes this level is appropriate for an 'A-' rating. --While leverage will be outside an appropriate range for an 'A-' rating for  several years, Fitch believes metrics will return to a level appropriate for the  rating due to VZ's strong position in the wireless industry and the significant  cash flows generated by the wireless business. This is in combination with VZ  management's commitment to delever, as evidenced by the aggressive delevering  following the acquisition of Alltel Corporation in early 2009. Other supporting  factors include the absence of operations-related execution risk. --A key to debt reduction over the next several years will be the continued  generation of strong free cash flow (FCF) at VZW. VZW's simple FCF (EBITDA less  capital spending) in 2013 was approximately $24.8 billion. VZ's consolidated FCF  (after dividends and capital spending but before distributions to Vodafone) was  $16.3 billion in 2013. Owing to the acquisition of the remaining VZW stake,  Fitch estimates VZ's FCF will be at least 50% lower in 2014 as a result of  transaction-related interest costs, higher dividend requirements due to the  shares issued to Vodafone equity holders and higher cash taxes. --The strong competitive position of VZW as evidenced by industry-low churn  rates, high margins and the most developed LTE network in the U.S. support  expectations for VZ's cash flow stability and the longer rating horizon embodied  in the rating. VZ's liquidity is supported by its consolidated cash balances, which were $2.9  billion at March 31, 2014, and by a $6.2 billion credit facility. Fitch expects  VZ to maintain aggregate CP balances within a level fully backed by the  facility. The credit facility has no ratings triggers or other restrictive  covenants, such as leverage or interest coverage tests. In August 2013, the  facility was extended for a year and now matures in August 2017. After the  effect of letters of credit (LOCs), approximately $6.1 billion is available on  the facility. To provide additional liquidity, a $2 billion, 364-day revolving credit facility  became effective in February 2014. This facility has a 3.5x leverage covenant.  On a consolidated basis, VZ and its subsidiaries have scheduled debt maturities  of approximately $0.8 billion and $2.6 billion in 2014 and 2015, respectively. In 2014, Fitch expects consolidated capital spending to range from $16.5 billion  to $17 billion, comparable to or slightly higher than the $16.6 billion spent in  2013. Investment in the wireless network continues to be an area of emphasis due  to the strong demand for 4G LTE capacity for rapidly growing data services. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch believes a positive rating action is unlikely in the foreseeable future,  given the leverage incurred in the Vodafone transaction. Conversely, Fitch may take negative rating action if: --Operating performance causes delevering to take place at a materially slower  than anticipated pace; --A weakening of VZW's competitive position that would jeopardize the stability  of cash flows.

703,VZ,Exclusive: Intel TV creator leaves Verizon months after deal,"SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Erik Huggers is leaving Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) just five months after joining the company via the acquisition of the Intel Corp (INTC.O) “OnCue” streaming service he developed, signaling the communications giant’s waning interest in providing an Internet-delivered TV service. The former BBC executive, who told Reuters on Friday he is departing the company, had worked on OnCue for Intel for more than two years before Verizon bought it in January to accelerate a push into video services, including TV channels delivered over the Internet, known as an “over the top”, or OTT, service. While other companies have been talking up their plans to deliver such a service, a source familiar with the matter said that Verizon was now moving away from the OTT strategy and that the departure of Huggers, who was a proponent of an Internet-only service, reflected that. A Verizon spokesman confirmed Huggers’ departure and in regards to its strategy said, “We obtained a strong combination of technological and personnel assets from Intel Media. We intend to strategically utilize the OnCue technology and talent going forward to grow our business. That has not changed.” Verizon had previously said OnCue would help it offer video over its Fios fiber-optic infrastructure as well.  Seen by some as a bold attempt to revolutionize TV and others as a distraction from Intel’s chip business, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich pulled the plug and put the unit up for sale before it was launched.  Intel’s retreat from streaming TV was a disappointment to people in Silicon Valley who hoped the technology company could break open a market tightly controlled by a handful of cable and entertainment conglomerates. With the acquisition, Huggers and many of his employees moved over to Verizon, where he hoped to launch the service to consumers. But he told Reuters he advised his staff on Thursday that he was leaving the company. Huggers said in an interview he had worked well with his immediate boss at Verizon, Marni Walden, recently appointed to head product development, as well as Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam.  “There were no conflicts at all. The technology is great, the team is great, the future is secure, the dream lives on. It’s time to hand the baby over to someone else,” he said. Verizon’s rivals are working on their own Internet TV services. AT&T; Inc (T.N), which made an offer to buy DirecTV last week in a $45.5 billion deal, has said it would take 12 to 18 months for the combined companies to come up with an over-the-top service.  Dish Network Corp (DISH.O) has said it expects to launch its personalized streaming product by year-end, having already struck a deal for programming from Walt Disney Co (DIS.N).

705,VZ,Verizon demands Netflix stop messages on slow streaming,"LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc on Thursday demanded that Netflix Inc immediately stop displaying messages to customers that place blame on Verizon’s broadband service for slow delivery of Netflix TV shows and movies.   The letter is the latest sign of tension between content providers like Netflix and Internet service providers over who should pay the price for companies that stream heavy traffic online. In a cease-and-desist letter sent to Netflix, Verizon also asked the video streaming service to provide information including a list of customers on the Verizon network to whom Netflix delivered the notices, or face legal action. “Failure to provide this information may lead us to pursue legal remedies,” Verizon general counsel Randal Milch said in a letter to Netflix general counsel David Hyman. In mid-May, Netflix started a test of messages displayed on the screen for some customers when a video is buffering. The messages say that there is congestion on the network of Verizon or another Internet service provider. Netflix said on Thursday the test is continuing and meant to provide customers more information about their service, similar to a speed index that Netflix has published for months with a ranking of Internet service providers.  “This is about consumers not getting what they paid for from their broadband provider,” Netflix spokesman Jonathan Friedland said. “We are trying to provide more transparency, just like we do with the ISP Speed Index, and Verizon is trying to shut down that discussion.” David Young, Verizon’s vice president of federal regulatory affairs, told Reuters he felt the messages were part of a Netflix agenda to promote its views in Washington. Netflix has been urging the Federal Communications Commission to prevent broadband providers such as Verizon from charging Netflix fees for faster delivery of videos.     “That seems to be the motivation, to try to make a point or make points in that discussion that is going on in Washington D.C.,” Young said in a phone interview, though he wouldn’t specify the issues.      In the letter, Verizon said the message’s assertions were deceptive and inaccurate and that the responsibility for slow streaming on the site falls on Netflix.  Verizon said that in order to save money, Netflix relies on middlemen to distribute its content knowing that some of them have issues with congestion in some networks.  In April, Netflix said it reluctantly signed a deal to pay fees to Verizon to bypass those middlemen and deliver content directly to the company, ensuring faster speeds. But Verizon is still working to implement the needed architecture and expects to finish improvements by the end of 2014, said Young.  “I sincerely hope this is not a harbinger of things to come in terms of how Netflix treats its partners and our mutual customers,” Milch said in the letter. The Verizon notices came to light this week when a reporter who was a Verizon user tweeted about them. Comcast Corp, which also receives connection fees from Netflix, is not aware of any reports of Netflix buffering messages to its customers, a Comcast spokeswoman said.

707,VZ,"Sprint, T-Mobile deal to face fierce U.S. antitrust headwinds","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sprint Corp (S.N) and T-Mobile TMUS.N might have some fresh arguments to allay regulator skepticism about a merger, but the government may still be reluctant to approve shrinking the U.S. wireless market from four main players to three.     Analysts said a decline in shares of both companies on Thursday reflected those high regulatory hurdles. T-Mobile closed 2.3 percent lower and Sprint 4 percent lower.  Sprint, purchased by Japan’s Softbank Corp (9984.T) in 2013, has agreed to pay about $40 per share, or over $32 billion, for T-Mobile US, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, bringing to a head a long-discussed and controversial deal to reshape the U.S. cellphone market.   But top U.S. antitrust and communications enforcers have already warned that the wireless market is too concentrated. In 2011 the Justice Department stopped a bid by AT&T; Inc (T.N), No. 2 in the market, to buy struggling T-Mobile. Top dog Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and AT&T; each have roughly twice as many subscribers as either Sprint or T-Mobile, in the third and fourth spots by numbers of subscribers.  Bill Baer, the assistant attorney general for antitrust, said in January that it would difficult for his agency to approve a big wireless mergers. “It’s going to be hard for someone to make a persuasive case that reducing four firms to three is actually going to improve competition for the benefit of American consumers,” Baer told the New York Times.  Masayoshi Son, CEO of Softbank, trekked to Washington in February to seek the counsel of Tom Wheeler, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, but got a cool response to a potential merger. Wheeler has not hinted at any softening of that stance. Antitrust experts called the unusually public cautions from Wheeler and Baer a warning. “This is going to be a tough road for them. Tough,” said one expert, who spoke anonymously to protect business relationships. “In the wake of AT&T;/T-Mobile, this deal faces long odds.” The Justice Department noted T-Mobile’s role as a maverick and price-cutter as a reason to stop the earlier deal. That dynamic has not changed, said David Balto, a veteran of the Federal Trade Commission now in private practice.  “There’s a segment of the market which needs to have competition protected, which is the value (discount) segment,” Balto said. “This is where these guys go head to head.”     A third antitrust expert said the companies might have cards yet to play to win approval: “There may be good arguments (for the deal) that we just haven’t seen yet. But ... the odds are heavily against the deal.” SoftBank is likely to argue that the huge pending mergers of Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) with Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N and AT&T; with DirecTV DTV.O reinforce the danger of creating a handful of media and telecom giants. That threat was underlined when the FCC in May voted to restrict AT&T; and Verizon in the 2015 auction of highly valued low-frequency airwaves.  But others say approval this year of a merger between US Airways and American Airlines was a sign regulators could be convinced of the merits of a deal that reduces the number of competitors but creates a stronger number three.  “They need a game-changing idea,” said Robert McDowell, a former Republican FCC commissioner.  “There has to be a new proposal in order to shake up the mindset of the Obama administration which has a ‘religious’ conviction against going from four to three national wireless carriers. I don’t see that proposal yet, but perhaps they’re working on it.”      ",6052014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tmobile-sprint-corp-antitrust/sprint-t-mobile-deal-to-face-fierce-u-s-antitrust-headwinds-idUSKBN0EG2QA20140605

709,VZ,FCC looking into slow Internet download speeds,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators will review agreements between Netflix, Verizon, Comcast and other content and Internet providers to figure out whether they are causing slow web download speeds for some consumers, especially for streaming video content.  Consumers have complained to the Federal Communications Commission about the ongoing spat between Netflix and Internet service providers (ISPs). Both sides accuse each other of causing a slowdown in Internet speeds by the way they route traffic.  “At the heart of this is whether ISPs that provide connectivity in the final mile to the home can advantage or disadvantage content providers, and therefore advantage or disadvantage consumers,” FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said on Friday.  Large content providers such as Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) have historically paid middlemen or ISPs to deliver their content to consumers. The specifics of such agreements, known as “interconnection” and sometimes “peering,” have been secret and outside of the FCC’s regulatory scope. The FCC earlier this year launched a new effort to set rules regulating how broadband providers manage Internet traffic on their networks. Netflix has urged the agency to begin regulating such agreements to do away with fees that content companies pay. Though the FCC has not indicated that it plans to regulate the deals, the agency is now asking multiple Internet service providers and content companies, particularly video service providers, to provide details, Wheeler said. “Consumers need to understand what is occurring when the Internet service they’ve paid for does not adequately deliver the content they desire, especially content they’ve also paid for,” he told reporters after a monthly FCC meeting. “What we are doing right now is collecting information, not regulating. We are looking under the hood. Consumers want transparency. They want answers. And so do I,” he said.  In an earlier statement Wheeler said the commission is “not suggesting that any company is at fault.”  Consumer advocates, who support stricter regulatory oversight of relationships between content and Internet providers, welcomed the step and called on the FCC to make details of those agreements public. It is unclear whether the FCC plans to do so. Analysts pegged the FCC’s move as a win for Netflix, which on Friday welcomed the move toward more transparency. “Americans deserve to get the speed and quality of Internet access they pay for,” Netflix spokesman Joris Evers said in a statement. Netflix earlier this year agreed to pay fees to Verizon Communications (VZ.N) and Comcast (CMCSA.O) to bypass middlemen and deliver content directly to the companies’ subscribers, ensuring faster speeds. “Netflix has been paying (for traffic delivery) since inception. It wants free, I get it, but someone has to pay for it,” Jim Cicconi, AT&T; Inc (T.N) senior executive vice president for external and legislative affairs, said earlier this week. Netflix streaming accounts for nearly one-third of North American web traffic during peak times, according to research by Sandvine Corp. Netflix vice president for global public policy, Christopher Libertelli, this week said the company already invests money in delivering traffic to the Internet provider. “We pay a lot of money to drop content at the doorstep of an ISP. All we’re really asking is for the ISPs to swing the door open,” Libertelli said at the Aspen Institute think tank. “This has become a new choke point.” The FCC has regulated “net neutrality” only on the part of the network that goes from the Internet service providers to the consumer, and has not delved into what happens before that. The agency’s proposed net neutrality rules keep that distinction.  Comcast, Verizon and AT&T; welcomed the FCC’s review on Friday. Internet providers pointed out that traffic exchange fees have long been negotiated through commercial agreements and said they hoped the review would focus on consumers and not a particular business model.

716,VZ,UPDATE 2-German govt cancels Verizon contract in wake of U.S. spying row,"(Adds background on Verizon contract, paragraph 7) BERLIN, June 26 (Reuters) - The German government has cancelled a contract with U.S. telecoms firm Verizon Communications Inc as part of an overhaul of its internal communications, prompted by revelations last year of U.S. government spying. Reports based on disclosures by former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden alleged Washington had conducted mass surveillance in Germany and had even eavesdropped on Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone. Berlin subsequently demanded talks with Washington on a “no-spy” deal, but these collapsed after the United States appeared unwilling to give the assurances Germany wanted. Germany also launched an overhaul of its internal communications and secure government networks. This is one of the first actions involving a U.S. firm to result. “The pressures on networks as well as the risks from highly developed viruses or Trojans are rising,” Germany’s Interior Ministry said in a statement on Thursday. “Furthermore, the ties revealed between foreign intelligence agencies and firms in the wake of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) affair show that the German government needs a very high level of security for its critical networks.” Verizon has been providing network infrastructure for the German government’s Berlin-Bonn network, used for communication between ministries, since 2010, the statement said. The contract is set to expire in 2015. The government said Deutsche Telekom AG would replace services provided by Verizon, and noted Deutsche Telekom was already responsible for the most sensitive communications between ministries or between the government and German intelligence agencies. Information on the value of the contract was not immediately available. According to reports and documents published last year, Verizon was obliged to turn over international and domestic calling records of its customers to U.S. intelligence agencies. Verizon is the second-biggest U.S. telephone company behind AT&T; Inc in terms of revenue. Detlef Eppig, head of Verizon’s German unit Verizon Germany said on Thursday: “Verizon Germany is a German company and we comply with German law.” Verizon did not receive any demands from Washington in 2013 for data stored in other countries, the company said. “The U.S. government cannot compel us to produce our customers’ data stored in data centres outside the U.S., and if it attempts to do so, we would challenge that attempt in a court,” it added. The firm declined to comment on whether there had been requests in previous years.

JP Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo are leading the refinancing. Verizon declined to comment. BAML, JP Morgan, Citi and Morgan Stanley also declined to comment.  Barclays and Wells Fargo could not be reached by press time.

The new revolver also replaces an existing $2 billion, 364-day revolving credit. The $8 billion, four-year revolver will pay 10bp undrawn for current ratings of Baa1/BBB+. If drawn, the revolver pays 162.5bp. In addition, the company is seeking to amend its existing $3.3 billion, five-year term loan. Pricing on the term loan opens at LIB+125. In September 2013, Verizon announced its plans to acquire the 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless that it did not already own from Vodafone. The acquisition was backed with a $61 billion bridge loan led by JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, BAML and Barclays. JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley were global coordinators of the financing. The $61 billion bridge loan was replaced with $49 billion of bonds and $12 billion in three- and five-year term loans. Separately, the financing included a $2 billon, 364-day revolver. Pricing on the $6 billion, three-year term loan and $6 billion, five-year term loan is LIB+137.5 and LIB+150, respectively. The $2 billion, 364-day revolver pays 10bp on undrawn amounts. Drawn pricing on the facility is LIB+125. In February, the company drew $6.6 billion in term loans evenly split between the three-year and five-year facilities. The $3.3 billion in term debt currently being refinanced is outstanding under the five-year facility. Also in September 2013, the company refinanced a $6.2 billion four-year revolver. The revolver pays 10bp undrawn. On January 28, shareholders of both Vodafone and Verizon approved Verizon’s $130 billion takeover of their Verizon Wireless venture.

728,VZ,Verizon revenues top estimates on wireless surge,"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc, the largest U.S. wireless telecommunications company, on Tuesday reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue on a jump in wireless customers and a surge in tablet sales. The increase in customers is a boost for Verizon, which has been reluctant to follow rivals like T-Mobile US Inc which have discounted aggressively.  Profit in the second quarter also topped Wall Street estimates. Net additions of wireless subscribers with contracts surged 53 percent to 1.4 million in the second quarter ended June 30. That included a record 1.15 million in tablet sales.  Wireless companies have been weaning customers from plans that subsidize equipment financing over two years, and offering plans that separate service charges from equipment purchases. Verizon has not been aggressively promoting such plans, and said only 18 percent of wireless customers signed up for them.  “We want our customers to have choice. We did not abandon the legacy model when we launched our installment plan as other carriers have,” said Fran Shammo, Verizon’s chief financial officer. Two-year pricing plans have long served as a natural buffer against customer switching, according to Craig Moffett, chief analyst at MoffettNathanson. “Verizon has maintained all along that the industry shouldn’t be so quick to abandon a strategy that has served it awfully well for last decade,” said Moffett. “The risk is that the other carriers will continue to test lower and lower prices until the market finds a new equilibrium and that Verizon will be increasingly isolated at the high end of the market,” he added. The company has focused on retaining customers who bring more monthly revenue and switching them to products such as smartphones and tablets that generate more profit. Despite its premium prices, the company has been able to reduce customer defections, with an average rate of 1.25 percent compared with 1.37 percent last quarter.   Verizon’s wireline revenue rose for the first time in seven years due to increased adoption of its FiOS internet and television products, as well as the migration of customers from older copper lines, to better performing fiber.  The company said it added 100,000 FiOS video customers and 139,000 net new FiOS Internet connections in the quarter. Verizon shares edged up 0.3 percent at $50.85. The stock has risen about 3 percent so far this year, underperforming the S&P; 500, which is up 7.4 percent.  Excluding items, the company earned 91 cents per share in the quarter. Analysts, on average, expected a profit of 90 cents per share on revenue of $31.12 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Verizon’s wireless revenue, which accounts for more than two-third of total revenue, rose 7.5 percent due to strong growth in service revenue. Average monthly revenue per account rose 4.7 percent to $159.73.

731,VZ,Fitch Rates Verizon Communications' Proposed Exchange Offering 'A-'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 24 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to Verizon  Communications Inc.'s (NYSE: VZ) proposed senior unsecured exchange notes due  2020, 2046 and 2054. VZ commenced an offer to exchange up to $12 billion of  existing senior unsecured notes that it (or its subsidiaries) had previously  issued for the new VZ notes. Fitch's current Issuer Default Rating for VZ is  'A-' with a Stable Rating Outlook. KEY RATING DRIVERS --The February 2014 acquisition of the remaining Verizon Wireless (VZW) stake  pressures VZ's near-term credit metrics, pushing pro forma leverage at closing  to approximately 2.6x. Actual gross leverage at June 30, 2014 was 2.5x, with  total debt at $110 billion. With the close of the acquisition, Fitch expects VZ  to materially reduce debt over the next few years. EBITDA growth, combined with  debt reductions is expected to reduce leverage to approximately 2x by the end of  2016. Fitch believes this level is appropriate for an 'A-' rating. --While leverage will be outside an appropriate range for an 'A-' rating for  several years, Fitch believes metrics will return to a level appropriate for the  rating due to VZ's strong position in the wireless industry and the significant  cash flows generated by the wireless business. This is in combination with VZ  management's commitment to delever, as evidenced by the aggressive delevering  following the acquisition of Alltel Corporation in early 2009. Other supporting  factors include the absence of operations-related execution risk. --A key to debt reduction over the next several years will be the continued  generation of strong free cash flow (FCF) at VZW. VZW's simple FCF (EBITDA less  capital spending) for the LTM ending June 30, 2014 was approximately $25.3  billion. Owing to the acquisition of the remaining VZW stake, Fitch estimates  VZ's FCF (after dividends and capital spending) will be in the $3 billion to $5  billion range in 2014 as a result of transaction-related interest costs, higher  dividend requirements due to the shares issued to Vodafone equity holders and  higher cash taxes. --The strong competitive position of VZW as evidenced by industry-low churn  rates, high margins and the most developed LTE network in the U.S. support  expectations for VZ's cash flow stability and the longer rating horizon embodied  in the rating. VZ's liquidity is supported by its consolidated cash balances, which were $5.8  billion at June 30, 2014, and by a $6.2 billion credit facility. Fitch expects  VZ to maintain aggregate CP balances within a level fully backed by the  facility. The credit facility has no ratings triggers or other restrictive  covenants, such as leverage or interest coverage tests. In August 2013, the  facility was extended for a year and now matures in August 2017. After the  effect of letters of credit (LOCs), approximately $6.1 billion is available on  the facility. To provide additional liquidity, a $2 billion, 364-day revolving credit facility  became effective in February 2014. This facility has a 3.5x leverage covenant.  On a consolidated basis, VZ and its subsidiaries have scheduled debt maturities  of approximately $0.8 billion and $2.6 billion in 2014 and 2015, respectively. In 2014, Fitch expects consolidated capital spending to range from $16.5 billion  to $17 billion, comparable to or slightly higher than the $16.6 billion spent in  2013. Investment in the wireless network continues to be an area of emphasis due  to the strong demand for 4G LTE capacity for rapidly growing data services. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch believes a positive rating action is unlikely in the foreseeable future,  given the leverage incurred in the Vodafone transaction. Conversely, Fitch may take negative rating action if: --Operating performance causes delevering to take place at a materially slower  than anticipated pace; --A weakening of VZW's competitive position that would jeopardize the stability  of cash flows.

734,VZ,U.S. regulator questions Verizon plan to slow data speeds for some,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. telecommunications regulator said on Wednesday he is “deeply troubled” by Verizon Communications Inc’s plan to slow data downloads for some high-speed wireless customers remaining on the older unlimited data plans. Verizon, the largest U.S. wireless carrier, stopped offering unlimited data plans in 2012 and last week said it will begin slowing services for the top 5 percent of data users who are on such data plans in places where the network is experiencing high demand.  The policy is already in effect for unlimited subscribers on the 3G network but would now be expanded to the higher-speed 4G network.  But Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler raised concerns about the plan on Wednesday. “I am deeply troubled by your July 25, 2014 announcement that Verizon Wireless intends to slow down some customers’ data speeds on your 4G LTE network starting in October 2014,” Wheeler wrote in a letter to Verizon Wireless President and CEO Daniel Mead released by the FCC. “It is disturbing to me that Verizon Wireless would base its ‘network management’ on distinctions among its customers’ data plans, rather than on network architecture or technology. ... I know of no past Commission statement that would treat as ‘reasonable network management’ a decision to slow traffic to a user who has paid, after all, for ‘unlimited’ service.” A Verizon Wireless spokesman said the company’s officials will officially respond to Wheeler’s letter once they have received and reviewed it. “What we announced last week was a highly targeted and very limited network optimization effort, only targeting cell sites experiencing high demand,” the spokesman said. “The purpose is to ensure there is capacity for everyone in those limited circumstances, and that high users don’t limit capacity for others.” Although No. 3 and No. 4 carriers Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc continue to offer some versions of unlimited data plans to new subscribers, U.S. wireless carriers have been working to shift their increasingly data-hungry subscribers onto tiered pricing plans, which charge customers for specific amounts of data they agree to consume. For Wheeler, the letter represented another push against an Internet service provider (ISP) as he seeks to establish himself as a strong defender of web users’ interests who would punish ISPs whose business practices may hurt consumers or competition.  His efforts follow the FCC’s controversial proposal of new “net neutrality” rules that guide how broadband providers manage web traffic on their networks, which has drawn fire from consumer advocates, the public and some Internet companies. In Wednesday’s letter, Wheeler also posed to Mead several questions about the plan, including the rationale to treat consumers differently depending on their data plans, the reasons behind extending speed reduction from the slower-speed 3G network to the more efficient high-speed 4G LTE network, and how Verizon would justify the plan under its current regulatory obligations, including those meant to protect “net neutrality.” ",7302014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-verizon-mobilephone-data/u-s-regulator-questions-verizon-plan-to-slow-data-speeds-for-some-idUSKBN0FZ2CR20140730

737,VZ,Verizon defends slowdown of unlimited customers' data to FCC,"WASHINGTON, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc  defended its decision to slow data downloads for some customers using older unlimited data plans, telling U.S. regulators it was a “widely accepted” and lawful part of network management. In a letter dated Aug. 1, Verizon responded to U.S. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler, who last week wrote Verizon Wireless Chief Executive Dan Mead to say he was “deeply troubled” by Verizon’s plans. In July, Verizon said high speed wireless customers who subscribe to the company’s legacy unlimited data plans might experience slower speeds starting Oct. 1. [ID:nL2N0Q52R7} The company has a similar policy in place for customers on its slower 3G network. “The type of network optimization policy that we follow has been endorsed by the FCC as a narrowly targeted way to ensure a fair allocation of capacity during times of congestion,” Kathleen Grillo, senior vice president of federal regulatory affairs at Verizon, said in the letter. “In short this practice has been widely accepted with little or no controversy,” Grillo added in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters. Verizon, the largest U.S. wireless carrier, noted that the practice of slowing down certain users’ networks in order to prevent congestion has been widely used by broadband providers and its competitors. “We absolutely know that it was the right thing to do and we know that it was in line with the FCC’s principles,” Mead said on Monday, in a meeting with a group of journalists. Wheeler’s reprimand of Verizon came as he is seeking to establish himself as a strong defender of web users’ interests and someone prepared to punish Internet service providers whose  business practices may hurt consumers or competition. His efforts follow the FCC’s proposal of new “net neutrality” rules that guide how broadband providers manage web traffic on their networks, which has drawn fire from consumer advocates, the public and some Internet companies. Verizon added that while its high speed network has great advantage over its slower 3G network, its capacity remains shared and limited. Verizon stopped offering unlimited plans in 2012.

738,VZ,UPDATE 1-U.S. FCC asks if broadband should mean faster Internet speeds,"(Adds details of inquiry, comments) By Alina Selyukh WASHINGTON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday proposed changing how it measures high-speed Internet to potentially require download speeds of 10 megabits per second (Mbps) or higher for a service to qualify as broadband. The FCC currently defines broadband, or high-speed Internet, as 4 Mbps download speed and 1 Mbps upload speed. The agency will seek public comment on whether those bandwidth thresholds should be increased and whether different ones should be set for wired and wireless connections. In a “notice of inquiry” released on Tuesday, the FCC asked whether download speeds of 10 Mbps or higher should qualify as broadband and whether the minimum upload speed rate should also be higher to adequately address consumers’ needs. “As more people adopt faster broadband speeds, we are asking if all consumers, even in the most rural regions, should have greater access to better broadband,” FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said in a statement. U.S. consumers are increasingly using the Internet to stream music and videos, make calls or use other services that continue to demand faster speeds. For instance, Netflix recommends a 5 Mbps Internet connection speed to stream video in high definition. The FCC’s recent assessments suggested a 10 Mbps download bandwidth benchmark could satisfy moderate but not high Internet use by a household of three. U.S. telecommunications law gives the FCC the authority to regulate Internet service providers (ISPs) such as Verizon Communications Inc, Comcast Corp and AT&T; Inc as it oversees the roll-out of broadband services to all Americans “in a reasonable and timely fashion.” A higher speed threshold for broadband, could influence the U.S. government’s perspective on competition among ISPs. The FCC’s recent reviews have found a notable portion of the U.S. population, particularly in rural areas, lacks access to high-speed Internet. If adopted, a stricter broadband definition could mean an even smaller part of the U.S. population would be deemed as having access to broadband and could reduce the areas of the country where the FCC considers high-speed Internet to be available. In Tuesday’s notice, the FCC asks when it may consider mobile services as a “functional equivalent” for fixed broadband and how it should address broadband availability in areas where multiple ISPs operate but no service meets the broadband benchmark on its own. It also seeks comment on whether the FCC should measure speeds during hours of regular or peak use, how or whether it should consider the impact of data caps, and various other factors it could weigh. In its latest report on progress in broadband deployment, in 2012, the FCC found 6 percent of Americans lacked access to fixed broadband service. In rural areas, that group comprised one-fourth of the population. The FCC now will collect comments on a potential change of broadband definition for 45 days as it prepares a new Broadband Progress Report, an FCC official said.   (Reporting by Alina Selyukh.

740,VZ,UPDATE 2-Dish chairman says bid for T-Mobile possible now Sprint is out,"(Adds Ergen comments on spectrum, analyst comment; updates shares) By Liana B. Baker and Lisa Richwine NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Dish Network Corp  Chairman Charlie Ergen said it makes sense for the satellite operator to consider making a bid for T-Mobile US Inc  now that Sprint is out of the picture. “Certainly to the extent that Sprint either dropped out or wasn’t interested or the government wouldn’t allow it ... then T-Mobile is something that we would have an interest in,” Ergen said on Wednesday on a conference call after Dish reported quarterly results. Investors have been watching for any signs of what Ergen plans to do with the spectrum the company has spent billions stockpiling over the past few years. Possible plans include a partnership with another wireless player or building or buying a wireless network. While the company’s core pay TV business has stalled, Dish shares have risen more than 40 percent to $63.81 over the past 12 months mainly on investors’ high hopes for the value of the company’s spectrum. Late Tuesday, Sprint Corp dropped its planned bid to acquire T-Mobile U.S. Inc, the No. 4 U.S. carrier, after regulatory hurdles proved too steep, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Ergen said he was not surprised that Sprint walked away from T-Mobile and called it a “smart move,” considering the public resistance from regulators. “Sometimes the best deals you do are the ones you walk away from, and it takes a lot of guts to do it,” he said. Ergen said Sprint’s abandoned plans for T-Mobile likely increase the options for his company, but executives have not yet discussed their plans. Still, the “announcement last night probably increased some optionality,” he said. Dish may face some competition to win T-Mobile from French telecom company Iliad, which threw its hat into the ring with a $15 billion offer last week, T-Mobile’s parent company, Deutsche Telekom, has shown no interest in engaging with Iliad so far. Many investors have believed that Verizon Communications Inc  would step in and buy all of Dish or all of its spectrum, said Craig Moffett, senior analyst at MoffettNathanson. “Now, investors will have to get comfortable with a wider array of possible outcomes,” he wrote in a research note. Ergen reiterated that it was possible Dish would sell its spectrum but that was not his preferred option. “Unless we can build a business that’s more valuable than the core value, we’re a seller,” he said. “But if we can build a business long term that’s actually more valuable than the core value, then we’re going to go do that.” “We’re long-term players,” he added. “If you want somebody to flip some spectrum, make a quick buck, go buy somebody else.” Dish shares rose 1.6 percent, or 99 cents, to $63.14 in late-afternoon trading on Nasdaq.

746,VZ,UPDATE 2-SoftBank's first Sony smartphone deal takes aim at U.S. market,"* Mobile is weak link in Sony’s struggling electronics division * New Xperia to be launched in Japan for winter holiday season * Sprint looking to bolster handset line-up to keep subscribers * Sharp Corp developed smartphone exclusively for SoftBank/Sprint   (Adds details on Sprint pricing strategy, Sony carrier relations) By Yoshiyasu Shida and Reiji Murai TOKYO, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Japan’s SoftBank Corp and its U.S. mobile carrier Sprint Corp will offer a Sony  smartphone for the first time, sources with knowledge of the matter said, as the two technology titans confront daunting challenges in the U.S. market. The deal could give a much-needed boost to Sony’s struggling mobile division, which last month said it no longer expected to make a profit in the year to next March. It will also bolster Sprint’s handset line-up as it seeks to stem a flight in subscribers. SoftBank, Japan’s second most valuable company, is pushing price cuts and promotions at Sprint while unveiling joint smartphone offerings to shore up the No. 3 U.S. carrier, after U.S. regulators thwarted its hopes for a merger to give it the scale to take on bigger rivals. Sony, long one of Japan’s best-known brands but now struggling to pull its flagship electronics division out of the red, has been unable to gain traction in the key U.S. smartphone market, depressing a mobile unit that it hopes to make a pillar of its revival. Sony managed only a 2.1 percent share of the global smartphone market in 2013, according to market research firm Gartner, and now faces rising competition from low-cost Chinese smartphones. In the U.S. market, the only carrier offering its handsets is No. 4 T-Mobile US Inc. Sony will sell a soon-to-be launched Xperia flagship phone in the United States via Sprint, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. In Japan, SoftBank will make the phone available in time for the winter holiday season, they added. Sony and SoftBank declined to comment. Sony is expected to unveil its next flagship smartphone, the Xperia Z3, at next week’s IFA tech expo in Berlin. But the company remains far behind the big names in the industry: Apple Inc, which is set to unveil its new iPhone 6 next month, and Samsung Electronics Co, which makes the Galaxy series. “I can’t see this making much of a difference,” said Deutsche Bank analyst Yasuo Nakane of the Sprint deal, stressing the importance of a deal with a major carrier such as Verizon Communications Inc - along with AT&T; Inc one of the top two U.S. carriers - to get critical mass in that market. Sony offers an Xperia tablet through Verizon. “Even if they put out a phone on Sprint, Verizon is the priority any way you think about it,” Nakane said. Masahiro Ono, an analyst at Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities, nevertheless saw the deal as a move in the right direction. “They haven’t been able to maintain very good relationships with carriers, unlike Samsung who has done very well,” he said. Sprint’s aggressive strategy on new handsets and price cuts, with the unveiling last week of a smartphone developed by Sharp Corp exclusive for Sprint and SoftBank, is likely to accelerate under new chief executive Marcelo Claure, plucked from handset reseller Brightstar Corp which SoftBank acquired last year. SoftBank CEO and founder Masayoshi Son has vowed bold moves by Sprint since a proposal to merge with T-Mobile US was withdrawn early this month.

747,VZ,Verizon to pay $7.4 million over failure to notify consumers on privacy rights,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc will pay $7.4 million to settle a U.S. investigation that found the company failed to notify properly some customers of their privacy rights before using their information for marketing, U.S. regulators said on Wednesday. The Federal Communications Commission said its investigation found that starting in 2006, some 2 million new Verizon phone customers did not receive proper privacy notices in their first  bill. The notices would have told consumers how to opt out of having their personal information used to tailor marketing offers, which the company later sent to some of them.  Phone companies are generally prohibited from using personal data they collect from their customers, though such data can be used for marketing if the consumer gives permission.  “It is plainly unacceptable for any phone company to use its customers’ personal information for thousands of marketing campaigns without even giving them the choice to opt out,” Travis LeBlanc, acting chief of the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau, said in a statement. Verizon, which said only landline customers were affected, reported the discrepancy to the FCC on Jan. 18, 2013, though the FCC said it was aware of the problem in September 2012. Verizon has now agreed to send opt-out notices on every bill and pay the largest fine in FCC’s history of settlements over investigations into telephone customers’ personal data privacy, the agency said. “The issue here was that a notice required by FCC rules inadvertently was not provided to certain of Verizon’s wireline customers before they received marketing materials from Verizon for other Verizon services that might be of interest to them,” said company’s spokesman Ed McFadden. “It did not involve a data breach or an unauthorized disclosure of customer information to third parties. Verizon takes seriously its obligation to comply with all FCC rules, and once we discovered the issue with the notices we informed the FCC, fixed the problem and implemented a number of measures to ensure it does not recur.”     ",9032014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-verizon-comms-fine/verizon-to-pay-7-4-million-over-failure-to-notify-consumers-on-privacy-rights-idUSKBN0GY1V920140903

750,VZ,"Sprint expands rural roaming program, adding 15 new carriers","WASHINGTON, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Sprint Corp said on Friday it was adding 15 new rural and regional wireless providers to its U.S. roaming program, a move bolstering the company’s efforts to cheaply expand its footprint as it fights to stay competitive as a national carrier. The program allows Sprint and its smaller partners to use each other’s networks for roaming at a mutually attractive price. A total of 27 carriers, covering 565,000 square miles and a population area of more than 38 million people, have now entered into roaming agreements with Sprint. The 27 partnerships could save Sprint about $1.9 billion in expenditures on new cell phone towers and other infrastructure that would be necessary to bring 4G coverage to new areas on its own, based on calculations provided by a source familiar with the program estimates. With those savings, deals with rural carriers could offer Sprint a lifeline to improve its national presence following the collapse of the merger with T-Mobile US Inc. Like T-Mobile’s, Sprint’s network has been largely concentrated around metropolitan areas while the coverage by the two biggest U.S. carriers, Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T; Inc, stretches nationwide. Growing its footprint is one of Sprint’s major challenges as the company struggles to win back millions of customers it lost during its messy network overhaul in recent years. The task is particularly tough in a nearly saturated market and with No. 4 T-Mobile pushing to leapfrog Sprint as the No. 3 U.S. carrier. In March, Sprint Chairman Masayoshi Son struck an agreement with the Competitive Carriers Association, which represents many U.S. rural and regional carriers, providing the framework for a rural roaming program. In June, Sprint announced the first 12 individual carriers to launch the rural roaming program into reality, including Virginia-based nTelos Wireless and Mississippi-based C Spire Wireless. The 15 new partners announced Friday include Kentucky-based Bluegrass Cellular, Idaho-based Syringa Wireless and Alabama-based Pine Belt Wireless. Perhaps because Sprint needs rural coverage more than its rivals, its 4G roaming agreements offer the carriers more perks and more flexibility than they have seen from other companies. Verizon’s program, for instance, largely limits partners to building networks that rely on airwaves owned by Verizon, while Sprint’s allows them to use their own spectrum. Sprint’s partners also say it offers more attractive roaming rates. Another major perk Sprint offers is access to devices at cheaper prices negotiated with handset distributors, solving a major problem for smaller carriers who are often stuck paying top dollar for devices because they lack their competitors’ scale.

751,VZ,"Verizon offers free iPhone 6 in return for two-year contract, used phone","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Verizon Communications will give subscribers who trade in an old iPhone a free iPhone 6 in exchange for a two-year contract, the country’s largest wireless carrier announced hours after Apple Inc unveiled the widely anticipated device. The announcement came as critics speculated that Apple’s newest phone, starting at $199 with a two-year contract, would not be competitive as more carriers eliminate contracts and unbundle service charges from the cost of devices.  Analysts say that by making the cost of devices more transparent, equipment financing plans make expensive handsets like the iPhone less appealing. On the other hand, the plans allow customers to pay for devices in installments, making pricy devices like the iPhone more accessible. Customers who trade in an iPhone 4, 4s, 5, 5c or 5s in working condition will receive a $200 gift card to pre-order the 16-gigabyte version of the newer model, Verizon said in a statement. The offer does not apply to Apple’s other new phone, the larger iPhone 6 Plus. Verizon has been more reluctant than competitors to dive into equipment financing, and its promotion indicates its attachment to the older contract model, which binds subscribers to the carrier for a fixed term, said Jan Dawson, analyst at JackDaw Research.  “There is an inherent risk in the shift to installment billing that it creates more loyalty to the device than to the carrier,” said Dawson. “Verizon sees the value of the two-year contract in that tying a device to a two-year plan can prevent churn,” said Dawson.  He pointed out that new device releases are major factors for subscribers in deciding whether to switch carriers. As the market for new smartphone customers shrinks, carriers have been competing aggressively for subscribers, slashing prices and engaging in creative promotions to poach each others’ customers.

753,VZ,Fitch Affirms Verizon's IDR at 'A-'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 10 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Verizon Communications  Inc.'s (NYSE: VZ) Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) and debt ratings as follows: --Long-term IDR at 'A-'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A-'; --Senior unsecured bank facility at 'A-'; --Senior unsecured term loan due 2019 at 'A-'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper (CP) at 'F2'. Fitch has also assigned an 'A-' rating to Verizon's USD$870 million senior  unsecured 4.8% notes due 2044 issued in Taiwan. The Rating Outlook is Stable. In addition, Fitch has reviewed and affirmed the ratings of certain VZ  subsidiaries. A detailed list of the affirmations follows at the end of this  release. KEY RATING DRIVERS --The February 2014 acquisition of the remaining Verizon Wireless (VZW) stake  pressured VZ's near-term credit metrics, pushing pro forma leverage at closing  to approximately 2.6x. Actual gross leverage at June 30, 2014 was 2.5x, with  total debt at $110 billion. With the close of the acquisition, Fitch expects VZ  to materially reduce debt over the next few years. EBITDA growth, combined with  debt reductions, is expected to reduce leverage to around 2x by the end of 2016,  a level more appropriate for an 'A-' rating. The precise timing of the reduction  in leverage is subject to some uncertainty, given the potential for spending in  upcoming auctions for wireless spectrum, a portion of which Fitch expects to be  initially debt funded.  --Fitch believes metrics will return to a level appropriate for the rating in  the 2016/2017 timeframe due to VZ's strong position in the wireless industry and  the significant cash flows generated by the wireless business. This is in  combination with VZ management's commitment to delever, as evidenced by the  aggressive delevering following the acquisition of Alltel Corporation in early  2009.  --A key to debt reduction over the next several years will be the continued  generation of strong free cash flow (FCF) at VZW. VZW's simple FCF (EBITDA less  capital spending) for the LTM ending June 30, 2014 was approximately $25.3  billion. Owing to the acquisition of the remaining VZW stake, Fitch estimates  VZ's FCF (after dividends and capital spending) will be in the $4 billion to $6  billion range in 2014 as a result of transaction-related interest costs, higher  dividend requirements due to the shares issued to Vodafone equity holders and  higher cash taxes. --VZW's strong competitive position, evidenced by industry-low churn rates on  average, high margins, and the most developed LTE network in the U.S. support  Fitch's expectations that VZ will maintain cash flow stability and support the  longer rating horizon for leverage metrics to return to levels consistent with  the rating. VZ's liquidity is supported by its reported consolidated cash balances, which  were $5.8 billion at June 30, 2014, and by its revolving credit facility. As of  June 30, 2014, the company had a $6.2 billion revolving credit facility due in  August 2017, as well as a $2 billion, 364-day revolving credit facility maturing  in February 2015. In July, Verizon amended its revolving credit facility to  increase the size to $8 billion from $6.2 billion and extended the maturity to  July 2018 from August 2017. Fitch expects VZ to maintain aggregate CP balances  within a level fully backed by the facility. The credit facility has no ratings  triggers or other restrictive covenants, such as leverage or interest coverage  tests.  On a consolidated basis, VZ and its subsidiaries have scheduled debt maturities  of approximately $0.8 billion and $2.6 billion in 2014 and 2015, respectively. In 2014, Fitch expects consolidated capital spending to range from $16.5 billion  to $17 billion, comparable to or slightly higher than the $16.6 billion spent in  2013. Investment in the wireless network continues to be an area of emphasis due  to the strong demand for 4G LTE capacity for rapidly growing data services. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch believes a positive rating action is unlikely in the foreseeable future,  given the leverage incurred in the Vodafone transaction. Conversely, Fitch may take negative rating action if operating performance  causes deleveraging to take place at a materially slower than anticipated pace,  either alone or in combination with spending on spectrum through 2016. Fitch  estimates even with some moderation in revenue growth and margin pressure that  Verizon could spend up to $15 billion on spectrum before pressuring the rating.  Discretionary management moves that cause leverage to rise above 2.5x, such as  another material acquisition or stock repurchases, could lead to a negative  action in the absence of a strong commitment to delever. Fitch has affirmed ratings of the following Verizon entities with a Stable  Outlook: Cellco Partnership --IDR at 'A-'; --Senior unsecured debt (co-issued with Verizon Wireless Capital LLC) at 'A-'. Verizon Wireless Capital LLC --Senior unsecured debt (co-issued with Cellco Partnership) at 'A-'. Alltel Corp. GTE Corp. Verizon Delaware Verizon California Verizon Florida Verizon Maryland Verizon New England Verizon New Jersey Verizon New York Verizon Pennsylvania Verizon Virginia --IDR 'A-'; --Senior unsecured at 'A-'. GTE Southwest --IDR 'A-'; --First mortgage bonds at 'A-'. Verizon Global Funding (merged into Verizon in 2006) --Senior unsecured at 'A-'. The following rating is withdrawn as the debt has been repaid: Verizon Communications Inc. --Senior unsecured term loan due 2017 'A-'. Fitch also affirms and withdraws the 'A-' IDR assigned to Verizon Wireless  Capital LLC due to a change in policy to no longer assign IDRs to  special-purpose financing entities that have no material assets, operational  function or revenues. Fitch will continue to rate debt issues at these  special-purpose financing entities, but in relationship to the parent company  IDR. Contact: Primary Analyst John C.

755,VZ,Verizon CEO says to launch Web TV product in 2015,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) plans to launch an Internet-based television service in the first half of next year, its chief executive said on Thursday, in a move intended to shake up traditional cable and satellite TV services. In January, Verizon bought an Intel Corp (INTC.O) venture to create a web-based TV service. The move raised expectations that a viable alternative to cable TV service could finally become a reality. Competition to create such a service has been intensifying lately, with Sony Corp (6758.T), Dish Network Corp (DISH.O) and DirecTV DTV.O developing similar products. “We are very focused on probably late first half of 2015 having products like this in the marketplace,” McAdam said at an industry conference in New York. Intel and others have struggled to lure content from media companies who prefer to sell bundles of channels to cable and satellite companies. But McAdam expressed optimism that broadcast and cable TV networks will agree to provide programming for such an “over-the-top” service. “It’s moved from a stiff-arm to more of an embrace,” he said, adding that the with regard to the big four TV networks and other content providers, “over the last six months to a year, that dialog is changing dramatically.” On Wednesday, Sony announced that it had secured the rights to carry 22 Viacom channels, including Comedy Central and MTV, for its own cloud-based television service. In another sign parts of the industry are warming to Internet TV, Time Warner Inc and CBS Corp said on Wednesday they were increasingly open to one day making HBO and Showtime available directly to consumers over the Internet. An increased willingness by media companies to make programming available for Web-TV services could squeeze cable TV providers by tempting subscribers to abandon them for cheaper or more flexible options.  Separately, McAdam also said Verizon would be open to selling some of its towers if the price was right. “Those deals are coming to us a little more now, and if an opportunity presented itself to increase shareholder value” Verizon would be interested in pursuing it, McAdam said at a Goldman Sachs media conference. The company had received preliminary offers at inadequate valuations two years ago, McAdam said. Coinciding with McAdam’s comments, Verizon said in a statement that net postpaid subscriber additions in its wireless business grew more than 40 percent in the current quarter due to strong adoption of 4G smartphones and tablets.  The company reported 927,000 net additions in the same period a year earlier. In July, Verizon said demand for FiOS Internet and television services had helped fuel its first gain in wireline revenue in seven years. The migration of customers from older copper lines to better performing fiber was another plus.  Verizon’s shares were up marginally at $48.93 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

756,VZ,Sprint seeks wireless partnerships to expand scale -CEO,"NEW YORK, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Sprint Corp is seeking partners to expand its scale in the wireless market after the collapse of its long sought-after takeover of T-Mobile US Inc , Chief Executive Officer Marcelo Claure said on Thursday. “We are wide open to having discussions with cable companies, over the top companies, other wireless carriers,” Claure said at a conference sponsored by Goldman Sachs. Such partnerships would allow Sprint to expand its reach and benefit from economies of scale, he said. Since being named Sprint CEO a month ago, Claure has underscored the importance of expanding coverage while cutting costs. Partnerships and acquisitions are a potential avenue to this goal even after Sprint and its parent company, SoftBank Corp , gave up pursuit of T-Mobile. “We are believers in consolidation,” said Claure, whose handset wholesaler, Brightstar Corp, was acquired by Sprint in February. “This is a scale game.” The proposed SoftBank-backed acquisition of T-Mobile would have given Sprint the necessary muscle to compete directly with Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T; Inc  , but the bid was abandoned after Sprint conceded that securing the approval of government regulators would be too formidable. Sprint shares were up 5 percent at $6.46 on Thursday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.

759,VZ,UPDATE 1-Entropic to explore strategic options amid order delays,"(Adds details, share movement, analyst comments) By Soham Chatterjee and Lehar Maan Sept 16 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Entropic Communications Inc  said it was exploring strategic options amid order delays that it warned would continue through the year, hurting the company’s efforts to turn a profit. Entropic, which did not say what those options were, also lowered its revenue forecast for the current quarter blaming slower spending by telecom and cable customers in light of several big mergers. The company’s shares rose as much as 11 percent but lost some of those gains to trade 3.2 percent higher at $2.84 by midday. “We expect continued softness in the fourth quarter as we are again seeing new product deployment delays,” Chief Financial Officer David Lyle said in a statement on Tuesday. Entropic supplies chips for set-top boxes for cable and satellite TV providers such as Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc. “The timing of the announcement is a little discouraging,” BWS Financial analyst Hamed Khorsand said. “The company has been going through a transition for several quarters and management has been continuously suggesting (fourth quarter) would be the turnaround point.” Entropic, which reported declining revenues in seven of its previous eight quarters, lowered its revenue forecast for the quarter ending Sept. 30 to $43 million, from its earlier outlook of between $49 million and $51 million. Also, the company said it now expects an adjusted loss of 15 cents per share for the third quarter, worse than its earlier loss forecast of 11 cents per share. Entropic said it had engaged Barclays to help explore strategic options and that it had not set a timetable for completion of the process. The company set in motion a restructuring plan in June, saying it would close and consolidate several offices globally, impacting 23 percent of its workforce and helping it save $24 million annually.

761,VZ,Verizon open to divesting cell tower assets: CFO,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc is open to divesting its network’s assets including its cell towers, the company’s chief financial officer said on Wednesday.   Verizon, which in February completed a $130 billion deal to buy Vodafone’s stake in Verizon Wireless and get full ownership over the company, has previously announced plans to trim some aspects of its portfolio.  CFO Fran Shammo said the company was inspired by rival AT&T;’s $4.85 billion sale of some of its towers to tower operator Crown Castle last year, a deal which preserved AT&T;’s right to lease and operate the towers for about 28 years. “The AT&T; deal was a good deal for them. It opened our eyes and we said ‘OK, maybe there is a way to get through this and protect our interest and get a deal that is palatable to us’,” Shammo told investors at a conference in Los Angeles, adding that Verizon wants to protect its ability to expand its network when necessary.  Shammo also said the company’s multicast technology, which allows mass audiences to stream content from multiple devices without crowding Verizon’s network, will be available in most devices the company launches in the fourth quarter.  Verizon is negotiating deals with content providers to create a web-based TV service delivered to mobile platforms outside of a linear TV subscription. However, Shammo predicts it will be a few years before the multicast technology translates into greater leverage for negotiations with content providers.  “It will take a year or two before we have a meaningful number of subscribers where content providers say ‘I can get my hands around this, you now have a meaningful base of subscribers’, he said.  The company will also have better leverage once Nielsen Holdings, which measures television audiences, is able to measure mobile audiences, he said.

A sale or leaseback of the towers similar to AT&T;’s deal at $500,000 per site could raise $6 billion in liquidity, Macquarie Securities analyst Kevin Smithen wrote in a note. “We believe there could be multiple bidders for this asset but believe the potential sale of the last sizeable U.S. tower asset could explain why CCI has not announced a capital return strategy to date,” Smithen said. The assets for sale would include about 12,000 towers and could be announced by year-end, according to a Bloomberg report.   (Reporting by Krishna Chaithanya in Bangalore and Liana B.

767,VZ,RPT-Connected cars: Is AT&T; leaving Verizon in its rear-view mirror?,"(Repeats with no changes) By Marina Lopes and Bernie Woodall WASHINGTON/DETROIT, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications, the No.1 U.S. wireless carrier known for its widespread coverage, is falling behind its biggest rival in what many are betting will be the next big thing in the wireless industry: connected cars. The reason? Simply put, the type of network Verizon uses isn’t global. The $1.7 trillion wireless industry has just about reached capacity for growth, and mobile companies are turning to connected devices for future revenue. Connected cars, which hook up with a wireless network, currently allow you to do everything from turning an auto into a Wifi link for other devices, to honking its horn from anywhere in the world. The cars are also able to update software remotely. The market for such technology is just getting ramped up. It produced revenue of $8 billion in 2013 and is expected to bring in $20 billion annually by 2018, according to Juniper Research. So far, AT&T; has announced deals with brands at eight automakers and Verizon is trailing with four announced deals. Sprint has announced two and T-Mobile has announced one. The value of such deals have not been disclosed. Verizon, for its part, rejects the notion that it is falling behind. It says it is offering more robust services to consumers and auto makers than its rivals. But AT&T; appears to have the edge because its network uses specifications that have become a global standard, analysts and consultants said. Verizon’s network specs are only used in a handful of countries. While that hasn’t stopped Verizon from becoming the United States’ most popular carrier, it puts the company at a disadvantage with automakers who want to manufacture cars that work on a common standard worldwide. AT&T; has also developed a universal SIM card for cars, tractors and shipments that can be programmed remotely to adapt to networks around the world. Verizon has to install location-specific settings on cars depending on where they are shipped. The global reach of AT&T;’s network type was a key factor in Audi’s decision to sign a deal with AT&T; in early September. “We needed a foreign app that was acceptable in Europe and the U.S.,” said Brad Stertz, Audi’s corporate communications manager. “That narrowed the choices for us at that point.” Unlike AT&T;’s 3G network, Verizon’s does not allow customers to make a phone call and access the Internet at the same time. So in an emergency, Verizon’s connected cars can’t diagnose problems with vehicle through its data network and call the customer through the car at the same time. This factor was one of the reasons General Motors Co.  signed a deal with AT&T; in February 2013 for a new line of connected cars, after almost 20 years in partnership with Verizon. “We all multi-task every day, so why shouldn’t our cars multi-task?” said Kevin Jackson, a connected customer specialist at General Motors. That’s not to say that Verizon cannot catch up. A new wave of technology known as Long-Term Evolution will eventually override the distinction between the two network types. By transforming voice calls into data, the technology will allow Verizon users to place calls and access the internet simultaneously. But analysts said automakers may have to wait until 2020 before the technology can be reliably used. At that point, they add, it may be too little, too late for Verizon. Verizon’s president of Telematics, Erik Goldman disagrees. The company, which in 2012 bought Hughes Telematics, a maker of voice and data connectivity systems for cars, is not providing just a wireless connection, he said. The company answers customer help lines for support on vehicles, trains car dealers to know how to properly activate the connection in the cars and helps customers with billing issues. Unlike AT&T;, the company does not partner with any third party for these services. “Our strategy is to do the entire ecosystem ourselves. It allows us to participate up and down the value chain,” said Goldman. Another sign of life for Verizon: Wireless carriers often sign deals not with an automaker as a whole, but for a particular make and model of a line of cars, leaving Verizon plenty of opportunities to score deals with automakers around the world. For example, AT&T;’s deal with Audi only encompasses the A3 and Q3 cars, leaving other Audi models up for grabs. Said Elizabeth Kerton executive director of the Autotech Council, which connects car companies with technologies and start ups: “I would not recommend AT&T; get lazy.”   (Additional reporting by Alina Selyukh in Las Vegas; Editing by Eric Effron and Hank Gilman)",9292014,http://www.reuters.com/article/connectedautos-wireless-verizon-comms/rpt-connected-cars-is-att-leaving-verizon-in-its-rear-view-mirror-idUSL2N0RU2BA20140929

769,VZ,U.S. delays plans to replace Healthcare.gov site host -WSJ,"Oct 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. government has shelved plans to move the HealthCare.gov insurance website to a new host, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. The decision represented “the best path forward to ensure a successful second open enrollment period. It was made in order to improve the consumer experience and have sufficient time for testing,” the journal reported, citing Aaron Albright, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The agency signed a contract last November to replace Verizon Communications Inc with Hewlett-Packard Co  as the host of the HealthCare.gov website. Verizon, which was blamed for the outages last year, has upgraded its servers and brought in additional staff to handle the load when open enrollment begins, the Journal said, citing people familiar with the situation. Albright also said the agency was taking other steps to manage peak traffic, including transferring around 75 percent of newcomers visiting the site to a portion hosted by Amazon Web Services. Testing so far suggested that the capacity for this portion of the site had grown significantly, but was still likely to be maxed out at certain points, forcing users into virtual “waiting rooms,” the Journal quoted one person familiar with the matter as saying.

772,VZ,Verizon posts higher revenue as consumers use more data,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc’s (VZ.N) quarterly revenue rose 4.3 percent, matching forecasts, as price cuts attracted more customers and growing mobile video traffic boosted data usage. Subscribers’ tendency to use more than one device, plugging in tablets and vehicle consoles to its network, also bolstered results. Postpaid customers connected nearly three devices per account, an increase of 3.7 percent. Verizon, the largest U.S. wireless carrier, added 1.5 million postpaid subscribers, or those who pay for service after use, beating Wall Street estimates of about 1 million customers. “Overall it was a good quarter for Verizon in terms of new additions. It is still a very competitive landscape and the fourth quarter could be challenging on a margin front as you look at a promotional period with a new iPhone,” said Angelo Zino, analyst at S&P; Capital IQ in New York. As subscribers watch more videos on their phones, the amount of data they consume is increasing. Customers on Verizon’s “More Everything” shared-data plan, which accounts for over one-half of its customers, are using 50 percent more data than a year ago.  “It is not just about a smartphone customer, it is about how we build a base of revenue,” Fran Shammo, chief financial officer, told investors on a conference call. Subscribers were also drawn to the carrier by cheaper prices. Verizon has been cautious in cutting prices in a hyper-competitive environment, but recently launched a series of promotions following reductions by rivals.  “Quite honestly, this puts us back in the market. Given all the pricing moves, we were quite honestly out of the market,” said Shammo.  The service margin for Verizon’s wireline sector fell 1.6 percent to 49.5 percent, pressured by equipment financing plans that have lower service fees. Increasing competition and lower prices are expected to squeeze margins across the telecom sector this quarter.  AT&T; (T.N) reports earnings on Wednesday, followed by Sprint (S.N) and T-Mobile TMUS.N next week. Recent price cuts and aggressive promotions has some investors worried the industry has entered a price war, as carriers compete for customers in a near saturated market.  In response, many wireless carriers have replaced traditional two-year contracts with equipment financing plans that charge lower service fees but do not subsidize devices.  But Verizon has been reluctant to dump the two-year contract. The carrier saw a tepid rise in customers subscribing to such plans in the most recent quarter but expects the percentage of those signing up to double in the fourth quarter.  Verizon reported third-quarter profit of 89 cents per share, up from 78 cents per share a year earlier but a penny shy of the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

778,VZ,UPDATE 2-U.S. delays 'incentive' airwaves auction to early 2016,"(Adds broadcasters’ response, November auction, details) By Alina Selyukh WASHINGTON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission expects a major auction of low-frequency airwaves to be pushed back to early 2016 from mid-2015 because of its complexity and a pending court challenge, an FCC official said in a blog post on Friday. The FCC is working on rules for the so-called incentive auction, in which wireless carriers would get the first opportunity since 2008 to purchase airwaves that are considered the “beach-front property” of radio spectrum for their reach and strength. The auction is regarded as the FCC’s most complex undertaking to date, balancing numerous economic, engineering and political considerations, including the need to woo broadcasters to give up the airwaves in the first place. The delay gives the FCC more time to sway TV station owners to participate and T-Mobile US Inc to argue for bidding restrictions on larger rivals AT&T; Inc and Verizon Communications Inc. The National Association of Broadcasters, concerned about the potential impact on TV stations, has petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review elements of the FCC’s planned auction process. The court has pushed back the deadline on final briefs in the case until late January 2015. “We are confident we will prevail in court, but given the reality of that schedule, the complexity of designing and implementing the auction, and the need for all auction participants to have certainty well in advance of the auction, we now anticipate accepting applications for the auction in the fall of 2015 and starting the auction in early 2016,” Gary Epstein, who chairs the FCC’s Incentive Auction Task Force, wrote in the blog post. The NAB rejected the notion that its lawsuit was the cause of the delay. “We look forward to a speedy resolution of our legal challenge and a successful auction that preserves access to free and local TV for every American,” NAB spokesman Dennis Wharton said in a statement. The FCC plans a road show this fall to convince TV station owners to participate in the auction, for example by going off the air or sharing frequencies with another station. Wireless carriers said the auction delay was unfortunate, but they added that they welcomed the effort to get it right. Although all large carriers are expected to participate, AT&T; so far has been the only one to pledge a specific amount, at least $9 billion. BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk, in a note, said the delay could “re-open the door for T-Mobile and Sprint to argue for more favorable bidding conditions, particularly given that they have abandoned their merger discussions.” Verizon, AT&T;, T-Mobile and satellite provider Dish Network Corp also plan to bid in the FCC’s AWS-3 auction, which is scheduled for Nov. 3. The anticipated start of the incentive auction was pushed back once before, to mid-2015 from 2014, because of its complexity.

779,VZ,Verizon reasserts no plans for Internet 'fast lanes',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc on Wednesday reasserted that it was not planning to strike any Internet “fast lane” deals that would help some websites load faster than others, in a letter to a top U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee lawmaker. The committee’s chairman, Sen. Patrick Leahy, last week wrote to top U.S. Internet service providers (ISPs) urging them to formally commit to no so-called “paid prioritization” deals in which content companies could pay ISPs to ensure smooth and fast delivery of their traffic.  Verizon on Wednesday wrote back, calling paid prioritization a “phantasm.” “As we have said before, and affirm again here, Verizon has no plans to engage in paid prioritization of Internet traffic,” Verizon’s general counsel Randal Milch said in the letter. “Unfortunately, the fever pitch over ‘paid prioritization’ and ‘fast lanes’ among advocates of greater Internet regulation is just demagoguery since no major ISP has expressed an interest in offering ‘paid prioritization’ and all agree that the FCC has a valid legal path to prohibit it.” The Federal Communications Commission has received almost 4 million comments after it proposed new web traffic, or “net neutrality,” rules that would prohibit ISPs from blocking content, but suggested allowing some “commercially reasonable” paid prioritization deals.  Other Large ISPs, including Comcast and AT&T;, have been asserting that they had no plans for such paid prioritization arrangements and FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has said he would not tolerate anti-competitive or anti-consumer prioritization deals. Nonetheless, consumer advocates and other critics are concerned that opening the door for paid prioritization could create “fast lanes” for some content and so relegate other websites and applications to “slow lanes.”  What some critics have instead requested is for the FCC to reclassify ISPs so they are regulated more like public utilities, which the broadband companies say will hamper investments and innovation. In its letter on Wednesday, Verizon argued that the FCC has other legal options to prevent harmful paid prioritization without needing to resort to reclassification of ISPs. The FCC is writing new net neutrality rules after a U.S. appeals court in January struck down their previous version in a case brought by Verizon.  The 2010 net neutrality rules allowed “commercially reasonable” discrimination of traffic, but indicated that the FCC would disapprove of potential “pay-for-priority” deals.

The FCC is writing new net neutrality rules after a U.S. appeals court in January struck down their previous version in a case brought by Verizon. The 2010 net neutrality rules allowed “commercially reasonable” discrimination of traffic, but indicated that the FCC would disapprove of potential “pay-for-priority” deals.

781,VZ,Wireless calls between Verizon and AT&T; to be carried on data network by 2015,"WASHINGTON, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications  and AT&T; Inc expect to be able to transmit wireless voice calls between the two carriers over high-speed data networks by 2015, the companies said on Monday. The technology is expected to improve the quality of calls and allow for video calling and voicemail. The calls would be transmitted using a technology known as Voice over LTE, which repackages voice calls as data and transmits them over carriers’ high-speed data networks. Carriers currently transmit most voice calls on older 2G networks, while data is sent through high-speed 4G networks. “Interoperability among all VoLTE providers takes connectivity to the next level with HD quality voice and additional features that customers want,” Tony Melone, chief technology officer at Verizon, said in a statement. AT&T; and T-Mobile began rolling out Voice over LTE in select cities earlier this year. Verizon announced a nationwide launch in September, but customers cannot yet call subscribers on other networks using the technology. The technology could also allow customers to purchase devices that are not bound to a particular carrier and can easily be transferred to a different network. “Customers expect to be able to connect anywhere, anytime - and as LTE technology continues to evolve, it’s imperative that we provide a seamless experience between carriers,”  Krish Prabhu, president, AT&T; Labs and AT&T; chief technology officer, said in a statement. For wireless carriers, Voice over LTE will help them to use their network resources more efficiently by allowing them to dump old voice network infrastructure and free up wireless spectrum currently used for voice calls.

782,VZ,REFILE-UPDATE 2-AT&T; to pause fiber spending on net neutrality uncertainty,"(In seventh paragraph, corrects day of week of White House blog  post to Monday from Wednesday) By Marina Lopes WASHINGTON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - AT&T; Inc on Wednesday raised pressure on the U.S. telecom regulator’s work on new “net neutrality” rules, saying it would stop investing in new high-speed Internet connections in 100 U.S. cities until the Web traffic rules are settled. The statement from AT&T; Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson is the first business move by an Internet service provider in response to President Barack Obama’s unexpected call on the Federal Communications Commission on Monday to regulate such companies more like public utilities. The statement came as AT&T; has been spending heavily on acquisitions and days after it had cut its capital spending estimate for 2015. The industry and Republican lawmakers have been protesting Obama’s proposal, saying stricter Internet traffic regulations would stifle growth and investment. “We can’t go out and invest that kind of money deploying fiber to 100 cities not knowing under what rules those investments will be governed,” Stephenson said at an analyst conference. In April, AT&T; said it would deploy its high-speed fiber network in 100 cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami. Ensuring access to quality Internet for all Americans has been the FCC’s major focus. The White House detailed Obama’s plan in a blog post on Monday, saying that if implemented, it “shouldn’t create any new burden for Internet providers.” Telecommunications companies plan to fight Obama’s call for utility-style regulations in Congress and the courts. More than three dozen congressional Republicans on Wednesday wrote to FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler that Obama’s proposed regulatory changes were “beyond the scope of the FCC’s authority.” AT&T;, whose $48.5 billion bid for DirecTV is under government review, said on Friday that it would also pay $1.7 billion to acquire Mexican wireless operator Iusacell. It trimmed its 2015 capital spending outlook to $18 billion from $21 billion. At the same conference on Wednesday, Verizon Communications Inc Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo struck a somewhat lighter tone but also said the FCC could restrict “paid prioritization” deals, where content companies pay for faster downloads of some websites or applications, without pursuing utility-style regulations. “I think the independent agency of the FCC will make the right decision,” Shammo said.

783,VZ,UPDATE 2-AT&T; downplays America Movil assets as clock ticks,"(Recasts with details from Verizon, analyst comment) By Christine Murray and Marina Lopes MEXICO CITY/WASHINGTON Nov 12 (Reuters) - AT&T; Inc, seen as a frontrunner to buy some Mexican assets of billionaire Carlos Slim’s America Movil, said on Wednesday it can succeed in Mexico without doing so, possibly putting Slim’s timetable for a deal in jeopardy. Slim said in July that six months to offload assets of Mexico’s largest wireless operator would be “slow”, but four months later, on the same day AT&T; downplayed interest, Verizon  said it has no interest in acquisitions in Mexico. Vodafone also has said it is unlikely to look at what Slim is offering. Other carriers have been linked to the deal, including Japan’s Softbank, but none have admitted to holding talks. In a recent analyst call, America Movil  executives said they were “not in a hurry to do the sale”. The longer the deal takes, the longer the company is subject to tough antitrust regulations including zero interconnection rates and forced infrastructure sharing, which are already affecting its results. America Movil, which has 70 percent of Mexico’s mobiles and more than 60 percent of fixed lines, said it would sell assets to cut market share and avoid the rules. But AT&T;, which had been seen by many analysts as the most likely buyer, said its $1.7 billion purchase of No.3 carrier Iusacell would allow it to compete without Slim’s assets. “We believe we have found a path that gets us a nice scalable growth platform without the America Movil assets,” AT&T; Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said. “If things materialize over time and those assets look attractive we would obviously have to look at them, but we really don’t need the America Movil assets to be successful.” The comments sent America Movil shares down 2.5 percent. Instead, AT&T; could buy No.4 carrier Nextel, which has around 2.8 million subscribers and whose parent, NII Holdings , is going through a bankruptcy process. Stephenson said Nextel has Mexican assets AT&T; would find attractive, sending shares in NII Holdings up more than 17 percent. Citigroup analysts said on Monday Nextel has valuable spectrum in the 800 MHz band that could be used to develop a 4G LTE network. Officials at Nextel and America Movil declined comment.

786,VZ,China blocks websites ahead of high-profile Internet forum: group,"BEIJING (Reuters) - The Chinese government has blocked access to a swathe of websites in what an internet monitoring group said on Tuesday was a blunt censorship campaign days before the country plays host to a major internet industry conference. Greatfire.org, a group that conducts research on Chinese internet censorship, said the Chinese government appears to have targeted a network operated by Edgecast, a subsidiary of Verizon Communications Inc that delivers content and services for web companies, rather than specific web addresses. Greatfire.org has used Edgecast to host “mirror sites” that redirect users to otherwise censored websites like YouTube. Edgecast customers that may have been affected include The Atlantic magazine’s website and Mozilla, which uses Edgecast to deliver plug-in services for its Firefox browser, the monitoring group said. In a statement, Edgecast said there were disruptions to its operations in China. “We have put policies in place to help our customers mitigate the effects of this most recent filtering but expect this to be an ongoing issue for our customers seeking to reach Chinese users,” the California-based company said. The information office of China’s State Council, or cabinet, did not immediately respond to a fax seeking comment. From Wednesday, China will host the World Internet Conference in eastern Zhejiang Province, an event designed to showcase China’s rising standing in the global technology industry and its positions on internet governance issues. The event is being organized by China’s newly formed Cyberspace Administration and will draw Chinese policymakers and top industry executives including the chief executives of China’s biggest tech companies Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, Tencent Holdings and Baidu Inc. Lu Wei, the head of the Cyberspace Administration, has repeatedly defended internet censorship, saying it was critical to protect China’s interests. In a statement this week, human rights watchdog Amnesty International said the internet conference was part of the Chinese government’s efforts to influence global cyberspace rules and “a further sign that internet freedom is under a sustained attack”.

789,VZ,Fitch Rates Verizon's Sr. Unsecured Notes 'A-'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 24 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to  Verizon Communications Inc.'s (NYSE: -VZ) offering of EUR1.4 billion of 1.625%  senior unsecured notes due 2024 and EUR1 billion of 2.625% senior unsecured  notes due 2031. VZ plans to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes,  which may include the acquisition of spectrum licenses, and if market and other  conditions permit, the repayment of debt. Fitch currently rates VZ's Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) 'A-' with a Stable Rating Outlook. KEY RATING DRIVERS --The February 2014 acquisition of the remaining Verizon Wireless (VZW) stake  has pressured VZ's recent credit metrics, pushing pro forma leverage at closing  to approximately 2.6x. Actual gross leverage at Sept. 30, 2014 was 2.5x, with  total debt at $109.2 billion. Fitch expects VZ to materially reduce debt over  the next few years. This, combined with EBITDA growth, is expected to reduce  leverage to around 2x by the end of 2016, a level more appropriate for an 'A-'  rating. The precise timing of the reduction in leverage is subject to some  uncertainty, given the potential for spending in upcoming auctions for wireless  spectrum, a portion of which Fitch expects to be initially debt-funded. --Fitch believes metrics will return to a level appropriate for the rating in  the 2016/2017 timeframe due to VZ's strong position in the wireless industry and  the significant cash flows generated by the wireless business. This is in  combination with VZ management's commitment to delever, which has been  demonstrated in the past as evidenced by the aggressive delevering following the  acquisition of Alltel Corporation in early 2009. --A key to debt reduction over the next several years will be the continued  generation of strong free cash flow (FCF) at VZW. VZW's simple FCF (EBITDA less  capital spending) for the latest 12 months (LTM) ending Sept. 30, 2014 was  approximately $25.4 billion. Owing to the acquisition of the remaining VZW  stake, Fitch estimates VZ's FCF (after dividends and capital spending) will be  in the $4 billion to $6 billion range in 2014 as a result of transaction-related  interest costs, higher dividend requirements due to the shares issued to  Vodafone equity holders, and higher cash taxes. --VZW's strong competitive position, evidenced by industry-low churn rates on  average, high margins, and the most developed LTE network in the U.S. support  Fitch's expectations that VZ will maintain cash flow stability and support the  longer rating horizon for leverage metrics to return to levels consistent with  the rating. VZ's liquidity is supported by its reported consolidated cash balances, which  were $7.2 billion at Sept. 30, 2014, and by its revolving credit facility (RCF).  In July, Verizon amended its RCF to to $8 billion from $6.2 billion and extended  the maturity to July 2018 from August 2017. Fitch expects VZ to maintain  aggregate commercial paper (CP) balances within a level fully backed by the RCF.  The credit facility has no ratings triggers or other restrictive covenants, such  as leverage or interest coverage tests. On a consolidated basis, VZ and its subsidiaries have no material debt  maturities in 2014, and approximately $2.6 billion in 2015. In 2014, Fitch expects consolidated capital spending to be approximately $17  billion, slightly higher than the $16.6 billion spent in 2013. Investment in the  wireless network continues to be an area of emphasis due to the strong demand  for 4G LTE capacity for rapidly growing data services. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch believes a positive rating action is unlikely in the foreseeable future,  given the leverage incurred in the Vodafone transaction. Conversely, Fitch may take negative rating action if operating performance  causes deleveraging to take place at a materially slower than anticipated pace,  either alone or in combination with spending on spectrum through 2016. Fitch  estimates that even with some moderation in revenue growth and margin pressure  Verizon could spend up to $15 billion on spectrum before pressuring the rating.  Discretionary management moves that cause leverage to rise above 2.5x, such as  another material acquisition or stock repurchases, could lead to a negative  action in the absence of a strong commitment to delever.

790,VZ,Boston Verizon FiOS subscribers lose access to local Fox channel,"(Reuters) - Boston-area Verizon customers found themselves cut off from one kind of Thanksgiving bird on Thursday: the Eagles football team. Subscribers to Verizon Communications Inc’s FiOS cable TV over fiber network service in Boston lost access to Fox’s local affiliate station due to a fee dispute with Cox Media Group, which owns the station, according to a Verizon email to customers. That meant the subscribers woke up on Thanksgiving Day unable to watch Thursday’s National Football League game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Philadelphia Eagles.  Unhappy subscribers tweeted their disappointment. Using the name “laurie bouzan,” one user wrote: “Verizon/Boston Fox 25 can’t reach deal and no service to customers. Corporate greediness on Thanksgiving Day!”     Verizon said that Cox removed WFXT TV, the local affiliate of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s Fox TV network, and the WFXT Movies station from its FiOS TV network because it refused to accept an agreement “that contained rates that are not in our customers’ best interests.” Verizon said it was working with Cox to renew their agreement and restore the affected channels. The company was playing a 30-second video loop on Fox channels in which a woman said: “We are working hard to get this channel back at a reasonable price. Cox-owned WFXT wants millions more in fees, which will ultimately mean higher costs for our customers. Don’t you think you are paying enough for TV?” Fox and Cox Media Group were not immediately available for comment. In a statement online, Verizon said that it is “diligently negotiating with Cox for a retransmission deal that will be fair and reasonable for our customers.” Recently, CBS Corp and satellite operator Dish Network Corp avoided a blackout of CBS TV shows and its heavily watched Thanksgiving Day NFL game as the two sides agreed to extend a deadline into next week to try to hash out the details of a new contract.

Adding to the cautious tone was uncertainty over whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will change its pledge to keep rates near zero for a “considerable time” when policymakers meet next week. U.S. telecom stocks led losses on the S&P; 500 and Dow on concerns about an industry price war. Verizon Communications  warned that promotions in its wireless business would bite into its fourth-quarter profit.

797,VZ,U.S. manufacturers group opposes stricter Internet regulations,"WASHINGTON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. National Association of Manufacturers on Wednesday wrote to congressional and Federal Communications Commission leaders to oppose potential stricter regulations for Internet service providers. The FCC is working on new rules that would dictate Internet service providers’ freedom to manage web traffic on their networks, aiming to ensure that ISPs do not discriminate against any content in ways that could harm competition or consumers. President Barack Obama last month urged the FCC to set the strictest rules possible to protect net neutrality, the principle that all Internet traffic should be treated equally. For that, he suggested a legal pathway that would reclassify Internet service so it is regulated like a utility, which telecom and cable companies vehemently protest. “Current proposals to regulate the Internet with early 20th Century-era laws severely threaten continued growth... We urge you to oppose any efforts to unnecessarily regulate the open Internet,” more than 100 members of the NAM wrote to FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler and Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Though business groups NAM and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have both previously submitted comments to the FCC opposing utility-style Internet regulations, Wednesday’s letter illustrates the heated and multifaceted political battle brewing for the FCC’s new rules, expected next year. Internet providers Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T; Inc are among 14,000 members of the manufacturers’ association. The NAM letter’s signatories included packaging company Ball Corp, tools and hardware maker Stanley Black & Decker Inc, auto technology and parts company Tenneco Inc , thermal equipment maker Modine Manufacturing Co  and industrial conglomerate Emerson Electric Co. The letter also went to Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker, National Economic Council Director Jeffrey Zients and Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Jason Furman. “The Internet and technology is a critical tool for manufacturers to grow their business,” NAM Technology Policy President Brian Raymond said in an interview. “(Our members) get concerned if the government is going to slow down their business in any way and they see this as one of those ways.” Raymond cited as one worrying indicator AT&T;’s recent warning that it will pause investments in new high-speed Internet connections until net neutrality rules are settled. “Whenever there’s a pause in investment by any kind of company due to regulatory uncertainty, it’s going to have a trickle-down effect on the whole manufacturing community,” he said.

Shares of the company, which tests ethernet networks, 3G and 4G wireless networks and devices, rose as much as 14 percent on Thursday, making them one of the top gainers on the London Stock Exchange. Verizon Communications Inc overtook AT&T; Inc  and Cisco Systems Inc as Spirent’s No.1 customer, as the telecoms company’s recent acquisitions helped keep orders steady in an industry that was cutting spending, Chief Executive Eric Hutchinson told Reuters. Hutchinson said Spirent also benefited from more business from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and from service providers and equipment manufacturers in China. The company, which had warned in November that weak market conditions in the third quarter would stay for the rest of 2014, estimated full-year 2014 revenue at about $455 million, a 10 percent jump from a year earlier. Spirent said on Thursday that fourth-quarter order intake rose nearly 13 percent to about $147 million, with revenue of about $124 million, at the upper end of its expectations. Orders from the Americas grew 7 percent in the year, while those from the Asia-Pacific region rose 5 percent, Chief Financial Officer Rachel Whiting told Reuters. The United States accounted for 50 percent of Spirent’s 2013 revenue, while Asia-Pacific contributed about 35 percent. AT&T;’s said in November it would cut spending in 2015, one of many such decisions by telecom companies over the past few months in an industry grappling with potential merger activity and assessing new technology deployments. CEO Hutchinson said orders from two large clients and some equipment makers had reduced by as much as $30 million in 2014. Spirent shares were up 10.8 percent at 87.25 pence at 1320 GMT.

807,VZ,U.S. regulator wants faster speeds for Internet broadband,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. FCC on Wednesday proposed raising the definition of the high-speed Internet to downloads at 25 megabits per second (Mbps), a more than a six-fold increase from the current standard. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler’s  proposal would also require a minimum 3 Mbps upload speed to qualify as broadband, according to a fact sheet shared with Reuters. U.S. telecommunications law gives the FCC the authority to regulate Internet service providers (ISPs) such as Verizon Communications Inc, Comcast Corp and AT&T; Inc  as the agency oversees the roll-out of broadband services to all Americans “in a reasonable and timely fashion.” If the proposed changes are taken into account, the current access to broadband is not meeting that standard, the document showed, opening the door to potential FCC intervention. Wheeler on Wednesday also circulated to fellow commissioners a so-called “notice of inquiry” asking what actions the FCC could take to accelerate broadband deployment.

809,VZ,U.S. regulator wants faster speeds for Internet broadband,"WASHINGTON, Jan 7 (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. FCC on Wednesday proposed raising the definition of the high-speed Internet to downloads at 25 megabits per second (Mbps), a more than a six-fold increase from the current standard. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler’s  proposal would also require a minimum 3 Mbps upload speed to qualify as broadband, according to a fact sheet shared with Reuters. U.S. telecommunications law gives the FCC the authority to regulate Internet service providers (ISPs) such as Verizon Communications Inc, Comcast Corp and AT&T; Inc  as the agency oversees the roll-out of broadband services to all Americans “in a reasonable and timely fashion.” If the proposed changes are taken into account, the current access to broadband is not meeting that standard, the document showed, opening the door to potential FCC intervention. Wheeler on Wednesday also circulated to fellow commissioners a so-called “notice of inquiry” asking what actions the FCC could take to accelerate broadband deployment. The FCC currently defines broadband, or high-speed Internet, as 4 Mbps download speed and 1 Mbps upload speed, which Wheeler has decried as too slow for the modern needs of U.S. consumers. Consumers are increasingly using the Internet to stream music and videos, make calls or use other services that demand faster speeds.

810,VZ,Verizon launches 'connected car' product for older vehicles,"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc unveiled an Internet and wireless car service on Tuesday that lets drivers of older cars get help during a breakdown or find out about repairs and maintenance that might be needed. The wireless company said at the Detroit auto show that it will make its “Verizon Vehicle” service available in the second quarter of this year. The subscription-based service will work on models dating back to 1996. The monthly service charge for Verizon’s new product aimed at modernizing older cars is $15, said Erik Goldman, president of Verizon Telematics.  The service is intended to help drivers of older cars, who can opt to receive alerts via text, call, smartphone notifications or email. Other features allow drivers to diagnose mechanical problems, talk to car mechanics in real time and access help in an emergency. “There’s a lot of talk of the value of vehicles being connected in the market today but unfortunately there is a number of vehicles, roughly 200 million, that don’t have the availability of those services,” Goldman said in an interview. “Even if you buy a new car today there are great services with various service providers but you’re tied to one manufacturer.” ",1132015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-autoshow-verizon-comms/verizon-launches-connected-car-product-for-older-vehicles-idUSKBN0KM26C20150113

The ECB will buy 60 billion euros worth of assets per month, more than markets had been hoping for, in a program that will last through September 2016. Shares in Europe jumped 1.6 percent to close at a seven-year high. Analysts said that, while traders applauded the ECB’s decision, many questions remain about the strength of euro zone activity. “Many have said this program is not going to suddenly flip a switch,” said John Canally, investment strategist at LPL Financial in Boston. “It’s a long slog and this is the first step.” At 3:17 p.m. EST (2017 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  rose 282.53 points, or 1.61 percent, to 17,836.81, the S&P; 500 gained 32.08 points, or 1.58 percent, to 2,064.2 and the Nasdaq Composite added 83.84 points, or 1.8 percent, to 4,751.26. After trading lower in the morning and at midday on an unexpectedly high increase in oil stockpiling, the S&P; 500 energy sector moved into positive territory by mid-afternoon and was recently up 0.4 percent. Financial firms led gains on Thursday boosted by the ECB move, as the S&P; 500 financials ticked up 2.6 percent. Wells Fargo and Bank of America rose 2.9 percent and 4.9 percent, respectively. Verizon Communications was the largest points weight on the S&P; 500, down 1.2 percent to $47.65 after swinging to a net loss in its latest quarter. The stock weighed on both the Dow and on telecom stocks , which were by far the weakest S&P; 500 sector of the day, down 0.7 percent. American Express Co also weighed on the Dow, falling 2.3 percent to $85.6, a day after it said it would cut more than 4,000 jobs this year as expenses and provisions for bad loans rose. F5 Networks Inc slumped 11.2 percent to $111.90. The network equipment maker’s revenue missed expectations for the first time in eight quarters. It also forecast current-quarter revenue and profit below estimates.

814,VZ,CORRECTED-UPDATE 3-Verizon posts higher revenue; wireless margins narrow,"Jan 22 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc said on Thursday that quarterly revenue rose 6.8 percent as it added more customers during the competitive holiday season but profit margins narrowed in its wireless business due to pricing and promotions. Shares in Verizon fell 2.5 percent to $47.06 on the New York Stock Exchange, while the S&P; Telecom Services Sector  fell 1.8 percent. Verizon earned 71 cents per share, excluding items, in the fourth quarter, as revenue rose to $33.19 billion from $31.07 billion. The profit per share matched Wall Street estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, while revenues came in slightly above expectations of $32.69 billion. The largest U.S wireless company added 2 million postpaid subscribers, or those who pay for service after use, topping the 1.5 million subscribers added in the last quarter. “The real question here is ... do they have to potentially more aggressively reprice their existing base as we go through 2015 because of competitive pressures,” Mike McCormack, an analyst at Jefferies & Co, said. Investors are concerned the ongoing price wars to attract and keep customers could come at the cost of growth in a nearly saturated wireless market. In 2015, Verizon will continue to go “after that high-value, high-quality network user who is going to pay a premium for that network and we’re not just going to compete on price,” Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said in an interview. Verizon’s retail postpaid average revenue per account rose to $158.82 from $157.21, but was below the $161.64 estimated by analysts polled by research firm StreetAccount. Profit margins in its wireless business narrowed to 42 percent in the quarter from 47 percent a year ago. “Verizon is the best house in a bad neighborhood,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. “You’re seeing for the first time the old measure that is average revenue per user starting to fall.” Customer defections, known as churn, in postpaid accounts rose to 1.4 percent. Verizon had said it expected to see the churn rate elevate in the fourth quarter. Some wireless carriers have replaced traditional two-year contracts with equipment financing plans that allow payments in monthly installments. The plans charge lower service fees but do not subsidize devices. Verizon posted a 25 percent rise in customers adopting its no-subsidy “EDGE” plan for upgrading devices. Verizon, however, reported a net loss of $2.23 billion, or 54 cents per share, attributable to the company for the fourth quarter compared with a profit of $5.07 billion, or $1.76 per share, a year earlier, mainly due to valuation of benefits plan and pension adjustments.

821,VZ,Verizon to pay $5 million for problems with calls to U.S. rural areas,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc will pay a $2 million fine and spend $3 million on compliance programs to settle a government inquiry into calls not going through to some customers in rural areas, U.S. regulators said on Monday. The Federal Communications Commission investigated whether Verizon, the largest U.S. telephone company, in 2013 failed to look into why long-distance and wireless calls were not going through to landline phones in 26 rural areas.  “All Americans, no matter where they are located, have a right to make and receive phone calls,” FCC Enforcement Bureau Chief Travis LeBlanc said in a statement.  “Phone companies are on notice that the FCC will hold them accountable for failures to investigate and ensure that calls go through to the rural heartland of the country.” Though the FCC said it had significant concerns with Verizon’s actions, the regulator urged other companies to take advantage of the workshops and other efforts to improve call service in rural areas that Verizon will offer as part of the settlement. Verizon will spend $3 million in the next three years to develop a system for automatic identification of rural call completion complaints, monitor call answer rates, hold workshops and sponsor an academic study on ways of detecting and resolving rural call problems. Verizon spokesman Ed McFadden said the company’s long-distance networks were highly reliable and it has worked proactively with the FCC and industry partners.  “Verizon will reach out to rural carriers and will do additional analyses to confirm proper delivery of calls to rural destinations,” he said. “This approach will help promote comprehensive, industry-wide solutions.” ",1262015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-verizon-comms-fcc/verizon-to-pay-5-million-for-problems-with-calls-to-u-s-rural-areas-idUSKBN0KZ2E520150126

824,VZ,UPDATE 1-U.S. govt unveils goal to move Medicare away from fee-for-service,"(Adds details on employers, Wall Street,  stakeholders, background) By David Morgan WASHINGTON, Jan 26 (Reuters) - The Obama administration on Monday unveiled an ambitious plan to control health costs by moving the $2.9 trillion U.S. health systems away from costly fee-for-service medicine, beginning with the Medicare program for the elderly and disabled. By the end of 2018, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell told reporters that 50 percent of traditional Medicare’s $362 billion in annual payments would go to doctors, hospitals and other providers that participate in alternative payment models which emphasize cost containment and quality of care. Officials, who hope to see the initiative matched by private insurers, employers and state Medicaid programs for the poor, said the move was intended to head off a resurgence in healthcare cost growth from an historically low 3.6 percent in 2013 to a projected 6.6 percent in 2020. The administration announced its goals after Burwell met with private and public sector stakeholders including insurers, consumer and provider groups and employers Boeing Co and Verizon Communications Inc. Wall Street analysts said for-profit hospitals and private insurers would be well positioned to benefit from a new shift toward lower-cost care delivery. Groups representing doctors and hospitals said the move could mean greater flexibility for their members in determining care delivery, while consumer representatives said the unprecedented goals could boost the quality of care. About 20 percent of traditional Medicare payments, a sum worth $72 billion, currently go to providers with cost-saving business models. The remainder are based on fee-for-service payments that reward providers for the volume of care they provide. Fee-for-service has been blamed by policymakers for promoting higher costs, mediocre care and unnecessary procedures. The administration’s goals would be phased in by first increasing the participation of alternative care models to 30 percent of Medicare payments by the end of 2016. Officials described the 50 percent goal for 2018 as a “tipping point” that could help make payment reform mainstream across the U.S. health system. Within four years, the administration expects all but 10 percent of traditional Medicare to be linked to new quality and efficiency standards, including most of the remaining fee-for- service providers. The government has also been experimenting with payment models that officials say have generated $417 million in savings to Medicare. But the effort could face long odds. New care models have shown limited progress in controlling costs and little evidence of being able to sustain cost savings.

826,VZ,Cablevision to launch WiFi phone service for data-hungry users,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Cablevision System Corp said on Monday it would launch in February a wireless Internet phone service to give users an alternative to pricier data plans from cellular companies such as AT&T; and Verizon. The “Freewheel” phone service, which runs on any WiFi connection, is an attempt by Cablevision to retain and potentially add subscribers at a time when cable companies are losing out to lower-priced, bundled TV and Internet services from telecom firms. Cablevision said the phone service was the first of its kind to be launched by a cable company and aims to tap users seeking to download unlimited amounts of data on their mobile phones using WiFi, which is less expensive than a cellular connection. Such services could pose a challenge to traditional telecom carriers. Currently, carrier Republic Wireless and Massachusetts-based startup Scratch Wireless offer users similar services that use WiFi to control data costs.  “There has been a dramatic shift in how consumers use their mobile devices: today, it’s all about data, and WiFi is now preferred and clearly superior to cellular,” Kristin Dolan, chief operating officer of Cablevision, said in the statement. Cablevision, controlled by New York’s Dolan family, has been investing in its “Optimum” WiFi network since 2007, setting up over 1.1 million WiFi hotspots or access points in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Cablevision’s WiFi phone service will be offered at $29.95 per month and $9.95 per month for subscribers of its “Optimum Online” service. It will be available exclusively on the Motorola Moto G smartphone that users will have to purchase, the company said.

828,VZ,UPDATE 3-U.S. wireless spectrum auction raises record $44.9 billion,"(Adds FCC chairman statement, details) By Alina Selyukh and Malathi Nayak WASHINGTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission raised a record $44.9 billion in the auction of so-called AWS-3 airwaves that closed on Thursday, marking the highest point yet in the wireless industry’s appetite for more spectrum. Wireless carriers Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T; Inc and T-Mobile US Inc, satellite TV provider Dish Network Corp and others vied for new slices of airwaves to satisfy the growing consumer demand for streaming video and other data-guzzling applications. Regulators will disclose the winners of the auctioned spectrum licenses in the coming days. The auction presented the largest opportunity for companies to buy new wireless spectrum since 2008. But it shattered the expectations of analysts and the FCC, barrelling past the reserve price of $10.1 billion in the first week of bidding and more than doubling the haul of the biggest previous auction. “By their actions, wireless carriers have demonstrated the importance of new spectrum,” FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler told reporters on Thursday as he received congratulations from lawmakers and industry executives. The proceeds will pay for a new $7 billion public safety network and boost the Treasury’s coffers. Wheeler cited one forecast that the new spectrum might boost U.S. GDP by billions and add tens of thousands of new jobs. The auction will also be important to Dish, which already owns similar airwaves whose value will now be crystallized for the first time. Its shares had hit an all-time peak during the course of the auction and rose 3.1 percent to $73.75 on Thursday afternoon. The FCC now looks to 2016, when it plans to hold its largest and most complex auction yet of the low-frequency airwaves which are highly coveted for their strength and reach. Sprint Corp , which sat out the AWS-3 auction, is expected to join other bidders in that planned auction. Investors have worried that AT&T; and Verizon may have overspent in the AWS-3 auction, but analysts argue that more spectrum will help carriers expand their network capacity as they tackle intense competition in the near saturated wireless market. Based on their debt-raising patterns, AT&T; may have purchased more than Verizon, said Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research. He expects AT&T; to pay between $20 billion to $22 billion and Verizon to spend in the range of $14 billion to $16 billion in the auction. Canada’s government plans to auction off similar AWS-3 airwaves in March.

AT&T; bid a total of $18.2 billion to win licenses of so-called AWS-3 spectrum. Dish itself did not win any licenses, but had invested in bidding partners SNR Wireless LicenseCo LLC and Northstar Wireless LLC, which bid a total of $13.3 billion. The two companies, backed also by financial firms including BlackRock Inc but with little to no revenue, had applied to receive a discount as small-business entities, bringing their net bid amount to $10 billion. Verizon and T-Mobile bids were $10.4 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, according to the results of the Federal Communications Commission’s largest ever auction. “Dish was the one that surprised most, spending a couple of billion more than anticipated,” said Jefferies & Co analyst Mike McCormack. Dish’s larger-than-expected bid for over 700 licenses put a damper on the investors’ hypothesis that the satellite company had expected to turn around and sell the newly acquired airwaves to Verizon or another buyer. However, Dish’s plans remain unclear. Shares of Dish fell 4.3 percent to close at $70.35 on Thursday. Verizon made slightly lower-than-expected bids but the company had hinted to investors that it would do so in December, McCormack added. The record $44.9 billion auction, which ended on Thursday, demonstrated the voracious appetite of wireless carriers and other companies for spectrum to satisfy the growing consumer demand to stream video and other data-guzzling content. AT&T;, Dish’s partners and Verizon snapped up airwaves in some of the most coveted and expensive markets, such as New York and California. Verizon and AT&T; shares were relatively unchanged before closing at $45.71 and $32.92, respectively.

Verizon said in a statement it bought a total of 181 licenses that cover markets reaching 61 percent of the United States. AT&T; was awarded 251 licenses, while T-Mobile bagged 151 licenses.

The planned sales include cellphone towers and parts of its landline phone business, the WSJ reported. (on.wsj.com/1Akj7ct) As Verizon focuses on updating its network, the company would consider selling cellphone towers if it found an attractive deal, chief executive Lowell McAdam said on a January call with investors. “There are certain assets on the wireline side that we think would be better off in somebody else’s hands so we can focus our energy in a little bit more narrow geography,” McAdam said. Divesting assets could also help Verizon repurchase some shares it issued after it announced the Vodafone deal, he added.

838,VZ,Fitch: Verizon's 'A-' Rating Not Affected by Spectrum Bidding,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 02 (Fitch) On Jan. 30, 2015, the Federal Communications  Commission (FCC) announced the winning bidders in the AWS-3 spectrum action.  Verizon Communications Inc.'s (Verizon; NYSE: VZ) total winning bids amounted to  approximately $10.4 billion. This amount was well under the level which would  have triggered a negative rating action ($15 billion) by Fitch. In Fitch's view,  Verizon's ratings (Issuer Default Rating and senior unsecured debt of  'A-') and Stable Outlook are unaffected by this action. Although Verizon has not disclosed detailed funding plans to pay for the  spectrum, Fitch does not expect Verizon to have significant debt funding needs,  as its consolidated cash balances were $10.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2014. In  addition to cash, the company has an $8 billion revolving credit facility (RCF).  Verizon's total net remaining payment is $9.5 billion, net of a $0.9 billion  upfront downpayment made prior to the start of the auction in November 2014,  with approximately $1.2 billion due February 13 and the final balance due March  2. Verizon will acquire 181 licenses, covering a population of 192 million, or 61%  of the U.S. The spectrum enhances Verizon's relatively deep existing AWS  spectrum portfolio, which was built in the 2006 AWS spectrum auction and through  acquisitions, including 2012 acquisitions of spectrum from cable companies. KEY RATING DRIVERS --The February 2014 acquisition of the remaining Verizon Wireless (VZW) stake  has pressured Verizon's recent credit metrics, pushing pro forma leverage at  closing to approximately 2.6x. Gross leverage at Dec. 31, 2014 was 2.6x, with  total debt at $113.3 billion. Net leverage was approximately 2.3x, and  incorporates cash built in anticipation of potential spectrum funding; cash  stood at $10.6 billion at year-end. --Going forward, Fitch expects Verizon to materially reduce debt over the next  few years. Debt reduction, combined with EBITDA growth, is expected to reduce  leverage to a level appropriate for the rating in the 2016/2017 timeframe as a  result of Verizon's strong position in the wireless industry and the significant  cash flows generated by the wireless business. This is in combination with  Verizon management's commitment to delever, which has been demonstrated in the  past as evidenced by the aggressive delevering following the acquisition of  Alltel Corporation in early 2009. --A key to debt reduction over the next several years will be the continued  generation of strong free cash flow (FCF) at VZW. VZW's simple FCF (EBITDA less  capital spending) for 2014 was approximately $24.7 billion. Owing to the  acquisition of the remaining VZW stake, Verizon's FCF (after dividends and  capital spending) was affected by transaction-related interest costs, higher  dividend requirements due to the shares issued to Vodafone equity holders, and  higher cash taxes. Despite these factors, 2014 FCF of $6 billion was at the high  end of Fitch's estimated range of $4 billion to $6 billion. --VZW's strong competitive position, evidenced by industry-low churn rates on  average, high margins, and the most developed LTE network in the U.S., support  Fitch's expectations that Verizon will maintain cash flow stability and support  the longer rating horizon for leverage metrics to return to levels consistent  with the rating. Verizon's liquidity is supported by its reported consolidated cash balances,  which were $10.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2014, and by its RCF. The $8 billion RCF  matures in July 2018. Fitch expects Verizon to maintain aggregate commercial  paper (CP) balances within a level fully backed by the RCF. The credit facility  has no rating triggers or other restrictive covenants, such as leverage or  interest coverage tests. On a consolidated basis, Verizon and its subsidiaries have maturities of  approximately $2.6 billion in 2015. In 2015, Fitch expects consolidated capital spending to be approximately $17.8  billion, slightly higher than the $17.2 billion spent in 2014. Investment in the  wireless network continues to be an area of emphasis due to the strong demand  for 4G LTE capacity for rapidly growing data services. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch believes a positive rating action is unlikely in the foreseeable future,  given the leverage incurred in the Vodafone transaction. Conversely, Fitch may take negative rating action if operating performance  causes delevering to take place at a materially slower than anticipated pace,  either alone or in combination with material debt-financed acquisitions.  Discretionary management moves that cause leverage to rise above 2.5x, such as  another material acquisition or stock repurchases, could lead to a negative  action in the absence of a strong commitment to delever.

The companies did a similar deal in 2009, when Verizon sold 4.8 million rural phone lines to Frontier for $8.6 billion in stock and cash, to do away with that business and focus on wireless and broadband services. A Verizon spokesman declined to comment while a representative for Frontier could not be reached. Verizon purchased 181 licenses worth $10.4 billion in a government sale of wireless airwaves for mobile data that closed last week. That came on top of $130 billion it spent in 2013 to buy from Vodafone the 45 percent in its wireless unit  that it did not already own. The wireline assets being sold to Frontier are the latest in a series of non-core assets Verizon has sold in recent months. It is also looking to sell $5 billion in wireless towers, Reuters previously reported. Verizon Chief Executive Lowell McAdam said on a January call with investors that “there are certain assets on the wireline side that we think would be better off in somebody else’s hands so we can focus our energy in a little bit more narrow geography.” The Wall Street Journal first reported that Verizon is close to selling the wireline assets to Frontier on Wednesday.

851,VZ,T-Mobile presses U.S. to change rules for sale of airwaves,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - T-Mobile’s chief executive on Wednesday called the recent U.S. auction of airwaves “a disaster” for American consumers as he took aim at rules that allowed Dish Network Corp to partner with companies that may qualify for some $13 billion in discounts. Satellite provider Dish and biggest U.S. wireless carriers Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T; Inc won most of the licenses in the record-breaking $45 billion auction of spectrum that ended last month. In a relatively common process for Federal Communications Commission auctions, Dish and partners invested in separate companies with little to no revenue that can receive a 25 percent discount in auction bidding. The FCC is now reviewing those entities’ legal and financial independence from Dish to confirm the discounts. Though Dish’s plans for the spectrum are unclear, T-Mobile CEO John Legere criticized the FCC for allowing companies that do not provide wireless services to stock up on spectrum, without specifically naming Dish. “This whole thing should scare the hell out of you and every other wireless consumer in the US,” Legere said in a blog post, “because there is another important auction coming next year, and the results have to be different if wireless competition is going survive.” The FCC is preparing for next year’s sale of highly coveted low-frequency airwaves. Legere sought to press the FCC to allocate half the spectrum for sale to smaller rivals, and not Verizon or AT&T; which already control large chunks of such low-band frequencies. Legere also said the FCC should change the rules to ensure that spectrum purchased in auction gets used “to provide service to consumers rather than allowing it to be collected and traded like financial securities.” The FCC has already planned to restrict Verizon’s and AT&T;’s participation in next year’s auction, though not to the extent sought by T-Mobile.

854,VZ,AT&T; to hook up its automated home and connected car services,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - AT&T; Inc (T.N) will link its connected car and smart home technologies to bolster its foothold in the fast-growing market for Internet-connected devices, a new battleground for the company and rivals ranging from Verizon (VZ.N) to Google Inc (GOOGL.O). The wireless company’s home security and automation service “Digital Life” and connected car service “Drive” will be integrated so users can control their homes from a dashboard in their vehicles, Glenn Lurie, chief executive of AT&T; Mobility told Reuters last week ahead of the company’s announcement at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.  “Once you’ve told your home when the car is (for instance)within 20 feet of the house to please open the garage door, put the lights on, turn the alarm off, move the thermostat up, you can have those inanimate objects, the home and your car, really taking care of you,” Lurie said. With the two services linked up, a “Drive” car can control devices in the home, including security cameras, air-conditioners, coffee makers, stereo systems, door locks, alarm sensors on windows and sensors that detect leaks from water pipes.    Most Americans own a mobile phone, and the $1.7 trillion U.S. wireless industry is turning for growth to connected devices. AT&T; said it had about 20 million connected devices from cars to cargo ship container sensors in 2014, up 21 percent from the year earlier. It has not yet revealed its revenue from its “Internet of Things” business.  Technology companies including Apple and Google are making their own plays. Mercedes-Benz has an application that lets drivers control thermostats from Nest, a company acquired by Google. Analysts expect fast growth from the “Internet of Things”, or web-connected machines and gadgets. Connected car revenue is expected to be $20 billion annually by 2018 from $3 billion in 2013, and smart homes revenue is estimated to touch $71 billion by 2018, according to Juniper Research. AT&T; has deals with eight automakers from General Motors (GM.N) to Ford (F.N)  on connected car services. Lurie said it was still signing deals. On the home front, it has partnered with home appliance makers such as Samsung and LG Electronics. Customers will pay for the new service through AT&T;’s Mobile Share Value plan. A user can add $10 to the monthly phone bill to share data across multiple connected devices such as wearables and cars, Lurie said. Or customers can opt for plans provided by their car manufacturer.  In the fourth quarter of 2014, AT&T; said it added 800,000 connected cars out of 1.3 million connected devices it added to its network.

856,VZ,Rand Paul woos donors and hackers at tech conference,"AUSTIN, Tx., March 16 (Reuters) - As his likely rivals spent the weekend shaking hands in New Hampshire, potential Republican candidate Rand Paul flew to Texas to court the software developers and entrepreneurs who are likely to play a central role in the 2016 election. The libertarian-leaning Kentucky Senator tweeted, Snapchatted and Instagrammed his way through the South by Southwest Interactive conference as he sought to make inroads among an independent-minded crowd that could serve as an important source of money, votes and programming talent for his expected presidential bid. “If you want talent you gotta go where the talent is,” he said on Monday. It was the first time a potential candidate has participated in the conference, according to organizers. Paul spent much of the weekend talking about the shared DNA of the tech community and the libertarian movement, but he spent little time talking about net neutrality, the thorny question of how to ensure that all Internet traffic is treated equally. While many tech companies back recently approved rules that broadband providers such as Verizon and Comcast should be regulated like utilities, Paul and other Republicans have argued that the new regulations will choke off innovation. It’s an argument he has made in great detail in other forums. In front of this crowd, he framed the debate in the broadest terms possible. “I don’t want the government to screw up one of the greatest technologies we’ve had,” he told the conference on Sunday, drawing applause. The applause that line drew came as a surprise for tech consultant Warren Hanes, who said he thought many at the conference weren’t aware of his opposition to the new rules. “It’s possible there are people who simply responded emotionally to the issue of less regulation,” he said. Paul’s decision to spend the weekend in Texas, rather than early-voting states like Iowa or New Hampshire, highlight the crucial role the technology industry is likely to play in 2016 - both as a source of money and talent. While former Florida Governor Jeb Bush has locked down many big donors on Wall Street and Florida Senator Marco Rubio has made inroads with the billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch, Paul has worked hard to cultivate ties in Silicon Valley, where many entrepreneurs share his frustration with government eavesdropping. Campaigns have also engaged in a technology arms race since 2004 to find ever more sophisticated ways to target voters. Planting the flag at South by Southwest could help Paul build a cutting-edge operation. On Monday, he opened an office for his political-action committee at the Capital Factory, a shared-office space for technology startups in a downtown Austin high-rise. The tech industry gave twice as much money to Democratic President Barack Obama than his Republican rival Mitt Romney in the 2012 election. Paul’s conservative stances on social issues like gay marriage and abortion could prove troubling for many in the industry, where liberal social views are widespread. Mozilla Corp. CEO Brendan Eich, for example, resigned under pressure in 2014 after board members objected to his support for a previous campaign against gay marriage. Paul’s views on social issues are “a real problem for people like me,” said Jeff Boedeker, a producer at a multimedia company. Still, he says he believes the final say on abortion and same sex marriage will go to the courts, not the president, making support of Paul more palatable.

861,VZ,Verizon's online video service revenue may depend on ads: CFO,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc may rely largely on advertising for revenue from its upcoming online video service, Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said in an interview. This could set the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier apart from rival online video services such as Dish Network Corp’s Sling TV and Sony Corp’s PlayStation Vue, which offer traditional TV content with ads and collect subscription fees.  Original online programing on Verizon’s service could use an “advertising-type” model, “not necessarily a consumer-pay model,” Shammo said in the recent interview. Most Americans own a mobile phone, and Verizon is looking at online video delivery to increase data consumption on mobile devices and increase revenue.  The digital video service, which it expects to release in mid-2015, is aimed at families and younger viewers who increasingly consume content on mobile devices. Earlier this month, Verizon announced a deal to add original online programing to its service from DreamWorks Animation and its AwesomenessTV unit that is known for creating popular content aimed at teens and younger adults known as millennials on Google Inc’s YouTube.  More content deals are in the works, Shammo said. Dish’s Sling TV is a $20-a-month online video streaming service. Sony’s new PlayStation Vue Web offers more than 85 channels, starting at $50. Apple Inc is in talks with programmers to offer a slimmed-down bundle of about 25 channels, the Wall Street Journal reported this month.  Verizon executives have said the company’s “mobile-first” service will offer 20 to 30 channels and that they also see a market for streaming original content.  As the company crafts a revenue model for its new service, it is also contemplating “pay-per-view” options for live streamed coverage of concerts and sporting events as technology evolves, Shammo said. Verizon has said it plans to use a technology called multicasting, which can be used to stream live video to multiple mobile devices through a single lane of airwaves. But mobile device makers have only recently begun installing chipsets that support this, executives have said. The service was developed by integrating Verizon’s “OnCue” video streaming technology that the company purchased from Intel Corp in 2014 and its Digital Media Services technology, which formats content and splices in ads.   ",3262015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-verizon-video/verizons-online-video-service-revenue-may-depend-on-ads-cfo-idUSKBN0MM1YX20150326
862,VZ,"Chinese hackers target Southeast Asia, India, researchers say","(Reuters) - Hackers, most likely from China, have been spying on governments and businesses in Southeast Asia and India uninterrupted for a decade, researchers at internet security company FireEye Inc  said. In a report released on Monday, FireEye said the cyber espionage operations dated back to at least 2005 and “focused on targets - government and commercial - who hold key political, economic and military information about the region.” “Such a sustained, planned development effort coupled with the (hacking) group’s regional targets and mission, lead us to believe that this activity is state-sponsored - most likely the Chinese government,” the report’s authors said. Bryce Boland, Chief Technology Officer for Asia Pacific at FireEye and co-author of the report, said the attack was still ongoing, noting that the servers the attackers used were still operational, and that FireEye continued to see attacks against its customers, who number among the targets. Reuters couldn’t independently confirm any of the assertions made in the report. China has always denied accusations that it uses the Internet to spy on governments, organizations and companies.  Asked about the FireEye report on Monday, foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said: “I want to stress that the Chinese government resolutely bans and cracks down on any hacking acts. This position is clear and consistent. Hacking attacks are a joint problem faced by the international community and need to be dealt with cooperatively rather than via mutual censure.” The Cyberspace Administration of China, the Internet regulator, didn’t immediately respond to written requests for comment. China has been accused before of targeting countries in South and Southeast Asia. In 2011, researchers from McAfee reported a campaign dubbed Shady Rat which attacked Asian governments and institutions, among other targets.  Efforts by the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to build cyber defenses have been sporadic. While ASEAN has long acknowledged its importance, “very little has come of this discourse,” said Miguel Gomez, a researcher at De La Salle University in the Philippines.  The problem is not new: Singapore has reported sophisticated cyber-espionage attacks on civil servants in several ministries dating back to 2004. The campaign described by FireEye differs from other such operations mostly in its scale and longevity, Boland said. He said the group appeared to include at least two software developers. The report did not offer other indications of the possible size of the group or where it’s based. The group remained undetected for so long it was able to re-use methods and malware dating back to 2005, and developed its own system to manage and prioritize attacks, even organizing shifts to cope with the workload and different languages of its targets, Boland told Reuters. The attackers focused not only on governments, but on ASEAN itself, as well as corporations and journalists interested in China. Other targets included Indian or Southeast Asian-based companies in sectors such as construction, energy, transport, telecommunications and aviation, FireEye says.  Mostly they sought to gain access by sending so-called phishing emails to targets purported to come from colleagues or trusted sources, and containing documents relevant to their interests. Boland said it wasn’t possible to gauge the damage done as it had taken place over such a long period, but he said the impact could be “massive”. “Without being able to detect it, there’s no way these agencies can work out what the impacts are. They don’t know what has been stolen.” Pornchai Rujiprapa, Minister of Information and Communication Technology for ASEAN member Thailand, said the government was proposing a new law to combat cyber attacks as existing legislation was outdated.  “So far we haven’t found any attack so big it threatens national security, but we are concerned if there is any in the future. That’s why we need a new law to handle it,” he told Reuters.

863,VZ,"RPT-User mistakes aid most cyber attacks, Verizon and Symantec studies show","(Repeats story with no change to text) By Joseph Menn April 14 (Reuters) - When a cyber security breach hits the news, those most closely involved often have incentive to play up the sophistication of the attack. If hackers are portrayed as well-funded geniuses, victims look less vulnerable, security firms can flog their products and services, and government officials can push for tougher regulation or seek more money for cyber defenses. But two deeply researched reports being released this week underscore the less-heralded truth: the vast majority of hacking attacks are successful because employees click on links in tainted emails, companies fail to apply available patches to known software flaws, or technicians do not configure systems properly. These conclusions will be in the minds of executives attending the world’s largest technology security conference next week in San Francisco, a conference named after lead sponsor RSA, the security division of EMC Corp. In the best-known annual study of data breaches, a report from Verizon Communications Inc to be released on Wednesday found that more than two-thirds of the 290 electronic espionage cases it learned about in 2014 involved phishing, the security industry’s term for trick emails. Because so many people click on tainted links or attachments, sending phishing emails to just 10 employees will get hackers inside corporate gates 90 percent of the time, Verizon found. “There’s an overarching pattern,” said Verizon scientist Bob Rudis. Attackers use phishing to install malware and steal credentials from employees, then they use those credentials to roam through networks and access programs and files, he said. Verizon’s report includes its own business investigations and data from 70 other contributors, including law enforcement. It found that while major new vulnerabilities such as Heartbleed  are being used by hackers within hours of their announcement, more attacks last year exploited patchable vulnerabilities dating from 2007, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. Another annual cyber report, to be released on Tuesday by Symantec Corp, found that state-sponsored spies also used phishing techniques because they work and because the less-sophisticated approach drew less scrutiny from defenders. Once inside a system, however, the spies turned fancy, writing customized software to evade detection by whatever security programs the target has installed, Symantec said. “Once I’m in, I can do what I need to,” said Robert Shaker, an incident response manager at Symantec. The report drew on data from 57 million sensors in 157 countries and territories. Another troubling trend Symantec found involves the use of “ransomware,” in which hackers encrypt a computer’s files and promise to release them only if the user pays a ransom. (Some 80 percent of the time, they do not decrypt the files even then.) The new twist comes from hackers who encrypt files, including those inside critical infrastructure facilities, but do not ask for anything. The mystery is why: Shaker said it is not clear whether the attackers are securing the information for resale to other spies or potential saboteurs, or whether they plan on making their own demands in the future. At next week’s RSA Conference, protecting critical infrastructure systems under increasing attack will be a major theme. Another theme will be the need for more sharing of “intelligence” about emerging threats - between the public and private sectors, within the security industry, and within certain industries. While many of the biggest breaches of the past two years involved retailers, the healthcare industry has figured heavily in recent months.

868,VZ,"User mistakes aid most cyber attacks, Verizon and Symantec studies show","(Reuters) - When a cyber security breach hits the news, those most closely involved often have incentive to play up the sophistication of the attack. If hackers are portrayed as well-funded geniuses, victims look less vulnerable, security firms can flog their products and services, and government officials can push for tougher regulation or seek more money for cyber defenses. But two deeply researched reports being released this week underscore the less-heralded truth: the vast majority of hacking attacks are successful because employees click on links in tainted emails, companies fail to apply available patches to known software flaws, or technicians do not configure systems properly. These conclusions will be in the minds of executives attending the world’s largest technology security conference next week in San Francisco, a conference named after lead sponsor RSA, the security division of EMC Corp. In the best-known annual study of data breaches, a report from Verizon Communications Inc to be released on Wednesday found that more than two-thirds of the 290 electronic espionage cases it learned about in 2014 involved phishing, the security industry’s term for trick emails. Because so many people click on tainted links or attachments, sending phishing emails to just 10 employees will get hackers inside corporate gates 90 percent of the time, Verizon found.  “There’s an overarching pattern,” said Verizon scientist Bob Rudis. Attackers use phishing to install malware and steal credentials from employees, then they use those credentials to roam through networks and access programs and files, he said. Verizon’s report includes its own business investigations and data from 70 other contributors, including law enforcement. It found that while major new vulnerabilities such as Heartbleed  are being used by hackers within hours of their announcement, more attacks last year exploited patchable vulnerabilities dating from 2007, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013.  Another annual cyber report, to be released on Tuesday by Symantec Corp, found that state-sponsored spies also used phishing techniques because they work and because the less-sophisticated approach drew less scrutiny from defenders. Once inside a system, however, the spies turned fancy, writing customized software to evade detection by whatever security programs the target has installed, Symantec said. “Once I’m in, I can do what I need to,” said Robert Shaker, an incident response manager at Symantec. The report drew on data from 57 million sensors in 157 countries and territories. Another troubling trend Symantec found involves the use of “ransomware,” in which hackers encrypt a computer’s files and promise to release them only if the user pays a ransom. (Some 80 percent of the time, they do not decrypt the files even then.) The new twist comes from hackers who encrypt files, including those inside critical infrastructure facilities, but do not ask for anything. The mystery is why: Shaker said it is not clear whether the attackers are securing the information for resale to other spies or potential saboteurs, or whether they plan on making their own demands in the future. At next week’s RSA Conference, protecting critical infrastructure systems under increasing attack will be a major theme.  Another theme will be the need for more sharing of “intelligence” about emerging threats - between the public and private sectors, within the security industry, and within certain industries. While many of the biggest breaches of the past two years involved retailers, the healthcare industry has figured heavily in recent months. Former FBI futurist Marc Goodman said that both spies and organized criminals are likely at work, the former seeking leverage to use in recruiting informants and the latter looking to cash in on medical and insurance fraud.

872,VZ,"UPDATE 1-What to Watch in the Week Ahead and on Monday, April 20","(Adds events for Verizon, AT&T;, Canadian National Railway and Rogers Communications) Week Ahead A slew of Dow 30 companies report results in the week: Chemicals conglomerate DuPont, industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corp, property and casualty insurer Travelers Companies Inc and wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc on Tuesday; McDonald’s Corp, AT&T; Inc, Boeing Co and Coca-Cola Co on Wednesday; and diversified manufacturer 3M Co, Procter & Gamble and Microsoft Corp on Thursday. While DuPont is expected to report lower first-quarter results, Travelers Companies Inc’s first-quarter results are expected to be in line with estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Investors will keep an eye out for details on Verizon’s upcoming mobile video service and capital expenditure range and will look for updates on AT&T;’s proposed $48.5 billion deal to buy DirectTV, which is under regulatory review. Boeing faces fears of an aircraft downturn after it booked record orders in 2014, while Steve Easterbrook, McDonald’s new CEO, is charged with reviving the company’s falling sales and managing negative PR around the healthiness of its food. Investors will be watching the impact of the strong dollar on 3M’s first-quarter results and Microsoft is expected to report sharply lower profit for its third quarter as sales of personal computers remain soggy. Search engine giant Google Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts’ estimate on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Google, which has been officially charged of cheating consumers and competitors by the European Union, is also being investigated for its Android mobile operating system. Analysts say the latter could prove a bigger threat to Google’s future profitability. Analysts expect foreign exchange to negatively impact revenues in the first quarter even as paid click growth is poised to decelerate again. Facebook Inc is expected to post a first-quarter profit above Wall Street’s expectations on Wednesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The world’s largest social network’s business has been booming thanks to its mobile ads on smartphones and tablets. Many investors also expect that video ads will provide the company’s next leg of growth. Facebook has also been stepping up efforts to expand products like messaging service WhatsApp and photo-sharing service Instagram. Investors will be looking out for the company’s outlook for the remainder of 2015. On Thursday, the e-commerce company Amazon.com Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue largely in line with analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. However, analysts are expecting margins to improve as the company gets a grip on a slew of investments on everything from Hollywood-style television productions to cloud computing and consumer devices. On Tuesday, Yahoo Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts’ estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, as its overall share of U.S. desktop searches declines. Analysts and investors will be looking out for any details on the tax-free sale of its Alibaba shares. General Motors Co reports first-quarter results before the market opens on Thursday. Analysts are expecting 96 cents per share, up sharply from a year before. On Wednesday, chipmaker Qualcomm Inc is likely to report second-quarter revenue and profit broadly in line with analysts’ average estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Qualcomm lowered its outlook for fiscal 2015 in January, saying it did not expect its newest Snapdragon mobile chip to be used in a major customer’s flagship smartphone. Samsung opted for its own mobile processor and modem chip in the Galaxy S6 instead of equivalents from Qualcomm. The chipmaker had also warned that “challenges” with another of its chips had hurt its competitiveness in China. Qualcomm recently came under pressure from hedge fund Jana Partners to spin off its chip business from its patent-licensing business. Credit Suisse reports earnings for the first three months of 2015 on Tuesday. Meanwhile, on Friday the Swiss bank will ask shareholders to sign off in a symbolic vote on executive pay for 2014, when Credit Suisse became the largest bank in decades to plead guilty to a U.S. criminal charge and will pay more than $2.5 billion in penalties for helping Americans evade taxes. Investors will focus on existing home sales on Wednesday, which is expected to have increased 3.0 percent to an annual rate of 5.05 million units. Also, data for new home sales is expected to be released on Thursday. On Friday, the U.S. Commerce Department releases data for durable goods. Starbucks Corp reports its second-quarter results on Thursday. Starbucks is one of the restaurant industry’s top performers, but investors and analysts worry that its streak of red-hot growth is coming to an end. The company has a variety of plans in place to boost sales (adding booze, smoothies, more lunch and dinner options, improving and expanding tea selections and testing delivery) and investors will be looking for proof that those are working. On Tuesday, Yum Brands Inc will report its first-quarter results. Yum’s China business remains in the spotlight as it fights to recover from the latest food scandal in its biggest market. Analysts say the company is suffering from “brand fatigue” in China, where competition is mounting and its image has been hurt by food scares that have raised doubts over its supply chain. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc is slated to announce results for the first quarter on Tuesday. Chipotle is still having problems finding pork suppliers to replace the one it suspended for running afoul of its animal welfare rules. The company says customers have simply switched to other meats and that it isn’t losing sales - but investors will be on alert for any signs of a slowdown. Drugmaker Biogen Inc is expected to report a higher first-quarter profit on Friday, driven by strong sales of its top-selling oral MS drug, Tecfidera, which has seen burgeoning sales since its launch in 2013. Biogen, which leads the United States multiple sclerosis market with five drugs for the condition, recently reported promising data for its Alzheimer’s drug. Investors will also be looking for commentary on Tecfider’s growth expectations, and potential for competition, as well as the longer-acting MS injectable Plegridy. AbbVie Inc, whose planned $21 billion acquisition of Pharmacyclics Inc is meant to lessen the company’s dependence on its blockbuster Humira arthritis drug, is expected to report sharply higher earnings and sales for the first quarter on Thursday, fueled by Humira’s continuing growth and sales of the company’s recently approved Viekira Pak treatment for hepatitis C. Investors will be keen for details on sales prospects for Viekira Pak, given steep price discounts AbbVie has given to compete with Gilead Science Inc’s potent treatments for the liver disease. Eli Lilly and Co is expected to report higher first-quarter earnings on Thursday as the Indianapolis drugmaker begins to recover from patent expirations that slashed demand for its biggest products. The company is well positioned to deliver a promised return to profit growth this year, helped by new treatments for cancer and diabetes and growing sales of its animal health brands. Abbott Laboratories will report its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Recovering sales of Abbott Laboratories’ infant formulas, following costly recalls in Asia, and improving performance of the company’s branded generic medicines, are expected to drive quarterly earnings growth despite the negative impact of the stronger dollar. Ebay Inc is expected to report results for the first quarter largely in line with Wall Street expectations on Wednesday. The company has seen strong growth in payments business as well as its non-auction e-commerce business. Analysts expect that the company will continue to benefit from the rise in demand for mobile devices, as consumers increasingly use their smart phones and tablets to shop online. Investors will look for details on the company’s plans for the spinoff of PayPal scheduled for the second half of 2015. On Thursday, Dow Chemical Co is expected to report a lower first-quarter profit due to a stronger dollar and a slowdown in its agricultural business. The company last month said it would offload a bulk of its low-margin bleach and vinyl-related business to Olin in a $5 billion. Investors will be looking for further comments on the company’s cost-saving plans. Johnson Controls Inc, the auto parts supplier and maker of climate control systems for buildings, is expected to report higher second-quarter profit on Thursday, driven by higher sales in its seating and interiors business as auto sales and production rose in the first quarter. The company’s buildings efficiency business, which provides air conditioning equipment and building management services, is also expected to report higher revenue as U.S. office vacancy rate declined to its lowest level since the third quarter to 2009. Investors will be looking for comments on Johnson Controls’ business focus and outlook following the sale of its workplace solutions business to CBRE Group. Pentagon’s No. 1 arms supplier, Lockheed Martin Corp, reports first-quarter results on Tuesday. Lockheed Martin has been focusing on increasing sales to commercial customers in United States as well as international governments to make up for pressures from tight U.S. defense spending. Lockheed gets 17 percent of its revenue from international markets and 1 percent from U.S. commercial customers. Investors will be looking to see if Lockheed still expects U.S. military spending to meaningfully pick up this year. Weapons maker Raytheon Co has increased exposure to international markets, which account for about 27 percent of its total sales, as U.S. defense spending remains tight. The maker of the Tomahawk missile and the Patriot missile defense system forecast disappointing 2015 revenue in January as domestic orders remained weak. When the company will report its first-quarter results on Thursday, investors will be looking for an update on a $2 billion order for the Patriot missile defense system that Raytheon expected to win in the first quarter. On Tuesday, Omnicom Group Inc, the No. 1 U.S. advertising company, is expected to report first-quarter results largely in-line with analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Omnicom had warned that a strong dollar would hit revenue this year. Omnicom, whose clients include Apple, McDonald’s and Adidas, gets a little less than half of its revenue from outside the United States. On Friday, Interpublic Group of Companies Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts’ average estimate according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company’s previous quarter was helped by higher ad spending by businesses in the United States. On Tuesday, chipmaker Broadcom Corp is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts’ estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Analysts expect the company’s connectivity business to sequentially decline as it comes off a strong Apple-driven fourth quarter. Analysts will be looking for the company to provide outlook for the quarter ending June. On Wednesday, data storage company EMC Corp is expected to report first-quarter profit and revenue below analysts’ estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company had in January forecast a lower-than-expected profit for 2015 and said it would cut jobs. The company, which earns nearly half of its revenue from international markets, is expected to be hurt by a strong dollar. Analysts say enterprise storage demand has been mixed in quarter which may hurt EMC. Virtualization software maker VMware Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts’ estimate on Tuesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, hurt by a stronger dollar. More than 48 percent of VMware’s revenue comes from outside the United States. Analysts at Wells Fargo estimate a negative impact of 3-4 percent from foreign currency on license revenue growth. Programmable chip maker Xilinx Inc will report fourth-quarter results after markets close on Wednesday. The company, which dominates the programmable chip market along with Altera Corp, is expected to report profit and revenue that are largely in line with analyst expectations, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Investors will look for updates on sales to the broadcast, consumer and automotive end market and sales to communications and data center customers. PulteGroup Inc’s first-quarter results are expected to be released on Thursday. Coming on the heels of larger peer D.R. Horton’s second-quarter results on Wednesday, PulteGroup’s results are expected to provide further evidence of a strong spring selling season this year, suggesting that a slowdown in housing starts in the first three months did not point to underlying weakness in the U.S. housing market. Steelmaker Nucor Corp will report first-quarter results on Thursday. Nucor has been struggling with lower selling prices due to high levels of imports. Declining oil prices have also led to excess inventory in Nucor’s pipe and tube business. Analysts will be looking for comments on inventory, steel demand and overcapacity in its steel mills business. On Thursday, Patterson-UTI Energy Inc, the second-largest land driller in North America, is expected to report a lower first-quarter profit as weak oil prices weigh on drilling activity. Patterson, which halved its rig construction program for this year, had warned that 2015 would be “challenging,” having received indications that customers could terminate a number of longer-term contracts early. Investors will be looking for updates on further cost saving measures and commentary on contracts and dayrates for its 16 new high-tech Apex rigs, which analysts believe could help the driller boost cash margins this year. Contract driller Nabors Industries Ltd, which is merging with C&J; Energy, is expected to report on Tuesday a lower profit in the first quarter as drilling activity continues to be hurt by the fall in oil prices. The company has already warned of weak activity and pricing pressure in its international operations. Investors will be looking for updates on any job cuts and the company’s plans to idle rigs in an oversupplied market. On Tuesday, coal miner Arch Coal Inc is expected to report a ninth straight quarterly loss and on Thursday, coal miner Peabody Energy Corp is expected to report a wider first-quarter loss due to continued weakness in coal prices. Kimberly-Clark Corp, the maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers, is expected to report better-than-expected first-quarter sales, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, helped by growing demand in emerging markets such as Brazil, China and South Africa. However, higher input costs and a stronger dollar could have hurt profit. The company said in February it would transfer pension obligations to two insurers to reduce risk and will take a charge in the second quarter. It had also warned of an 8-9 percent drop in 2015 sales hurt by the dollar and weak demand for core products such as Huggies diapers. Investors will be looking for any updates on forecast on Tuesday. Hershey Co, the maker of Hershey’s Kisses and Reese’s peanut butter cups, has been struggling with high cocoa and dairy costs and intense competition from rivals such as Mondelez and Mars. To tackle growing competition, the company has been pouring money in advertisements and promotions, but this is expected to hurt its full-year earnings per share by 2 percentage points. It has also tried to diversify and add a new stream of revenue by acquiring jerky maker Krave Pure Foods Inc in January, marking its first foray into meat snacks. When the company will report its first-quarter profit on Thursday, investors will be looking out for comments on whether the company will make more acquisitions in the meat and bakery snacks category, which are becoming more popular than candy, and the effect of the strong dollar on its outlook. Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc will report its first-quarter results on Thursday. Investors will be looking at how much Boston’s record snowfall hurt results at Dunkin Brands, whose Dunkin’ Donuts shops are concentrated in the U.S. northeast. Experts say the impact could be meaningful. Under Armour Inc, a sports apparel and footwear maker, is expected to report profit and sales for the first quarter in line with analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Analysts expect Under Armour to continue its 19-quarter streak of reporting more than 20 percent growth in revenue, helped by expanded offerings in sport and outdoor clothing, strong demand for its Speedform Apollo running shoes, new launches in basketball footwear and sponsorship deals. The company is also expected to benefit from investments in its fast-growing digital platform and from the acquisitions of fitness tracking apps Endomondo and MyFitnessPal. When the company will report on Tuesday, investors will look for an update to the full-year forecast and color on the performance of new launches in footwear. Hanesbrands Inc, the innerwear and apparel maker is expected to report first-quarter profit and sales above analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Analysts are projecting first-quarter sales growth of more than 15 percent as the company benefits from higher sales of sport and gym clothing at department stores, and the acquisition of DBApparel and Maidenform Brands. When the company reports on Thursday, investors will look for an update to the full-year forecast and more color on the company’s recent acquisition of college logo clothing maker Knights Apparel. Ingersoll-Rand Plc, the maker of Trane air conditioners and Thermo King refrigeration units, is expected to report a higher first-quarter profit on Thursday, driven by growth in global industrial and construction markets. Investors will be looking for the impact of a strong dollar on the company’s industrial business, which has a higher proportion of revenue coming from outside the United States. Investors will also be looking for an update on how much the weakness in oil prices has hurt the company’s newly acquired centrifugal compression business. Xerox Corp, which has been shifting its focus to IT services from making printers and copiers, is expected to report first-quarter revenue that is slightly below analysts’ estimate on Friday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Xerox had cut its profit forecast for 2015 for the second time after reporting its sixth-consecutive drop in revenue last quarter. In December, the company agreed to sell its IT outsourcing arm to Atos. Teck Resources Ltd, Canada’s largest diversified miner, is expected to report on Tuesday a lower profit in the first quarter as prices for both copper and steel-making coal remain depressed amid a fall in demand. The company in March denied media reports that it was in talks to merge with Chilean copper producer Antofagasta. Teck CEO also refuted speculations of a possible merger with HudBay Minerals or an acquisition of Zaldivar, a copper mine owned by Barrick Gold. Teck said in February it might reduce its dividend in July if the industry-wide production cuts fail to boost coal prices. Investors will be interested in any comments of a possible merger or acquisition and demand for steel-making coal. Car seat maker Lear Corp is expected to report higher first-quarter profit on Friday helped by strong demand in North America and a rise in vehicle production. Some analysts expect Lear to benefit from cheaper commodity prices and report higher margins. Investors will look for Lear’s comments on Mercato Capital seeking a split of the auto parts suppliers businesses. Investment bank and asset manager Lazard Ltd reports first-quarter earnings on Thursday. Lazard is expected to benefit from a jump in corporate dealmaking, which should have boosted its M&A; advisory business. Globally, deals worth $811.8 billion were announced in the first quarter, up 21 percent, compared to a year earlier. Among them, Lazard advised on the merger of Heinz-Kraft and the sale of Serbia’s state-operated Telekom Srbija. However, analysts expect lower-than-anticipated deal completions to weigh on the company’s quarterly revenue. Lazard has been focusing more on asset management to be less reliant on financial advisory fees. AutoNation Inc, the largest U.S. car dealer chain, reports first-quarter results on Wednesday. Investors will be watching margins on new car sales, any potential expansion moves and for any concerns about U.S. consumer spending going forward. On Thursday, Qlik Technologies Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue above analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, on higher demand for its data analytics software. The company had forecast full-year adjusted profit below analysts’ average estimate and its revenue forecast was also largely below Wall Street estimates. Touchscreen chipmaker Synaptics Inc is expected to report third-quarter profit below analysts’ estimate on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, on weak demand from smartphone makers. Analysts have said that certain Samsung designs that have come out recently are not using Synaptics touch IC products. Online music streaming service provider Pandora Media Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue above analysts’ average estimate on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company is expected to benefit from stronger listening hours and its gradual move into automobiles, where more than half of all radio listening occurs in the U.S. Investors will look for updates on user and local ad growth. On Wednesday, specialty mattress maker Select Comfort Corp is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts’ average estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, halting a run of four straight quarters where sales beat expectations. Investors will be looking out for the company’s Sleep Number mattress sales as well as for any changes in full-year outlook. The company provided 2015 profit forecast below estimates in February. On Friday, Apigee Corp, which develops software to manage web applications, is expected to raise up to $92 million in its IPO, valuing the company at about $523.8 million at the higher end of its IPO price range. The company’s software platform allows businesses to design and deploy application programming interfaces (API) to link its core IT systems with data used by customers, others. The company primarily offers application interface management and predictive analysis services. On Tuesday, Canadian Finance Minister Joe Oliver will present the annual federal budget for the fiscal year that began on April 1, the last budget before the general election scheduled for October. He has promised a balanced budget and has pledged to introduce balanced budget legislation as well. The Conservative government has already introduced a package of tax cuts and family benefits, and infrastructure spending, that has soaked up much of the anticipated surplus. A decline in oil prices has cut much of the remaining room for maneuver. Prime Minister Stephen Harper has ruled out major stimulus spending, arguing that despite cheap oil the economy was still growing. On Thursday Mexico’s national statistics office will release economic activity data for February, after the gauge expanded in January on a pickup in services and agriculture while industry sank. Also on Thursday, Mexico will release annual inflation data for the first half of April, after the indicator picked up to 3.14 in March, reaching just above the central bank’s 3 percent target. Retail sales data released on Friday will reveal how the gauge fared in February, after it rose at its fastest pace in over a year in January. Monday, April 20 International Business Machines Corp is expected to report lower revenue for the 12th straight quarter, as it exits unprofitable businesses and attempts to move into cloud-focused areas, away from its traditional hardware and consulting services foundation. Net profit for the first quarter is expected to rise slightly. Morgan Stanley is expected to report a rise in first-quarter earnings. The company’s institutional securities business now depends more on equities trading business, rather than fixed income trading. Rival Goldman Sachs’s strong performance in stock trading in the first quarter puts the spotlight on Morgan Stanley. The bank has also been focusing more on its wealth management business. It is trying to squeeze more revenue out of its major businesses by getting wealth clients to use investment banking and trading services. Ruth Porat, Morgan Stanley’s chief financial officer, who helped execute a sweeping cost-cutting strategy across several business lines at the bank, will step down to join Google as its finance chief next month. Halliburton Co is expected to report a lower first-quarter profit, hurt by soft drilling activity. Oil producers have significantly scaled back spending amid weak oil prices. However, cost cuts and continued strength in the Middle East and Asia are expected to help the oilfield services provider minimize the effects of the oil downturn. The company has said it would cut more than 6,000 jobs and investors will seek details about any further cost cuts, especially after Schlumberger cut 11,000 more jobs. Halliburton is looking to complete its $35 billion-acquisition of smaller rival Baker Hughes, which is expected to report its own first-quarter results on Tuesday. Investors will want to know about more potential asset sales after Halliburton said earlier it would sell three businesses to pave the way for regulatory clearance for the deal. Investors will also look to see if the deal will help it better cope with pricing pressure from oil producers. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd, the world’s second-largest cruise operator by revenue, is expected to report first-quarter profit and sales below analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company had forecast revenue below expectations, citing a strong dollar and weak pricing in the Caribbean. Investors will be looking out for any changes in full-year forecast and comments on the Caribbean market, as well as updates on expansion in Europe and Asia. Toymaker Hasbro Inc will report first-quarter results before the bell. The sequels of “Jurassic Park” and “The Avengers” in first half of 2015 and the new “Star Wars” movie in December are expected to boost Hasbro’s sales this year and keep it growing at a faster pace than larger rival Mattel Inc’s. Canadian National Railway reports its financial results for the first quarter. On average, analysts are expecting earnings to rise to 85 Canadian cents a share from 66 Canadian cents a year earlier, as revenue increases to C$3.04 billion. The company may discuss its safety record and the costs associated with its recent string of derailments as cleanup continues near the town of Gogama, in northern Ontario.  Rogers Communications Inc, Canada’s largest wireless phone provider and a major cable and media company, reports results for the first quarter. The company has lost ground in wireless and other subscriber metrics in recent quarters but has been able on average to charge its customers more, a trend investors will be eager to appraise.

874,VZ,Verizon to offer custom pay TV with monthly programming bundles,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc is rolling out a new pay TV plan that allows consumers to choose every month bundles of channels they want to see, hoping the flexibility will lure customers away from cable rivals and upstart Web TV companies. The move is a small step in the direction of ‘a la carte’ programming, which means allowing customers to build their own pay TV service, channel by channel. U.S. television networks have long resisted ‘a la carte,’ in part because of concerns that subscribers will drop less popular channels. Verizon said its new “Custom TV” packages start at $65 a month for broadband service, 36 fixed basic channels and two genre-based channel packs, such as a sports bundle or kids channels. Users can add extra packs for $10 each, or swap or unsubscribe any pack after 30 days. Verizon has seven channel packs in total. Verizon is targeting consumers looking for something in between fully loaded cable and satellite TV packages, and “skinny” or smaller, cheaper bundles offered Comcast Corp or Dish Network Corp’s online Sling TV. “Everybody is getting into the video space... increasingly customers are saying, ‘I want to pay for what I view,’” Tami Erwin, the president of Verizon’s national operations told Reuters. Verizon’s FiOS is the sixth-largest U.S. pay TV provider by video subscribers, according to research form IDC. The rise of online video services such as Netflix Inc has put pressure on pay TV providers to innovate. Analysts said Custom TV could help Verizon better compete against cable rivals.  “It’s not a pure ‘a la carte’ the way some consumers want, but we are certainly through the Verizon offering going to have more choice and the type of choice that has not been associated with traditional pay TV services,” Greg Ireland, a director at market research firm IDC said. Dish’s Sling TV offers a fixed set of basic channels at $20 a month, and genre-specific bundles can be added for $5. The service runs on an Internet connection that a user needs to pay for separately.     Chris Young, an analyst at research firm SNL Kagan, said Verizon is trying to give customers more customization and the greater amount of flexibility “could prevent some customers from cutting the cord.” ",4172015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-verizon-fios/verizon-to-offer-custom-pay-tv-with-monthly-programming-bundles-idUSKBN0N802D20150417

876,VZ,Verizon profit beats estimates as more users sign up,"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc’s quarterly profit beat analysts’ expectations, helped by higher net addition of postpaid subscribers as users added more devices to data plans. Shares of Verizon rose 0.6 percent to $49.65 in premarket trading. The largest U.S wireless company added a net 565,000 retail postpaid subscribers in the first quarter ended March 31. Customer defections, known as churn, in postpaid accounts fell to 1.03 percent from 1.07 percent a year earlier. Total revenue in the company’s wireless business rose 6.9 percent to $22.33 billion. Revenue in its FiOS Internet and video product business rose 10.2 percent to $3.35 billion. Verizon’s retail postpaid average revenue per account fell to $156.14 from $159.67.

Nearly 75 percent of the S&P; 500 components that have reported earnings so far have beat analyst expectations, topping the 70 percent average in the last four quarters. However, just 45.8 percent have beat on revenue, compared with the 58 percent average top line beat over the last year. Dow components Verizon, DuPont and United Technologies beat expectations even as the strong dollar weighed on the results of DuPont and UTX. Verizon shares were up 0.2 percent at $49.47, DuPont rose 0.33 percent to $73.08 and United Technologies added 1.62 percent to $118.40. The dollar is up almost 9 percent since the beginning of the year against a basket of major currencies. A strong dollar hurts companies with large overseas operations. “Market is in momentum mode and is taking the path of least resistance. It’s still early in the week and things could change with some major tech stock reporting later in the week but there has been the absence of a real negative factor,” said Brian Fenske, head of sales trading at ITG in New York. IBM shares were down 0.37 percent at $165.55 in premarket trading after its earnings exceeded low expectations on Monday as it shed unprofitable businesses to focus on cloud-computing. Mylan was up 8.8 percent at $74 after Israeli drugmaker Teva made an unsolicited offer for the company for $82 per share, in what could be the drug industry’s largest takeover attempt this year. Teva was up 2.6 percent at $64.92. Earnings expected later on Tuesday include Chipotle, Yahoo and Yum Brands.

879,VZ,UPDATE 1-ESPN says Verizon made unilateral decision on custom TV offerings,"(Adds Verizon comments) By Lisa Richwine and Malathi Nayak April 22 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc acted on its own when the company decided how to offer ESPN and other Walt Disney Co channels in smaller custom TV packages, a spokeswoman for ESPN said on Wednesday. Disney, Comcast Corp’s NBCUniversal and 21st Century Fox have said Verizon’s slimmer TV bundles violate existing agreements. The new offerings let customers sign up for a slimmed-down, cheaper bundle of 36 fixed channels through Verizon’s FiOS TV and add on genre-specific packages such as kids, sports or news. “The issue here is that Verizon made unilateral decisions on how to offer ABC Family, Disney Channels, ESPN and ESPN2 that are in violation of our existing agreements,” the spokeswoman said. Disney has teamed with other distributors on new TV packages. It made a landmark deal last year to include its programming on Dish Network Corp’s Sling TV, a smaller channel bundle delivered over the Internet. “The Walt Disney Company is at the forefront of working with distributors to create new and innovative consumer offerings,” the ESPN spokeswoman said. Verizon has said it believes the company is within its legal rights to offer the new custom packages and will keep selling them. “Nobody likes change and everybody resists change,” Verizon Chief Financial Officer Frank Shammo said in an interview on Tuesday. “It’s changing the model that’s been existing for twenty-some years. But this is all about the consumer.” On Sunday, Verizon unveiled its new pay TV plan that allows consumers to choose every month bundles of channels they want to see, hoping the flexibility will lure customers away from cable rivals and upstart online TV companies. The new service does not offer “a la carte” programming, or allow customers to build their own pay TV service, channel by channel. But is a step closer to that type of service. U.S. television networks have resisted ‘a la carte’ in favor of packaging less popular channels with the ones that are most watched.

881,VZ,"Verizon says Disney, Fox pull ads promoting Custom TV in N.Y.","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc said on Thursday that Walt Disney Co and Twenty-First Century Fox are not running ads promoting the wireless carrier’s recently launched FiOS Custom TV service on its channels in the New York market. Since Verizon unveiled its cheaper, slimmer pay-TV plan on Sunday, Disney, Comcast Corp’s NBCUniversal and 21st Century Fox have pushed back and said Verizon’s FiOS TV was violating existing agreements.  A Verizon spokeswoman said Disney was refusing to run the Custom TV ads on channels such as ABC and ESPN in New York. Fox did the same in New York, specifically on its stations WNYW and YES Network, she added.  An ESPN spokeswoman on Thursday said, “The issue here is that Verizon unilaterally decided” how to offer Disney-owned channels ABC Family, the Disney Channels, ESPN 1 and ESPN 2 on the Custom TV service.  When Verizon kicked off its marketing campaign on Tuesday, the Verizon spokeswoman said, an ESPN radio spot did not go on air and a video ad that was expected to run was not shown on ABC’s local New York affiliate channel.  However, Disney did run Custom TV ads in Washington, D.C., Boston and Pittsburgh, she added.   Verizon’s new pay-TV plan lets customers sign up for a slimmed-down, cheaper bundle of 36 fixed channels through its FiOS TV and then add on genre-specific packages such as kids, sports or news. It hopes the flexibility will lure them away from cable rivals and upstart online TV companies. “Disney’s anti-competitive tactic is only hurting the consumer,” Verizon’s spokeswoman said. “From our perspective there is no dispute.”  Verizon executives have maintained that their product does not invalidate agreements with content partners.

It made a landmark deal last year to include its programming on Dish Network Corp’s Sling TV, a smaller channel bundle delivered over the Internet. “The Walt Disney Company is at the forefront of working with distributors to create new and innovative consumer offerings,” the ESPN spokeswoman said. Verizon has said it believes the company is within its legal rights to offer the new custom packages and will keep selling them. “Nobody likes change and everybody resists change,” Verizon Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said in an interview on Tuesday. “It’s changing the model that’s been existing for twenty-some years. But this is all about the consumer.” On Sunday, Verizon unveiled its new pay TV plan that allows consumers to choose every month bundles of channels they want to see, hoping the flexibility will lure customers away from cable rivals and upstart online TV companies. The new service does not offer “a la carte” programming, or allow customers to build their own pay TV service, channel by channel. But is a step closer to that type of service. U.S. television networks have resisted ‘a la carte’ in favor of packaging less popular channels with the ones that are most watched.

884,VZ,"UPDATE 2-ESPN sues Verizon, escalates battle over new pay-TV offering","(Adds background, details on CBS and analyst quotes) By Jennifer Saba and Malathi Nayak April 27 (Reuters) - ESPN sued Verizon Communications  on Monday for breach of contract involving a new pay-TV offering, as the cable sports network fired the latest volley in a mounting battle with the telecommunications company. ESPN, a division of Walt Disney Co, said in a filing in the Supreme Court of New York State that Verizon violated its obligations “under certain license agreements” and it wants Verizon to pay. The dispute involves Verizon’s new Custom TV service, offering a slimmer package of 36 fixed channels with the option to add on genre-specific packages such as sports, kids or news. It lets subscribers change their packages based on their preferences every month. In traditional subscriptions, customers pay for a large group of networks, often including ESPN. Anthony DiClemente, an analyst at Nomura, said he could not recall seeing a lawsuit like this one. “It’s largely before the papers are signed before the ink is dried on the media contracts we see disputes and blackouts,” he said. “It’s rare there is a lawsuit about a deal that has been agreed upon.” Verizon’s Custom TV is a small step in the direction of letting customers build their own pay-TV service. Media companies have long resisted this partly because of concerns subscribers will drop less popular channels. ESPN and other media companies with a lot of sports content say the package violates their contracts with Verizon. A Verizon spokesman said the company is in compliance of existing agreements. “Consumers have spoken loud and clear that they want choice and the industry should be focused on what the consumer wants and giving them what they want,” he said. ESPN said in a statement, “We simply ask that Verizon abide by the terms of our contracts.” Verizon announced on Monday that programming from CBS Sports Network will be available on Custom TV starting May 1. Twenty-First Century Fox and Comcast’s  NBC Universal also said last week that the new Verizon offering violated the terms of their contracts. It was unclear whether Fox and NBC planned to follow ESPN’s lead and file suit. A spokeswoman for NBC declined to comment and a spokesman for Fox was not immediately available to comment. Verizon will have to depend on ESPN and others to provide content for its new online video service that is expected to release this summer, Craig Moffett, an analyst at MofettNathanson, said.

887,VZ,AOL's Armstrong charted bumpy path to big Verizon sale,"(Reuters) - AOL Inc AOL.N Chief Executive Tim Armstrong’s six year path to transforming the venerable dial-up Internet provider into a marketable mobile ad specialist was filled with bumps. Armstrong spent hundreds of millions on the money-losing hyper local news site Patch. He presided over - or encouraged - the exit of a string of high level executives.  He was inadvertently recorded firing an employee in an audio clip that ricocheted around the Internet. Perhaps most infamously, Armstrong publicly blamed an AOL employee’s “distressed baby” as the reason for the company’s escalating health care costs. But Armstrong appeared vindicated on Tuesday when Verizon agreed to pay $4.4 billion for the company, lauding the company for advertising technology and content for the mobile Web - areas Armstrong focused on. Verizon’s offer - at a premium of more than 17 percent to AOL’s close on Monday - is nearly double the price shares began trading six years ago, and roughly five times the nadir of August 2011.  “He has done a terrific job (for) shareholders,” said one top AOL investor. “The challenge AOL has always had is it’s so small it punched above it’s weight in terms of audience and infrastructure. It’s difficult to fight against the likes of Google.” Himself a former Google executive, Armstrong was tapped to lead AOL in 2009 as Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) prepared to unwind the roughly $162 billion merger from nine years before, widely considered to be one of the most value-destructive in corporate history. The key to his success in retrospect was a series of deals that put a company still heavily dependent on dial-up internet connections on the cutting edge of technology for placing ads. Takeovers like video advertising platform Adap.tv, acquired for $405 million in 2013, gained AOL expertise in automating the process of buying and selling digital advertising.  Armstrong was one of the earliest advocates of “programmatic” ad platforms, essentially automating the process digital advertising in real time that is now fast becoming the main way ads are bought and sold.  “At the end of the day, Tim returned this business to growth, but not where the overall online advertising revenue growth is,” said Ron Josey, an analyst with JMP Securities. Overall U.S. digital adverting grew almost 18 percent in 2014, according to research firm eMarketer. AOL’s 2014 global advertising revenue increased 15 percent. “Most shareholders are likely making money on this. What’s not to like?” Josey said. Armstrong himself is a big winner — he is the 12th largest AOL shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Armstrong also picked a good time to sell, said Daniel Leal, digital media director at ad agency GSD&M;, capitalizing on a moment of attention.  “It was one of the first players and one of the first established in digital and we tend to gravitate towards new offerings,” he said.

889,VZ,Verizon to buy AOL in $4.4 billion mobile video push,"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) is buying AOL Inc AOL.N in a $4.4 billion bet that a push into mobile video and targeted advertising can help the biggest U.S. telecommunications company find new growth avenues.   AOL and its properties, including the Huffington Post, TechCrunch and Engadget websites, would become a Verizon subsidiary, with AOL Chief Executive Officer Tim Armstrong staying in his job. The companies announced the deal on Tuesday. Armstrong, who has been building up AOL’s expertise in technology for placing text and video ads on mobile phones, sees mobile representing 80 percent of media consumption in coming years.  “If we are going to lead, we need to lead in mobile,” Armstrong said in a memo to employees on Tuesday. Global revenue from online video ads is forecast reaching $19 billion by 2017 from about $11 billion last year, cutting into television ad revenue, according to research firm IHS.  Verizon has over 100 million mobile consumers, content deals with the likes of the National Football League and “a meaningful strategy” in mobile video, Armstrong said. It will need to buy telecommunications spectrum aggressively to accommodate rising mobile video traffic.  For Wall Street, the deal is about the technology. “AOL’s ad-tech offering has been driving its growth for some time now as the Internet business has faded,” Dan Ridsdale, an analyst at Edison Investment Research, said in a note to clients. “This acquisition is aimed at enabling Verizon to maximize its revenues from mobile video.” Verizon, which last year bought the assets of OnCue, Intel’s (INTC.O) Internet-based TV platform, has been building a video streaming product to expand beyond slow-growth wireless services.  Verizon’s $50-per-share offer represents a premium of 17.4 percent to AOL’s Monday close. AOL shares jumped 18.4 percent to $50.41, while Dow Jones industrials component Verizon dipped 0.4 percent to $49.63. Armstrong told Reuters that talks between Verizon and AOL started last year. He met with Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam last July about how to further their partnership.  Armstrong said he has a multiyear commitment to stay with Verizon and run AOL as a separate division but declined to give further details.  The proposed acquisition was the latest example of how established telecommunications companies look to make deals to jump-start growth as mobile phone expansion slows. AT&T; Inc (T.N), the second biggest U.S. telecom company, is also betting on video, agreeing to buy No. 1 U.S. satellite TV provider DirecTV DTV.O, for $48.5 billion. The deal is pending.  Advertising has become a major revenue stream for AOL, helped by the acquisition of automated advertising platforms such as Adap.tv. Demand for the real-time bidding platform that helps advertisers place video and display ads helped AOL beat sales and profit forecasts in its most recent quarter. For AOL, the deal caps a years-long period of reinvention into an advertising technology company.  At the peak of the dot-com boom, AOL, whose dial-up Internet service once counted tens of millions of subscribers, used its elevated stock price to buy conglomerate Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) in one of the most disastrous corporate mergers in history.  Spun off from Time Warner in 2009, AOL shares returned to the New York Stock Exchange, opening at $27 in November 2009.  The Verizon bid values AOL below its January 2014 high of $53.28. Shares have fallen in three of the last five quarters but are well above last year’s low of $32.31, leading some analysts to question whether Verizon was overpaying. “There’s the question of whether there is truly an advantage in owning all of this themselves,” said Craig Moffett of media research firm MoffettNathanson. “They are getting a hodgepodge of ancillary assets that may be as much a distraction as a benefit.”  AOL has held talks to spin off Huffington Post as part of the Verizon deal, potentially valuing the news and commentary website at $1 billion, technology news site Re/code reported Tuesday, citing sources.  Verizon viewed Huffington Post and the media brands as an attractive part of the AOL deal and has no immediate plans to sell them or spin them off, a source familiar with the matter said. Verizon was showing signs of desperation as its core wireless business comes under pressure, Macquarie Capital analysts wrote in a note.  “We feel that Verizon paid a hefty price ... for what we believe to be an unproven programmatic ad-tech platform in the nascent video ad-tech space,” they said. Verizon said it expects the deal, which includes about $300 million in AOL debt, to close this summer. LionTree Advisors, Weil Gotshal & Manges and Guggenheim Partners advised Verizon. AOL’s advisers were Allen & Co Llc and Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz.

890,VZ,US STOCKS-Wall St ends weaker as global bond worries deepen,"* AOL jumps to 15-month high on Verizon’s $4.4 bln offer * 10-yr U.S. Treasury yields slip after touching 6-month highs * Higher global bond yields threaten corporate expansion * Indices end lower: Dow 0.2 pct, S&P; 0.29 pct, Nasdaq 0.35 pct   (Updates with close) By Noel Randewich May 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended lower on Tuesday after a recent run-up in global bond yields unsettled investors already concerned about an eventual Federal Reserve interest rate hike. Stocks recovered from steeper losses after Treasury yields crept back slightly from six-month highs. The recent, unexpected leap in yields on U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds has been a thorn in the side of U.S. stock investors for several days. “In the short term, the market is a hostage to interest rates, said Jim Awad, managing director at Plimsoll Mark Capital. “To the extent you have an increase in interest rates that the Fed doesn’t control, you’re getting an unwanted tightening in the financial markets.” Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields touched their highest since mid-November earlier before coming down slightly. Elevated U.S. yields mean higher borrowing costs, which can make it harder for companies to expand. That rise in borrowing costs comes as investors attempt to gauge when the Fed will deem the U.S. economy strong enough to begin raising its own interest rate for the first time since 2006. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 36.94 points, or 0.2 percent, to end at 18,068.23. The S&P; 500 lost 6.21 points, or 0.29 percent, to finish at 2,099.12 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 17.38 points, or 0.35 percent, to 4,976.19. If borrowing costs eventually rise enough to threaten the U.S. economic recovery, the Fed will have few options at its disposal since its key interest rate is already near zero, Awad said. The growing uncertainty about interest rates comes as the S&P; 500 trades near 17 times expected earnings, expensive compared to its 10-year median average of 15 times earnings. AOL shares jumped 18.62 percent to end at $50.52 after Verizon Communications said it would buy the company in a $4.4 billion deal, or $50 per share. Verizon declined 0.36 percent.. Apple, the biggest contributor to losses on the Nasdaq and S&P; 500, dipped 0.36 percent. Eight of the 10 major S&P; 500 sectors were down, with the materials index leading the declines with a 1.03 percent fall. The S&P; energy index gained 0.44 percent as oil prices rose about 3 percent due to a weaker dollar and conflict in Yemen. Pall Corp rose 19.44 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported the water and air filter maker was in the final stages of an auction to sell itself. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,679 to 1,367, for a 1.23-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,556 issues fell and 1,187 advanced for a 1.31-to-1 ratio favoring decliners. The S&P; 500 posted 4 new 52-week highs and 6 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 59 new highs and 60 new lows. About 5.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.8 billion daily average for the last five sessions, according to BATS Global Markets.

Stocks indexes had earlier fallen to their lowest in about a week but bounced back after Treasury yields ticked down slightly from six-month highs. The recent, unexpected leap in yields on U.S. Treasuries and the Germany Bund has been a thorn in the side of U.S. stock investors for several days. “In the short term, the market is a hostage to interest rates, said Jim Awad, managing director at Plimsoll Mark Capital. “To the extent you have an increase in interest rates that the Fed doesn’t control, you’re getting an unwanted tightening in the financial markets.” Benchmark ten-year U.S. Treasury yields touched their highest since mid-November earlier before coming down slightly.

Stocks indexes had earlier fallen to their lowest in about a week but recovered some of those losses after Treasury yields ticked down slightly from six-month highs. The recent, unexpected leap in yields on U.S. Treasuries and the Germany Bund has been a thorn in the side of U.S. stock investors for several days. “In the short term, the market is a hostage to interest rates, said Jim Awad, managing director at Plimsoll Mark Capital. “To the extent you have an increase in interest rates that the Fed doesn’t control, you’re getting an unwanted tightening in the financial markets.” Benchmark ten-year U.S. Treasury yields touched their highest since mid-November earlier in the day before coming down slightly.

Stocks indexes had earlier fallen to their lowest in about a week, tracking European markets amid a global bond rout. Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields, the benchmark for global borrowing costs, touched their highest since mid-November earlier in the day. Elevated U.S. yields mean higher borrowing costs, which can affect stock markets across the world. The government will sell $24 billion in new three-year notes, the first of the $64 billion in new supply this week. Bonds have been the primary driver in the stocks market in recent days. “You can’t have a dramatic move in such a significant part of the capital market without creating ripples elsewhere,” said Erik Davidson, chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank. U.S. small business owners gained confidence in April and were surprisingly bullish about capital expenditure plans, further supporting views that economic growth was rebounding after a dismal first quarter. At 13:25 p.m. ET (1725 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  was down 5.08 points, or 0.03 percent, at 18,100.09, the S&P; 500 was down 2.49 points, or 0.12 percent, at 2,102.84 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 2.86 points, or 0.06 percent, at 4,990.72.

897,VZ,Verizon's top goal with AOL: mobile video advertising,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications has made clear what it hopes to gain with the $4.4 billion purchase of AOL: a better way to sell mobile video ads. AOL, ridiculed for its continuing dial-up Internet business, has in the last few years assembled a set of cutting-edge online video technology tools to buy and sell ads automatically in real-time, measure audience metrics and specifically target users based on their preferences. Such “programmatic” buying is fast becoming the most effective way for online ads to be bought and sold. Verizon, meanwhile, has more than 100 million wireless customers and plans to launch a mobile video service that could be ad-supported.  “The principal interest was around the ad tech platform,” John Stratton, president of operations at Verizon, said at an investors conference on Tuesday after the deal was announced. “You have AOL and the mobile platform of Verizon,” said M.S. Krishnan, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. “They plan to marry the technology and the market space.” Verizon has significant data on its customers and their activity on devices that can be plugged into AOL’s technology to target ads. AOL also competes with Google Inc and Facebook Inc in the business of managing and providing video ads for mobile and desktop website publishers. The Verizon data would allow it to improve targeting on behalf of those publishers as well. “Verizon can append data it has, and has authorization to use in an anonymized fashion, to a digital ad sale, and it will have better insight as to when to buy low and sell high,” said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group said. AOL in 2004 bought advertising network Ad.com, which lets advertisers buy targeted ads across mobile devices and on the Web. Since then it has bought 5min Media, which owns videos that can be placed - along with ads - around the Web, video advertising platform Adap.tv, and Gravity, which tracks users’ interests to target them with relevant ads. With the deal, AOL and Verizon can jointly solve issues related to measurement of ad metrics and targeting, said MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett. Jefferies & Co analyst Mike McCormack said Verizon executives believe AOL can drive “a significant improvement in ad dollars as they move into mobile video”. Revenue in AOL’s ad platform business rose 21 percent to $279.8 million, accounting for 45 percent of total revenue in the first quarter ended March 31. U.S. digital advertising grew almost 18 percent in 2014, according to research firm eMarketer. AOL’s 2014 global advertising revenue was up 15 percent. Ads could be important for Verizon’s plans for a new mobile Web video product - in March, Verizon CFO Fran Shammo told Reuters that the company may rely largely on advertising revenue for such a service launching this summer. Taking on the dominant advertising giants Google and Facebook, though, will not be easy. “(Google) is the 800-pound gorilla,” Pivotal Research’s Wieser said.

899,VZ,Cablevision sues Verizon over commercial targeting FiOS,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cablevision Systems Corp sued Verizon Communications Inc on Tuesday, seeking a judge’s finding that its television commercial claiming Verizon’s FiOS service does not solely use fiber optic cable is truthful. The lawsuit came after Verizon in April launched a proceeding before the Better Business Bureaus’ National Advertising Division challenging the commercial, which claims Verizon’s “100% fiber optics” service actually uses regular cable in the home. In its lawsuit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, Cablevision said Verizon sought to create a “public misconception” that would distinguish its FiOS cable TV and Internet service from Cablevision’s Optimum Online. “Consumers deserve to make informed decisions based on facts, and Cablevision is asking the court to intervene to stop Verizon from attempting to continue to mislead the public,” the company said in a statement. Alberto Canal, a Verizon spokesman, said the lawsuit demonstrated Cablevision’s “appetite for confusing consumers,” and reasserted that Verizon’s FiOS service operated on a 100 percent fiber-optic network. “Since their network can’t compete against FiOS, they resort to legal stunts, which we will challenge vigorously,” he said. In its lawsuit, Cablevision said that, while Verizon advertises FiOS as relying only on fiber optic cable, the company almost always uses regular cable to deliver the service inside homes and to connect to cable modems and television set-top boxes. Cablevision said that was why it ran a commercial in which a voice-over reads: “Verizon claims they’re all fiber optic. True or false? The answer is false.” The commercial added: “Verizon still actually uses regular cable in the home.” In the National Advertising Division proceeding, Verizon is seeking an order directing Cablevision to cease making its advertising claim, the lawsuit said. Cablevision said, however, it will not voluntarily submit to that body’s review. Tuesday’s lawsuit was the latest between the two companies.  In January, Cablevision sued Verizon in federal court in Central Islip, New York, for falsely advertising that its WiFi service is the fastest available. The lawsuit is pending.

908,VZ,UPDATE 1-U.S. FCC may cap small-business discount in airwaves auctions,"(Adds details of AT&T; and Verizon restrictions, and of Dish bidding and next year’s auction, T-Mobile and Wheeler comments; byline) By Alina Selyukh WASHINGTON, June 25 (Reuters) - The Federal Communications Commission is considering capping bidding discounts that small businesses can receive in U.S. auctions of airwaves, after Dish Network Corp partners sought $3 billion in discounts under current rules. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler proposed the agency’s first such cap on Thursday, and also dismissed T-Mobile US Inc’s  request for new limits on how much spectrum dominant carriers Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T; Inc can buy in the next auction in 2016. The proposal, to be voted on at the July 16 meeting, is part of the FCC’s preparation for next year’s auction, expected to be its largest and most complex. Telecom companies will get their first chance since 2008 to buy low-frequency airwaves, highly prized for their ability to carry heavy data over long distances and through obstacles such as buildings. The FCC is expected to decide in coming days whether Dish abused the small-business discount program by investing in companies with little or no revenue that can receive a 25 percent discount as so-called “designated entities.” These companies bid more than $13 billion in the so-called AWS-3 auction that ended in January and sought more than $3 billion in discounts. FCC senior officials on Thursday declined to comment on their review of the Dish partners’ bids. Dish declined to comment. Wheeler’s proposal would cap the discount for small businesses at $150 million and for rural service providers at $10 million for the 2016 auction. It also would prohibit joint bidding agreements that involve a shared bidding strategy and multiple auction applications by parties with common controlling interests, with certain exceptions. “We will not allow small businesses to serve as a stalking horse for another party,” Wheeler said in a blog post. The FCC has also been under pressure from T-Mobile to set aside more airwaves for smaller carriers like itself in next year’s auction. The Department of Justice on Wednesday wrote to the FCC to “give considerable weight” to concerns that biggest wireless carriers may pay up extra to dominate the auction. The agency voted last year to restrict the participation of Verizon and AT&T; in the 2016 spectrum sale by reserving a piece of each market’s airwaves for non-dominant carriers, including T-Mobile and Sprint Corp as AT&T; and Verizon already control the vast majority of low-frequency airwaves. T-Mobile had sought a bigger amount. “Everyone with a wireless phone has a stake in the outcome of this proceeding, and the FCC should heed the calls of DoJ, many in Congress and a slew of consumer groups and move to strengthen the reserve,” Andy Levin, T-Mobile’s senior vice president for government affairs, said in a statement.

Most Americans own a mobile phone and Verizon is looking at offering video content to increase data consumption on mobile devices and grow revenue. The digital video service, which it expects to release this summer, is aimed at families and younger viewers who increasingly view content on mobile devices. The new service will be Verizon’s first foray into mobile video. Companies from Netflix to Dish already offer Web-based video services, but the No. 1 U.S. wireless company has taken a different approach with an ad-supported business model and short-form programming for mobile devices. The video service will be offered through a mobile app, and will include some free sponsored content, Shammo said. “A sponsored data model down the road... that will generate the usage and the eyeballs that are very appealing to advertisers,” Shammo added.  In June, Verizon acquired AOL Inc. for $4.4 billion, making a bet that a push into mobile video and targeted advertising can help it unlock new revenue. Shammo confirmed that the company will use its own rich trove of data on 100 million customers to target ads with the AOL technology. “If you can accumulate customers who are very appealing to advertisers who are more apt to buy a specific product from a specific advertiser, that is more meaningful to an advertiser and they are willing to pay more dollars for that,” he said, adding that Verizon would do so in a way that would not violate customer privacy. “We have a viable 100 million (pairs of) eyeballs on a wireless network that one else can get to but us,” Shammo said.  AOL also competes with Google Inc and Facebook Inc in the business of managing and providing video ads for mobile and desktop website publishers. Verizon’s data would allow it to improve targeting on behalf of those publishers as well. Jefferies & Co analyst Mike McCormack said Verizon has a large user base to target with ads, but noted that customers generally did not like ads. Sponsored content is “more palatable,” McCormack said.

913,VZ,RPT-UPDATE 3-Verizon cuts revenue outlook as price war continues,"(Adds details on industry price war) By Malathi Nayak and Devika  Krishna Kumar July 21 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc on Tuesday lowered its full-year revenue target as it fends promotions from its competitors. Investors shrugged off higher-than-expected second-quarter earnings, which resulted mostly from a jump in tablet subscribers, and sent shares of the largest U.S. wireless service provider down as much as 3 percent. Smaller rivals such as T-Mobile US Inc have stirred up an industry price war, and wireless carriers have been offering heavy promotions and discounts on tablet and phone plans to keep or increase subscribers. The companies have replaced traditional two-year contracts of subsidized phones and tablets with monthly installment plans that have lower service fees. Customers shifted to the installment plans at a higher rate than Verizon had anticipated earlier in the year, resulting in a decline in service revenue, Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said in an interview. Verizon said it expected full-year revenue growth of at least 3 percent, below its previous forecast of 4 percent. Average revenue per user fell 3.8 percent to $153.73 in the quarter from a year earlier and missed the analysts’ average forecast of $154.99, MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett said in a note. Despite pressure on revenue per user, “Verizon’s wireless margins remain the envy of the industry,” Moffett said. Net income attributable to Verizon rose to $4.23 billion, or $1.04 per share, from $4.21 billion, or $1.02 per share. Analysts on average were expecting $1.01 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue increased to $32.22 billion from $31.48 billion, below analysts’ estimates of $32.87 billion. Verizon added a net 1.1 million wireless retail postpaid subscribers, who pay each billing cycle based on usage. That met estimates from analysts polled by market research firm FactSet StreetAccount. Net tablet additions came to 852,000. Customer defections at Verizon’s wireless postpaid business fell to a three-year low of 0.90 percent, while FactSet had expected 0.99 percent. Revenue from Verizon’s FiOS high-speed Internet, TV and phone service rose 10 percent to $3.4 billion. After its $4.4 billion purchase of AOL Inc in June, Verizon is gearing up to introduce its online video service to generate new revenue from mobile video and targeted advertising.

919,VZ,Verizon wireline workers authorize strike amid contract negotiations,"NEW YORK, July 24 (Reuters) - Verizon Communication Inc’s  wireline unit workers on the U.S. East Coast have voted to go on strike, if needed, amid contract negotiations, the unions representing them said on Saturday. At a rally in New York, the unions announced that 86 percent of Verizon’s 39,000 wireline employees have voted to authorize a strike. This comes a week before their current contracts expire on Aug. 1. The vote to strike does not mean work in the wireline business, which includes FiOS Internet, telephone and TV services,  will come to a halt as the board of the unions Communications Workers of America (CWA) and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers that represent the employees have yet to approve it. “Our members are clear and they are determined - they reject management’s harsh concessionary demands, including the elimination of job security, sharp increases in workers’ health care costs, and slashing retirement security,” Vice President for CWA District One Dennis Trainor said in a statement. The company’s union-represented employees in the East work under 27 collective bargaining agreements in nine eastern states in the United States and Washington D.C. Verizon’s plans to cut costs by conrolling healthcare and pension-related benefits over a three-year period are at the center of union negotiations. “Union rallies and strike authorization votes are useless distractions that achieve nothing,” Verizon spokesman Rich Young said. “We believe their time would be far more beneficial focusing on the important contractual issues that need to be resolved.” Verizon said in late June it offered salary hikes to 39,000 employees in its East wireline business after its first negotiating session with representatives of the two unions. The wage increases were subject to an agreement between the company and the unions. In 2011, the last round of talks had ended in a strike.

929,VZ,"UPDATE 2-U.S. FCC rejects T-Mobile request to limit spectrum for Verizon, AT&T;","(Adds T-Mobile CEO comments) By Alina Selyukh WASHINGTON, Aug 6 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Thursday denied T-Mobile US Inc’s  request that more airwaves be set aside for smaller wireless companies like itself to bid on during a government auction next year. The unanimous vote by the five-member commission came after months of T-Mobile’s lobbying for stricter limits for AT&T; Inc’s  and Verizon Communications Inc’s participation in the auction of prized low-frequency airwaves. Reuters previously reported that agency staff had found existing restrictions were sufficient to ensure that smaller carriers get a chance to outbid Verizon and AT&T;, which dominate those low frequencies. The auction, tentatively slated to start in March, will be a landmark one for the U.S. wireless industry as it will give participants their first chance since 2008 to buy low-frequency airwaves, which are valued for their ability to carry heavy data over long distances and through obstacles such as buildings. The FCC voted last year to curb participation of carriers that held dominant slices of low-frequency airwaves in each market by reserving a piece of spectrum for bidding only by non-dominant carriers, but not to the extent T-Mobile sought.

T-Mobile Chief Executive Officer John Legere on Twitter played down the policy loss, touting the existence of the reserved spectrum in the first place. “Good news - the reserve includes great quality spectrum & looks like the FCC will be monitoring closely so duopoly can’t game the system,” Legere tweeted, referring to the top two U.S. carriers, Verizon and AT&T.; He said T-Mobile was committed to “showing up, playing hard and being successful at the auction.” T-Mobile shares were down 1.2 percent at $40.24 in afternoon trading, while Verizon dipped 0.6 percent and AT&T; fell 1.6 percent.

The unanimous vote by the five-member commission came after months of T-Mobile’s lobbying for stricter limits for AT&T; Inc’s  and Verizon Communications Inc’s participation in the auction of prized low-frequency airwaves. Reuters previously reported that agency staff had found existing restrictions were sufficient to ensure that smaller carriers get a chance to outbid AT&T; and Verizon, which dominate those low frequencies. The auction, tentatively slated to start in March, will be a landmark one for the U.S. wireless industry as it will give participants their first chance since 2008 to buy low-frequency airwaves, which are valued for their ability to carry heavy data over long distances and through obstacles such as buildings. The FCC voted last year to curb participation of carriers that held dominant slices of low-frequency airwaves in each market by reserving a piece of spectrum for bidding only by non-dominant carriers, but not to the extent T-Mobile sought. The vote was something of a compromise among the FCC’s Democrats, who wanted to give smaller carriers a leg up while ensuring that restrictions on the big carriers would not cut the proceeds of the auction, expected to be the agency’s largest. T-Mobile representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The ruling on Monday by U.S. Magistrate Judge Gary Brown in Central Islip, New York, comes days after he ruled against Cablevision’s own bid to block Verizon from advertising that it had the “fastest WiFi available” for misleading consumers. Brown said his ruling on Friday meant that Verizon was not lying to the public by claiming its FiOS fiber optic network provides the fastest WiFi. Cablevision’s advertising campaign, which it launched after filing a lawsuit against Verizon in January, was “literally untrue and implicitly false” and was likely to mislead consumers, Brown said at a court hearing, according to a transcript, which was made public on Tuesday. Initial print advertisements featured Verizon representatives with their “pants on fire” or as Pinocchio, the fictional children’s character prone to lying. While Cablevision told the judge in July it would voluntarily discontinue those advertisements, it notified the court of plans to air new ads, including one with a sheriff telling Verizon that “this town’s had enough of your lies.” Brown found Cablevision’s claims of lying to be false and imposed a temporary restraining order requiring Cablevision to stop running ads accusing Verizon being a “liar,” having “crooked facts” or otherwise being dishonest by Friday. “The law, like our economic system, encourages spirited competition,” Brown said. “But when a competitor exceeds the bounds of decency by falsely impugning the integrity of a competitor, it runs afoul of the law.” Susan Retta, Verizon vice president of consumer marketing, welcomed the ruling, saying Cablevision’s advertising was “nothing but a campaign to keep accurate and factual information away from consumers.” Lisa Anselmo, a Cablevision spokeswoman, said the company would continue to challenge Verizon’s claims, “not only through the legal system but also in the court of public opinion.” In his Friday ruling, Brown also rejected Verizon’s effort to block various other advertising claims by its rival as untrue, including regarding how many hotspots it offers.

934,VZ,Verizon launches trial of mobile video service in test for telecom industry,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc will launch a trial version of its new mobile video service on Tuesday, aiming to prove that telecom players can compete with mobile ad industry titans Google Inc and Facebook Inc. Verizon said its service, a mobile app dubbed “go90”, will be offered initially to a select set of its own customers, with advertisements from well-known brands, which it declined to name, but without newly acquired ad technology from AOL, the media company it bought in June for $4.4 billion. Verizon is targeting young viewers or millennials with about 100 to 200 hours of exclusive content from online video networks such as AwesomenessTV and Machinima, said Brian Angiolet, Verizon’s senior vice president, consumer products. The free service will drive revenue from data usage and targeted advertising.  Verizon’s best chance to prove its advertising potential rests on technology from AOL, which has built tools to deliver targeted Web and mobile ads. That, combined with Verizon’s customer data, should improve targeting, analysts say.  The AOL technology is in the process of being integrated with Verizon’s video service, and targeted advertising tools will be available over time, Angiolet said.  The service will launch officially to all users as soon as later this month, a Verizon spokesman said.      Companies from Netflix Inc to Dish Network Corp  already offer Web-based video services through subscriptions, but the No. 1 U.S. wireless company’s ad-supported, short-form video model is unusual. Go90 pits Verizon against Internet advertising industry heavyweights Google and Facebook, and advertisers will take a “wait and see” approach to determine how many viewers Verizon captures, telecom industry consultant Tim Farrar said. “Pretty much without exception telecom operators have not been successful as third parties in exploiting the Internet access service, whether it’s video or anything else,” Farrar said. “What percentage of people’s app viewing is going to be over a Verizon app versus YouTube or Facebook...That’s the biggest uncertainty.” Verizon’s rival AT&T; Inc has said it has mobile video services targeting young viewers in the works. Smaller rivals Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc have said they are watching their competitors’ efforts closely. Verizon is in talks with advertisers and brands about content sponsorships and original-content creation, Angiolet said. The service lets users post comments, form interest-based groups and clip and share videos in social networks, he added. Verizon’s video strategy “holds genuine promise,” MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett said in a recent note. Verizon is currently the only video service to offer advertisers customer data “based on location, at the personal level rather than the household level, with unprecedented knowledge of purchase intent and a wealth of demographic and prior purchase information,” Moffett said. Verizon’s content portfolio will evolve in coming months, executives have said. Previously, Verizon said its upcoming digital video service will offer content from the National Football League, DreamWorks Animation’s AwesomenessTV unit and Vice Media.

936,VZ,Verizon says TV streaming could be added to new mobile video service,"LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - If Verizon’s new mobile video service go90 succeeds in grabbing the attention of millenials who increasingly watch content on mobile devices, a streaming option for TVs could be next. Verizon Communications Inc, the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier, launched a trial of its free, ad-supported mobile video product, an app that offers live events, on-demand shows and Web videos, on Tuesday.  Companies such as Netflix Inc and Hulu that offer Web-based video services have put pressure on traditional pay-TV companies that are struggling to add viewers. With go90, Verizon, which also offers a separate pay-TV service through its FiOS unit, has taken a different approach by introducing an ad-supported, short-form mobile video service.  “We said, Let’s start with a mobile-first product,” Marni Walden, Verizon’s president of product innovation and new businesses, told Reuters on Thursday. “The thought is that there could be a companion product that would come at some point in the future that could be in-home” for TVs.    Verizon wanted to leverage its mobile network to stand out in a crowded streaming video market, Walden said. Dish Network Corp and Sony Corp also offer online video services. On Wednesday, Apple Inc announced an improved version of its set-top box, Apple TV, without details on new content agreements. “Our focus is all on our mobile product today,” Walden said. “We have to be successful with this product first and then we would have the right to say, ‘Yes, let’s go do the companion.’”    Go90 was developed from OnCue video streaming technology, which Verizon purchased from Intel Corp in 2014.   “We don’t believe trying to replace linear TV is the right thing,” Walden said. “We don’t think the initial model we saw in Intel Media with $80 broadband and $80 content was one we could win at, particularly with all of the clutter and noise in that same space.” Go90’s content partners include the National Football League, VH1, the Food Network and ESPN. From the Web, it will offer videos from Maker Studios, Machinima and AwesomenessTV, among others.  Verizon is also considering letting users create content in the future, Walden said. Go90 will use Verizon’s multicast video technology that streams live events to multiple mobile devices through a single lane of airwaves. Moving forward, Verizon aspires to relay events to a global audience, although that would require negotiating streaming rights, Walden said.

938,VZ,Verizon first to offer cellphone roaming in Cuba,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc announced on Thursday it would begin to offer roaming wireless service in Cuba next week, becoming the first U.S. company to do so. The announcement by the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier follows the restoration of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States in July after 54 years. The United States has set connectivity as a priority in its new relationship with the communist-run island. The news came on the same day Cuba said its first ambassador to the United States since 1961 had presented his credentials at the White House. Telecommunications equipment, technology and services were among the first exemptions to a U.S. economic embargo of the island after Washington and Havana announced plans to restore diplomatic relations in December. Verizon will charge $2.99 per minute for voice calls and $2.05 per megabyte for data, making the option an expensive one. Currently, visiting Americans must purchase a pay-as-you-go cell phone through state telephone company Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Cuba SA (ETECSA) to have cellular service on the island, or have a cellphone account in a third country. ETECSA does not offer data. Boost Mobile, part of Sprint Corp, in April launched a prepaid plan for U.S. consumers calling and texting Cuba. In March, U.S.-based IDT Corp reached an agreement with ETECSA to provide direct international long-distance service. Previously phone communication between the two countries had to pass through third countries. Scarcely 2 million people out of Cuba’s population of 11 million have cell phones.

940,VZ,Verizon says earnings may 'plateau' in 2016,"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) said earnings may “plateau” next year as evolving consumer habits drive changes to its wireless business model and as the telecom company forays into new markets such as mobile video amid stiff competition. Verizon, the largest U.S. wireless service provider, said the results would also be hit by the planned sale of some wireline assets and a focus on new business models for wireless video and “Internet of Things”. Analysts on average were expecting Verizon’s net profit to grow about 2 percent in 2016. The company said it would return to growth in 2017, but still investors sent the company’s shares down as much as 3.6 percent on Thursday. Customers are increasingly moving away from traditional two-year contracts for subsidized mobile devices to monthly installment plans that have lower service fees. “The goal is future growth based on delivering what customers want and need in the new digital world,” Verizon Chief Executive Lowell McAdam said at an investor conference. But Jefferies analyst Mike McCormack said Verizon had been a “laggard” in adapting to changing needs. Smaller players such as T-Mobile US Inc TMUS.N lured away customers offering heavy promotions and discounts on subscription plans. “ ... And that’s where I think you’re going to see at least a good 4-6 quarters of really sluggish ARPA growth (at Verizon) which is obviously going to be an impact the EPS,” McCormack said. ARPA is average revenue per account. McCormack said AT&T; Inc (T.N), the No. 2 U.S. carrier, had moved customers to new plans last year ahead of Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) iPhone upgrade. AT&T; shares fell as much 1.6 percent. Apple’s own financing plan for the new iPhones is expected to pile more pressure on U.S. carriers. But, Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche said Apple’s move was not a near-term threat and could even help Verizon’s cash flow. Verizon’s 2016 results will also be affected by the sale of some wireline assets to Frontier Communications Corp (FTR.O), a  expected to close in the first half of 2016. These assets generate good margin and cash flow for Verizon, said Morningstar analyst Michael Hodel. The company has also been betting on “Internet of Things”, the concept of connecting household devices to the Internet, to drive revenue and profit. “Ultimately, we don’t believe Verizon’s long-term potential and competitive position has changed much despite the changes taking place across the company and across the industry,” Hodel said.

The U.S. Federal Communications Commission is gearing up to auction off valuable 600 megahertz airwaves that can travel long distances and penetrate buildings, to wireless carriers, which are clamoring for faster speeds for data-guzzling customers. Sprint will not participate as its current holdings of airwaves are “sufficient” for its ongoing network upgrade effort and to serve customers in the future, it said in a statement, making it the first U.S carrier to announce it will sit out of the auction. “Sprint’s focus and overarching imperative must be on improving its network and market position in the immediate term so we can remain a powerful force in fostering competition,” Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure, said in the statement. “Sprint has the spectrum it needs to deploy its network architecture of the future.” Investors have been concerned about financial health of Sprint, the no.4 U.S. wireless carrier based on subscribers, which has struggled to report a profit in recent years. Sprint burned $2.2 billion in cash in the second quarter ended June 30. It is locked in an aggressive price war with its rivals, Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T; Inc and T-Mobile US Inc, which are going after each others’ subscribers with deep discounts and promotions that have weighed on growth. Sprint also skipped the airwaves auction called the “AWS-3” spectrum sale that concluded earlier this year.

Excluding items, the company earned $1.04 per share, slightly higher than the average analyst forecast of $1.02, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total operating revenue rose 5 percent to $33.16 billion, beating analysts’ expectations of $32.94 billion. The saturated wireless market has triggered a battle for subscribers among U.S. wireless carriers. Verizon’s smaller rivals T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp have  aggressively rolled out lower-priced offerings and deals, such as Sprint’s $1 iPhone 6s leasing plan, to lure customers. Verizon, the No.1 U.S.wireless company, has tackled competition through tablet deals and data offers to add subscribers. Verizon added 1.3 million net wireless retail postpaid subscribers in the third quarter, surpassing the average analyst estimate of 1.2 million, according to market research firm FactSet StreetAccount. “Verizon is letting customers use more and more data and they are charging them more on their network, so that leads to higher margins,” Drexel Hamilton analyst Barry Sine said. “Overall, you have to give them high marks for the quarter.” Tablet net adds were 818,000 in the quarter. Postpaid phone net adds were 430,000. “They have been promotional, but churn (customer defections) remains low,” MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett said in a note. Verizon shares, which have fallen about 4.5 percent this year, were up about 1 percent at 45.64 in Tuesday morning. Like its rivals, Verizon has switched from offering customers two-year contracts to monthly installment plans that have lower service fees. Verizon’s retail postpaid average revenue per account (ARPA) slid to $152.38 from $161.24 a year ago. As the new billing plan separates device and service costs, it hurts ARPA. Verizon’s customer base is transitioning to installment plans and it expects earnings to begin rising again “some time in mid-to-late 2016,” Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said in an interview. Verizon is investing in new markets such as mobile video and connected cars. Twenty days since the launch of its millenial-centric go90 mobile video service, Verizon is seeing “very encouraging feedback,” Shammo said on an earnings call. Sales from FiOS high-speed Internet, TV and phone service rose 7.5 percent from a year earlier to $3.4 billion. Verizon reiterated that it expects revenue growth of at least 3 percent in 2015.

Third-quarter company earnings are in focus this week, with investors keeping an eye on revenue growth and outlook commentary on the effects of a global economic slowdown. S&P; 500 companies are expected to show a 3.9 percent fall in third-quarter profit while revenue is expected to fall 3.8 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. “It is topline growth that is making these companies and the market see-saw back and forth as they report,” said Chris Bertelsen, chief investment officer at Global Financial Private Capital. “They can’t get away with just bottom line good numbers anymore because everyone’s looking for growth,” Bertelsen said.

IBM fell nearly 6 percent to $140.86 after it reported a bigger-than-expected fall in quarterly revenue. Travelers rose 2.2 percent to $108.65 after the insurer’s quarterly profit topped estimates, helped by higher underwriting gains. At 10:59 a.m. ET (1459 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was up 25.29 points, or 0.15 percent, at 17,255.83, the S&P; 500 was up 3.97 points, or 0.2 percent, at 2,037.63 and the Nasdaq composite index was down 2.44 points, or 0.05 percent, at 4,903.04.

Of the S&P; 500 companies that have reported until Friday, 43 percent have beaten expectations on revenue, according to Thomson Reuters data. About 60 percent companies on average beat sales estimates in a quarter. U.S. stocks closed with slight gains on Monday as tech and biotech stocks advanced ahead of a heavy week of earnings.

953,VZ,Verizon says Internet of Things revenue at $500 million year-to-date,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) is trying to pave the way for developers to connect more devices to the Web, as its “Internet of Things” business has touched $500 million so far this year, an executive said on Wednesday. Aimed at connecting to the Internet everything from household devices to industrial machines, the business is growing at a “double-digit” rate, Mike Lanman, senior vice president of enterprise products at Verizon said at an event in San Francisco.  “A large portion of our revenue comes through connectivity but a significant part of it comes from the application layer already,” he said in a phone interview after introducing a platform to help customers develop applications in healthcare, agriculture, utilities and connected cars. Last year, Verizon’s annual revenue from the business totaled $585 million. As the market for smartphones and mobile devices gets saturated, Verizon and its biggest rival AT&T; Inc (T.N) are hoping that connecting more objects and appliances to their networks will provide an avenue for growth.  The global Internet of Things market is expected to grow to $1.7 trillion in 2020 from $656 billion in 2014, according to market research firm IDC. Examples include Verizon’s fleet management tracking application and a partnership with Intel Corp (INTC.O) to provide water management sensors in vineyards, Lanman said. At the event, Verizon also unveiled a chip that Lanman said halves the cost of connecting low data usage devices like dog trackers to high-speed networks.  AT&T; has also been working on growing its “Internet of Things” business and previously launched initiatives such as a cloud-based data-analytics platform for companies and a global SIM card for connected cars.

958,VZ,Exclusive: Verizon weighing $10 billion sale of enterprise assets - sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc is exploring a sale of its enterprise assets which could be worth as much as $10 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, as the largest U.S. wireless carrier seeks to focus on its core business. The sale would include the business formerly known as MCI, which provides landline and Internet services for large business customers, as well as Terremark, its data center unit, the people said this week. The businesses have struggled to keep up with advances in cloud computing, and face fierce price competition from players such as Alphabet Inc and Amazon.com Inc. Verizon’s enterprise assets might not be easy to separate and any potential buyer would likely have to sign commercial agreements with the company, some of the people said. Verizon is still considering how some of these asset sales could best be structured and no deal is imminent, the people added. Wireline provider CenturyLink Inc was in talks with Verizon earlier this year to buy some of the assets but could not agree on terms, the people said. In a strategy shift, CenturyLink announced this week it would instead explore options for some of its data centers, including possibly selling them. Citigroup Inc has been advising Verizon on the possible sale of the assets, which have estimated annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of around $2 billion, the people added. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Verizon, CenturyLink and Citigroup declined to comment. The enterprise telecommunications industry has had to adapt in recent years to corporate customers seeking more sophisticated and cheaper offerings to manage their data.  AT&T; Inc has been exploring a sale of its data center assets for some time, while Windstream Holdings Inc sold its data center business for $575 million to TierPoint last month. Verizon Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said, during the company’s third-quarter earnings call on Oct. 20, that it continues “to work through secular and economic challenges” with its global enterprise division, which posted a 4.9 percent decline in revenue in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Verizon’s $8.4 billion acquisition of MCI was completed in 2006 following a fierce bidding war with Qwest Communications, which is now part of CenturyLink. It acquired Terremark Worldwide Inc in 2011 for $1.4 billion.  Verizon has been looking to sell other non-core assets as well. In February, it announced the sale of residential landline assets to Frontier Communications for $10.54 billion, and unloaded its tower portfolio for more than $5 billion.

961,VZ,Yahoo shares rise as board meets and considers sale of Web business,"(Reuters) - Plans by Yahoo Inc’s YHOO.O board to consider selling its struggling Internet business sent the company’s shares up more than 5 percent on Wednesday, as investors cheered a potential new way to separate Yahoo’s traditional services from its valuable investment in Chinese Web merchant Alibaba. Yahoo’s board will weigh a sale of the Internet business at a three-day board meeting starting on Wednesday, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday. Chief Executive Marissa Mayer’s attempts to revive the traditional business have born little fruit, and almost all of Yahoo’s market capitalization of about $34 billion is ascribed to its stakes in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Holding Group Ltd (BABA.N) and Yahoo Japan Corp (4689.T). A separate Alibaba stake would be expected to be more highly valued by the market, but investors want to avoid a massive tax bill in the process. Selling the traditional business is seen as one way possibly to achieve that. Broken out as a separate company, Yahoo’s email, Yahoo and Tumblr web sites and mobile services could fetch between $2 billion and $8 billion, analysts and bankers said, many seeing $4 billion as the likely price. If Yahoo sells off its traditional web business all that would be left, essentially, is the Alibaba and Yahoo Japan stakes. “Realizing value is far from assured, however,” Pivotal analyst Brian Wieser wrote in a note. “The big question is whether anyone would actually show up with a meaningful bid.” Interested bidders could range from private equity companies aiming to refocus Yahoo to technology companies eager for Yahoo’s mobile and web content, following the model of Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) buying AOL. The Wall Street Journal said potential bidders could include Verizon and IAC/InterActiveCorp IACI.O. A source familiar with Verizon’s thinking said currently there were no talks between the companies. IAC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Journal, which first reported that Yahoo might sell its Internet business, also reported on Tuesday that the board meeting would discuss how to proceed with the spinoff of the company’s 15 percent stake in Alibaba, worth more than $30 billion if held separately.  Yahoo’s Internet business has been struggling to boost revenue from ad sales in the face of stiff competition from Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google and Facebook (FB.O). According to a person familiar with the matter, activist investor Starboard Value LP is also disappointed in Yahoo’s performance under Mayer and has lost confidence in the CEO. Starboard attributes the relatively low price of the Internet business to poor management of the division by Mayer and the Yahoo management team.  The company’s emerging businesses, which Mayer calls Mavens - mobile, video, native and social advertising - have been the bright spot for the company. “To me that would be most valuable to sell,” said Ivan Feinseth, an analyst at Tigress Financial Partners. “I think private equity would be interested in the Mavens businesses,” he said. Starboard asked Yahoo in November to drop plans to spin off its stake in Alibaba due to the tax concerns, and urged the company to sell its core search and display advertising businesses instead.

962,VZ,UPDATE 2-Yahoo shares rise as board meets and considers sale of Web business,"(Adds source on Starboard view of Mayer, move on valuation of Yahoo Web business) By Anya George Tharakan and Liana B. Baker Dec 2 (Reuters) - Plans by Yahoo Inc’s board to consider selling its struggling Internet business sent the company’s shares up more than 5 percent on Wednesday, as investors cheered a potential new way to separate Yahoo’s traditional services from its valuable investment in Chinese Web merchant Alibaba. Yahoo’s board will weigh a sale of the Internet business at a three-day board meeting starting on Wednesday, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday. Chief Executive Marissa Mayer’s attempts to revive the traditional business have born little fruit, and almost all of Yahoo’s market capitalization of about $34 billion is ascribed to its stakes in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Holding Group Ltd and Yahoo Japan Corp. A separate Alibaba stake would be expected to be more highly valued by the market, but investors want to avoid a massive tax bill in the process. Selling the traditional business is seen as one way possibly to achieve that. Broken out as a separate company, Yahoo’s email, Yahoo and Tumblr web sites and mobile services could fetch between $2 billion and $8 billion, analysts and bankers said, many seeing $4 billion as the likely price. If Yahoo sells off its traditional web business all that would be left, essentially, is the Alibaba and Yahoo Japan stakes. “Realizing value is far from assured, however,” Pivotal analyst Brian Wieser wrote in a note. “The big question is whether anyone would actually show up with a meaningful bid.” Interested bidders could range from private equity companies aiming to refocus Yahoo to technology companies eager for Yahoo’s mobile and web content, following the model of Verizon Communications Inc buying AOL. The Wall Street Journal said potential bidders could include Verizon and IAC/InterActiveCorp. A source familiar with Verizon’s thinking said currently there were no talks between the companies. IAC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Journal, which first reported that Yahoo might sell its Internet business, also reported on Tuesday that the board meeting would discuss how to proceed with the spinoff of the company’s 15 percent stake in Alibaba, worth more than $30 billion if held separately. Yahoo’s Internet business has been struggling to boost revenue from ad sales in the face of stiff competition from Alphabet Inc’s Google and Facebook. According to a person familiar with the matter, activist investor Starboard Value LP is also disappointed in Yahoo’s performance under Mayer and has lost confidence in the CEO. Starboard attributes the relatively low price of the Internet business to poor management of the division by Mayer and the Yahoo management team. The company’s emerging businesses, which Mayer calls Mavens - mobile, video, native and social advertising - have been the bright spot for the company. “To me that would be most valuable to sell,” said Ivan Feinseth, an analyst at Tigress Financial Partners. “I think private equity would be interested in the Mavens businesses,” he said. Starboard asked Yahoo in November to drop plans to spin off its stake in Alibaba due to the tax concerns, and urged the company to sell its core search and display advertising businesses instead.

967,VZ,U.S. appeals court hears challenge to net neutrality rules,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court heard arguments on Friday over the legality of the Federal Communications Commission’s net neutrality rules, in a case that may ultimately determine how consumers get access to content on the Internet. The fight is the latest battle over Obama administration rules requiring broadband providers to treat all data equally, rather than giving or selling access to a so-called Web “fast lane.” A three-judge panel, in a hearing that lasted over three hours, questioned lawyers for the FCC and broadband backers about whether the FCC properly extended the sweeping authority it has to regulate telecommunications to Internet service providers. So-called net neutrality is a major issue for broadband providers like Verizon Communications Inc and Comcast Corp, which fear the rules may make it harder to manage Internet traffic and make investment to provide additional capacity less likely. It is also a big concern for content providers like Netflix Inc and Yelp Inc, worried that access to customers could be limited without net neutrality. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has ruled twice against the FCC since 2010 and Judge David Tatel, who wrote both opinions, is on the panel that heard the case. The issue, Tatel said, is whether the FCC had authority to reclassify the Internet as a more heavy-regulated telecommunications service rather than an information service. Lawyers for the Internet service providers argued that because they exercise some control over functions like cached pages they met the burden as an information service provider, which would limit how extensively the FCC could impose net neutrality rules. But the FCC said broadband providers were acting merely to transport data, not making content decisions. An open Internet spurs innovation and helps improve broadband infrastructure, the FCC argued, saying network companies plowed $230 billion into the Web over 2011-2013, when open Internet rules were in effect. Judge Tatel wrote the majority opinion in 2010 ruling against the FCC after it cited Comcast for slowing Internet traffic speeds to some customers who were downloading very large data files from peer-to-peer networks. The FCC then issued new rules that blocked broadband providers from slowing or discriminating against Internet traffic and Tatel wrote the opinion that blocked those rules in 2014.  Congress has considered writing its own rules on net neutrality but has not voted on any proposals. The appeals court ruled in 2014 that the FCC had used the wrong legal reasoning to issue the rules, but said without net neutrality “broadband providers represent a threat to Internet openness.” The net neutrality rules are backed by the American Civil Liberties Union, library groups and companies including Twitter Inc, Medium, Yelp, Reddit.

969,VZ,U.S. court to hear challenge to net neutrality rules,"WASHINGTON, Dec 4 (Reuters) - A three-judge U.S. appeals court panel on Friday will consider whether the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) net neutrality rules are legal, hearing arguments from major cable and telecommunications trade associations and AT&T; Inc. The fight is the latest challenge to Obama administration rules requiring broadband providers to treat all data equally, rather than giving or selling access to a Web fast lane. Such so-called net neutrality is a major issue for broadband providers like Verizon Communications Inc, Comcast Corp  and others who fear the rules may make it harder to manage Internet traffic and make it less likely providers will invest to provide additional capacity. It is also a major issue for content providers like Netflix Inc to Yelp Inc  who fear that they could see access to customers limited without net neutrality. The appeals court has ruled twice against the FCC since 2010, and Judge David Tatel, who wrote both opinions, is on the panel sitting on Friday. He is joined by judges appointed by presidents Barack Obama and Ronald Reagan. They will consider FCC rules set in February that bar “blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization” by broadband providers. An open Internet spurs innovation and helps improve broadband infrastructure, the FCC argued, saying network companies ploughed $230 billion into the Web over 2011-2013, when open Internet rules were in effect. But supporters of broadband providers in a legal brief called the rules “a naked effort by the agency to achieve its desired result.” The FCC has classified the Internet as a utility, but broadband providers argue regulators “can’t interpret the term ‘land vehicles’ to include ‘boats.’” Legal experts are divided about how the court may rule. Former FCC Commissioner Robert McDowell, who served from 2006-2013, said the FCC “overreached” and argued the court was “highly likely” to overturn the FCC decision. Cardozo law professor Michael Burstein, who filed briefs in support of the FCC, said the case won’t hinge on whether net neutrality is a good or bad idea but on whether the agency had the authority to make the rules and if they violate the First Amendment. Judge Tatel wrote the majority opinion in 2010 ruling against the FCC after it cited Comcast for slowing Internet traffic speeds to some customers who were downloading very large data files from peer-to-peer networks.

The companies filed a joint legal brief warning freedom of speech online “is at risk if broadband providers get to block or limit access to those voices they decide to disfavor - and that is exactly what petitioners are fighting for the right to do.”   (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Christopher Cushing)",12042015,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-internet/u-s-court-to-hear-challenge-to-net-neutrality-rules-idUSL1N13R22Z20151204

979,VZ,Exclusive: Verizon launches auction to sell data centers - sources,"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) has started a process to sell its data center assets, hoping to fetch more than $2.5 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, as the U.S. telecommunications conglomerate focuses on its core business. A sale would represent the latest effort by Verizon, the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier, to streamline its portfolio following a divestment last year of a chunk of its landline business and a portfolio of wireless towers.  It would also mark a reversal of its strategy to expand in hosting and colocation services after it acquired data center operator Terremark Worldwide Inc in 2011 for $1.4 billion. The so-called ‘colocation’ portfolio up for sale includes 48 data centers, and generates annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of around $275 million, one of the people said. Citigroup Inc (C.N) is advising Verizon on the possible sale of its data centers, the people added. The sources asked not to be identified because the auction is confidential. Verizon and Citigroup declined to comment. Verizon initially explored a sale of a larger portion of its enterprise business, including the former MCI assets, but could not reach an agreement with a buyer. It held discussions with wireline provider CenturyLink Inc (CTL.N) last year for its enterprise business, Reuters reported in November. The enterprise telecommunications industry has had to adapt in recent years to corporate customers seeking more sophisticated and cheaper offerings to manage their data. Verizon joins a host of its rivals in telecommunications who are shedding their data centers.  AT&T; Inc (T.N) has been exploring a sale of its data center assets since last year, while CenturyLink announced in November 2015 that it was exploring strategic alternatives for its data centers. Windstream Holdings Inc (WIN.O) also sold its data center business for $575 million to TierPoint last year.  Verizon has been facing stiff competition from companies such as T-Mobile US Inc TMUS.N and Sprint Corp (S.N), which have been offering deep discounts on cellphone and data plans.

983,VZ,Verizon adds 1.5 million new monthly users; revenue beats estimates,"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc on Thursday reported higher-than-expected revenue for the fourth quarter as heavy promotions helped it counter aggressive offers and discounts from rivals and win new users. Shares of the No. 1 U.S. wireless phone service provider, whose profit edged past analysts’ estimates, rose 2.7 percent to $45.63 in morning trading.  Verizon added a net 1.5 million wireless retail postpaid, or monthly, subscriptions in the quarter, below 2 million a year earlier but above the analysts’ average estimate of 1.42 million, according to market research firm FactSet StreetAccount. The company, known for its high-quality network, withstood stiff competition from rivals in the saturated U.S. wireless market. Smaller rival Sprint Corp offered 50 percent off to encourage users to switch to its network, and T-Mobile US Inc launched a free video streaming plan. For its part, Verizon rolled out holiday season offers such as a data giveaway on some plans, $100 discounts on certain phones and a $300 credit to trade in some models.  Customer defections, or churn, in Verizon’s postpaid business fell to 0.96 percent from 1.14 percent a year earlier.  Average revenue per account, however, fell 6.6 percent to $148.30, below the analysts’ forecast of $149.61, according to FactSet. Jefferies analyst Mike McCormack said Verizon must curb such declines in this measure this year. Like its rivals, Verizon has switched from offering customers two-year contracts to monthly installment plans that have lower service fees and can weigh on revenue.  To increase revenue, Verizon is investing in its new “go90” mobile-video service and “Internet of Things,” which connects everything from industrial machines to household devices to the Internet. Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said in an interview that the company still expected full-year earnings growth, excluding special items, to be on “a flatter plateau” in 2016 than 2015 as a result of those investments and the shift to the installment model.  Revenue from Internet of Things-related offerings rose about 18 percent to $690 million in 2015.  In the quarter, sales at the company’s FiOS high-speed Internet, TV and phone service rose 6.8 percent to $3.53 billion. Net income attributable to Verizon was $5.39 billion, or $1.32 per share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $2.23 billion, or 54 cents per share.

988,VZ,UPDATE 2-U.S. proposes TV set-top box competition to let in new players,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday proposed competition in the pay television set-top box market, a move that could let consumers swap costly cable industry boxes for cheaper service through devices like tablets. FCC chairman Tom Wheeler unveiled the proposed regulation later to let customers get video services from providers like Alphabet Inc, Tivo and Apple instead of cable, satellite and other television providers like Comcast, Verizon and Dish, according to the proposal, which will be voted on Feb. 18. The FCC says Americans spent $20 billion a year to lease pay-TV boxes, or an average of $231 a year. The summary said set-top box rental fees have jumped 185 percent since 1994, while the cost of TVs, computers and mobile phones have dropped by 90 percent. A coalition of existing pay-TV providers oppose competition in the set-top box market and on Wednesday said it would not provide new programming to customers or lower their television bills. The FCC said consumers should be allowed to get cable, satellite or other pay-TV through an app or through devices like a smart TV or tablet instead of only a set-top box.  “The only change the FCC is proposing is to allow consumers alternative means of accessing the content they pay for,” the summary says. Wheeler compared set-top boxes to Americans being forced to rent rotary dial telephones for decades. “The FCC unlocked competition and empowered consumers with a simple but powerful rule - consumers could connect the telephones and modems of their choice to the telephone network,” Wheeler said in an op-ed.  In 2007, the FCC opened wireless networks to non-carrier-provided devices. The FCC’s goal is to allow consumers to have a user friendly interface that integrates “pay TV and streaming content on one device.” In November, a group of eight Democratic senators including presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Al Franken, Cory Booker and Ed Markey, wrote to the FCC urging opening the set-top boxes to competition. “The FCC is finally on its way to fulfilling the promise to American consumers of a competitive and robust video box market,” Markey said Wednesday, praising the “proposal to help ensure that consumers are not captive to bloated rental fees forever.” The FCC said a competitive marketplace is required by a 1996 law. Set-top boxes should be open to pay-TV rivals using formats that conform “to specifications set by an independent, open standards body,” the FCC said.

Yahoo’s core business, which includes popular services like Yahoo Mail and its news and sports sites, could attract private equity firms, media and telecom companies or firms like Softbank Group Corp (9984.T), analysts had said. Verizon’s Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said in December that the U.S. wireless carrier could look at buying Yahoo’s core business if it was a good fit. Earlier this year, Verizon bought AOL Inc in a $4.4 billion deal to push into targeted advertising and mobile video.  Verizon and Yahoo couldn’t immediately be reached for comments. Verizon’s shares were down 1.1 percent, while Yahoo’s shares were down 4 percent in afternoon trading on Monday.

Some industry watchers had expected Internet search giant  Google to be a dark horse participant in the auction. In April last year, the company launched a new U.S. wireless service that switches between Wi-Fi and cellular networks hosted through Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc’s networks. Google last participated in a 2008 FCC auction but did not buy any airwaves.  “Like all those interested in improved connectivity and equitable access, we’ll be following the upcoming spectrum auction closely. That said, we have not filed to participate,” the Google spokeswoman said. The FCC will be auctioning off valuable 600 megahertz airwaves that can travel long distances and penetrate buildings. The auction is aimed at wireless carriers and other companies that want to improve existing wireless networks or build new ones. Wireless providers such as Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T; Inc and T-Mobile and cable operator Comcast Corp have said they will take part in the auction. The FCC’s deadline for interested bidders to file applications to participate in the auction ended on Wednesday. The auction will kick off on March 29.

995,VZ,Verizon redesigns its FiOS Custom TV offering,"NEW YORK, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc , which launched its pay TV plan “FiOS Custom TV” last year to let viewers choose bundles of channels they want to watch, has redesigned the offering. The revamped Custom TV now offers a choice of one of two packages with over 100 channels and three optional genre-specific packs instead of a slim base offering of 36 channels plus numerous genre-specific add-ons. The move to expand the offering was not in response to objections from content partners but based on customer feedback, a Verizon spokesman said. The first package called “Essentials” has over 190 channels, including the big four U.S. networks Disney’s ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC. The package also includes Discovery Channel and AMC with no sports offerings. The second package “Sports & more” has over 160 channels, including ESPN and regional sports, plus non-sports channels, such as Cartoon Network. In April last year, Verizon repackaged the traditional pay-TV bundle and created a stir with some programmers by moving channels traditionally prevalent in pay-TV base packages such as ESPN, a unit of Walt Disney Co and Comcast Corp  division NBC Universal’s USA out of a base tier into optional genre-specific add-on packs such as sports and entertainment. ESPN has sued Verizon alleging a breach of contract, while Twenty-First Century Fox and NBC Universal have said that the Custom TV offering violates their contractual obligations. The offering now costs $69.99, along with FiOS Internet and digital voice services and offers three genre-specific add-on packages with movie, family and global sports channels for $6 each. The first Custom TV iteration started at $65 a month for broadband service, 36 fixed basic channels and two genre-based channel packs, from a choice of seven for $10 each. The growing popularity of online video services such as Netflix Inc has put pressure on pay TV providers to innovate. Last month, Verizon’s chief financial officer Fran Shammo declined to comment on the ESPN lawsuit on an earnings call with investors but said that customers “don’t want to have to pay for bundles that they never use.” “We will refresh (Custom TV) here in the short term to be in compliance with the contractual arrangements,” he added. Compared to pay-TV giants AT&T; Inc with its DirecTV acquisition last year and Comcast, FiOS has a small market in 12 states and Washington, D.C.

Carl Icahn, the chairman and sole shareholder of XO Holdings, which owns XO Communications, said the deal does not represent a significant annualized return on investment but was the best achievable outcome. Icahn, who started buying senior debt of XO in 2001, said he helped bring the company out of bankruptcy in 2003 and has since had to inject additional capital several times to keep it operating.

1002,VZ,CORRECTED-AT&T; says has edge in 5G due to expanded Internet access,"(Corrects paragraph 1 to say AT&T; thinks it has an advantage in 5G technology due to promises it made to expand Internet access related to its DIRECTV acquisition, instead of solely because of its DIRECTV acquisition) By Harro Ten Wolde BARCELONA, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Commitments AT&T; Inc  made to build out fixed high-speed Internet services to gain regulatory approval for its $48.5 billion purchase of DIRECTV will give it the edge over U.S. rival Verizon in the roll-out of the next generation of cellular technology, AT&T;’s strategy chief said on Monday. So-called 5G wireless networks are expected to offer 1,000-fold gains in capacity over existing networks, giving the potential to connect at least 100 billion devices with download speeds that can reach 10 gigabits per second (Gb/s). To achieve that, wireless networks will need to be supported by existing fixed-line infrastructure. So DIRECTV’s widespread fixed-line network will be a big boost for AT&T;, Chief Strategy Officer John Donovan said in an interview at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. “We are in a better position because we have a fixed line proposition which is becoming much more interesting now with 5G,” Donovan said. Verizon spokesman Jim Gerace said: “AT&T; has followed us in every turn of technology - wireless and wired - and they will again with 5G.” The global telecom industry will release official standards for 5G in 2018 but some players have begun planning test runs. AT&T; said this month it planned to have trials of 5G technology by the end of this year, while Verizon said late last year it would kick off trials in 2016. Donovan also said AT&T; would continue to oppose a proposal approved by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to let consumers swap pricey cable boxes for cheaper devices and apps. The move was aimed at boosting competition in the $20 billion television set-top box market, while delivering a blow to major cable companies. The FCC has opened up a discussion on the plan for the coming months. “We will continue to be very vocal in our opposition,” Donovan said, adding AT&T; would plea for a software oriented solution, which would mean customers could keep their set-top box, while allowing competition.

A federal judge last week ordered Apple to create new software and take other steps to retrieve data from the locked iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the San Bernardino shooters who was killed in a gun battle with police. Apple, which opposes the order, has urged the creation of a government panel on encryption. Verizon and other telecom firms benefit from sales of Apple’s iPhone and tablets. AT&T; Inc said in a statement on Wednesday that there needs to be more “legal clarity” on privacy and security issues, adding that Congress should decide on safeguards. The Justice Department has pushed back on framing the dispute as an encryption issue, insisting that it is only trying to get past the locked screen on one phone. Many technology security experts have said technical efforts to provide government access to encrypted devices, a so-called “backdoor,” inevitably degrades security for everyone. It is an argument that has been made since the 1990s, when the government tried and failed to force tech companies to incorporate a special chip into their products for surveillance purposes. Apple has argued that while it is technically possible to bypass the security features of the iPhone by building a new operating system, such a move would set a dangerous precedent.

Verizon Wireless agreed to get consumer consent before sending data about “supercookies” from its more than 100 million users, under a settlement. The largest U.S. mobile company inserted unique tracking codes in its users traffic for advertising purposes. Supercookies are unique, undeletable identifiers inserted into web traffic to identify customers in order to deliver targeted ads from Verizon and others. The FCC said Verizon Wireless failed to disclose the practice from late 2012 until 2014, violating a 2010 FCC regulation on Internet transparency. The FCC also said the supercookies overrode consumers privacy practices they had set on web browsers, which led some advocates to call it a “zombie cookie.” Under the agreement, consumers must opt in to allow their information to be shared outside Verizon Wireless, and have the right to “opt out” of sharing information with Verizon. Until March 2015, Verizon Wireless consumers could not opt out of the “supercookies,” but after several U.S. senators raised concerns about the practice, the company agreed to allow an opt-out. “Consumers care about privacy and should have a say in how their personal information is used, especially when it comes to who knows what they’re doing online,” said FCC Enforcement Bureau Chief Travis LeBlanc. Verizon spokesman Richard Young said the company “gives customers choices about how we use their data ... Over the past year, we have made several changes to our advertising programs that have provided consumers with even more options. Today’s settlement with the FCC recognizes that.” U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, said the settlement was “a win for consumers that will hopefully make companies think twice before engaging in practices that violate consumer privacy.” The FCC plans to unveil new proposed privacy protections for broadband as soon as later this month. In November, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said he expected the commission would address privacy practices “in the next several months” for companies that provide network services.

Those are two very important baseline rights that individuals ought to have.” ",3072016,http://www.reuters.com/article/verizon-fcc-settlement/update-2-verizon-wireless-to-pay-1-35-mln-fine-to-settle-u-s-privacy-probe-idUSL1N16F0YH

Verizon Wireless has agreed to get consumer consent before sending data about “supercookies” from its more than 100 million users, under a settlement approved Monday. The largest U.S. mobile firm inserted unique tracking codes in its users traffic for advertising purposes. The FCC said Verizon Wireless failed to disclose the practice from late 2012 until 2014 and said it violated a 2010 FCC regulation on internet transparency. The FCC also said the supercookies overrode consumers privacy practices they had set on web browsers, which led some advocates to call it a “zombie cookie.”   (Reporting by David Shepardson)",3072016,http://www.reuters.com/article/verizon-fcc-settlement/verizon-wireless-will-pay-1-35-million-fine-to-settle-u-s-privacy-probe-idUSL1N16F0WP

1012,VZ,New York Times' editorial page editor Andrew Rosenthal to step down,"(Reuters) - New York Times Co said on Monday Andrew Rosenthal would step down as the newspaper’s editorial page editor in late April, and would be succeeded by James Bennet, editor-in-chief of the Atlantic. Rosenthal, 60, the son of former NYT executive editor A. M. Rosenthal, joined the Times in 1987 and oversaw the newspaper’s influential opinion page. “Andy has done more than just preside over the continued excellence of our opinion pages, he has reinvented them for the digital age,” NYT publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr said. Born in India, Rosenthal served as the Associated Press’s Moscow bureau chief during the Soviet Union’s final years, before he joined NYT. Bennet, who will join the Times on May 2, previously served as Jerusalem bureau chief and White House correspondent at the newspaper before leaving in 2006 to head the Atlantic. Under Bennet’s leadership, the Atlantic brought down its paywall in 2008 and reported its first profit after at least a decade. Separately, Atlantic Media Chairman David Bradley said co-president Bob Cohn has been appointed sole president of the magazine following Bennet’s decision to leave the company. Bradley and Cohn will lead the search for a new editor in chief for the magazine, the Atlantic said.

1013,VZ,FCC Internet privacy proposal could harm broadband providers - Moody's,"(Reuters) - Ratings agency Moody’s Investors Services said on Tuesday that a proposal by U.S. communications regulators to impose privacy restrictions on broadband providers like Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T; Inc, Comcast Corp  and Charter Communications Inc was “credit-negative.” U.S. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler on Thursday proposed barring providers from collecting user data without getting consent as part of a privacy proposal for internet use. Moody’s said Internet providers could be “severely handicapped” in their ability to compete with digital advertisers such as Facebook Inc and Google. Under the FCC proposal, Google, Facebook, Twitter Inc  and other websites could keep collecting data from users without their consent, Moody’s said. “We believe this to be a long-term risk to the current TV advertising business model, as well as all broadband providers whom also have ad sales exposure,” Moody’s said. Digital advertisers like Google and Facebook are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission, under a less stringent standard than the FCC’s proposed rule. Unless the two agencies align their privacy laws, Moody’s said, online digital advertisers will have “a distinct competitive advantage” as more advertising dollars will continue to flow to them. AT&T; said last week that it was unfair that the FCC is holding broadband providers to a different standard than companies such as Apple Inc and Google. Wheeler’s plan would require broadband providers to obtain consumer consent, disclose data collection, protect personal information and report breaches. These companies currently collect consumer data without consent, and some use it for targeted advertising, which has drawn criticism from privacy advocates. The FCC has authority to set privacy rules after it reclassified broadband providers last year as part of new “net neutrality” regulations. A federal appeals court has not ruled on a court challenge to that decision. The FCC will vote on Wheeler’s proposal at its March 31 meeting. A final vote on new regulations would follow a public comment period.

1017,VZ,Blackstone makes quiet sale ahead of FCC airwaves auction,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A quiet decision by private equity firm Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) to recently sell three TV stations may foreshadow uncertain returns for some selling TV airwaves and lower wireless demand in the U.S. government’s upcoming spectrum auction, industry watchers say. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission’s auction, which kicks off on March 29, will sell low-frequency airwaves held by TV broadcasters to wireless companies and other bidders.   Blackstone-controlled investment vehicle LocusPoint Networks LLC bought at least 16 stations from San Francisco to Miami, spending $66 million since 2012, according to FCC filings and data from research firm SNL Kagan.  Other well-funded buyout firms such as OTA Broadcasting LLC backed by billionaire Michael Dell and NRJ TV LLC, funded by Fortress Investment Group, have also snatched up TV stations in the run-up to the auction. But in late November, shortly before the FCC began accepting applications from TV stations to sell spectrum, Blackstone’s LocusPoint agreed to sell three stations in Baltimore, Detroit and Buffalo, New York, for about $24 million, according to FCC filings reviewed by Reuters. The deal closed late last month. That’s five times the $4.8 million Blackstone paid, but just 5 percent of the government’s $477 million stated opening bid prices for the three stations’ spectrum licenses.  Its acceptance of the deal for $24 million implies Blackstone lowered its expectations for the auction, even as the government’s $477 million opening bid was not realistic,  analysts said. The FCC will first hold a “reverse auction,” gradually reducing its offer to the lowest amount participating TV broadcasters will accept. Wireless companies then bid for airwaves.  “There’s a general agreement among broadcasters that the opening bid prices that you see registered are high and that you won’t be getting that,” said Dr. John MacKerron, professor at Towson University who manages student-run WMJF-CD in Towson, Maryland, one of the three sold to HME. Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner forecasts the 2016 auction proceeds at $20 billion to the low $30 billion range. The FCC’s “AWS-3 auction” that ended last year saw record  bids of $44.9 billion. “If it would be a massive success, (Blackstone) wouldn’t sell right now, right before (the auction),” Enter said.  While spectrum in certain geographic areas around metropolitan areas is attractive, there is a glut in secondary markets, analysts said. Moreover, some of the biggest wireless bidders are still digesting their investments from the previous FCC auction that ended last year, they added.  Blackstone sold to HME Equity Fund II, owned by U.S. President Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign manager, Jim Messina, and retired National Basketball Association player Grant Hill, and others, according to filings.  Blackstone declined to comment and a lawyer for HME did not respond to requests for comment.  The three stations sold are among those in Blackstone’s portfolio with lowest opening bid prices. Stations that LocusPoint has retained in major markets such as San Francisco and Orlando say “cha-ching,” Entner said.  If HME is unable to sell the licenses, “they could sell (after the auction) for less than what LocusPoint paid for them,” SNL Kagan analyst Justin Nielson said. OTA and NRJ have not sold stations ahead of the auction, he added. Top U.S. wireless carriers Verizon Communications Inc(VZ.N)  and AT&T; Inc (T.N) , pay-TV providers Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and Dish Corp (DISH.O) have filed to participate, but some analysts do not expect them to bid aggressively.  T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) has said it needs low-frequency spectrum for network enhancements. Sprint Corp (S.N) will sit out.

1023,VZ,FCC advances privacy proposal for U.S. internet users,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Thursday advanced a proposal to ensure the privacy of broadband Internet users by barring providers from collecting user data without consent. The proposed regulation from FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler won initial approval with a 3-2 vote to require broadband providers to obtain consumer consent, disclose data collection, protect personal information and report breaches — but would not bar any data collection practices. “It’s the consumers’ information and the consumer should have the right to determine how it’s used,” Wheeler said. Broadband providers currently collect consumer data without consent and some use that data for targeted advertising, which has drawn criticism from privacy advocates. Wheeler’s proposal does not prohibit Internet providers from using or sharing customer data for any purpose. The FCC would not extend the broadband provider privacy rules to sites such as Twitter, Google or Facebook, drawing the ire of providers. Republican Commissioner Ajit Pai said Thursday there is no good reason to single out broadband providers for regulations, while not regulating websites. The plan “favors one set of corporate interests over another,” he said. The FCC has authority to set privacy rules after it reclassified broadband providers last year as part of new net neutrality regulations. A federal appeals court has not ruled on a challenge to that decision. A final vote on new regulations will follow a public comment period during which the FCC is asking for possible “additional or alternative paths to achieve pro-consumer, pro-privacy goals.” Under the rules providers would need to tell consumers what information is being collected, how it is being used and when it will be shared. They would also be required protect data under a data security standard. Consumers would need to be notified of breaches of their data no later than 10 days after it was discovered. Ratings agency Moody’s Investors Services said earlier the proposal to impose privacy restrictions on broadband providers such as Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T; Inc, Comcast Corp is “credit negative.” Advocacy group Free Press praised the FCC for moving ahead and said the commission must consider other issues in setting rules including “pay-for-privacy, deep-packet inspection, upselling services, competition and data security.” The National Cable and Telecommunications Association urged  the FCC to adopt a “technology neutral approach by treating companies with access to similar user information the same.” ",3312016,http://www.reuters.com/article/fcc-privacy/fcc-advances-privacy-proposal-for-u-s-internet-users-idUSL2N1731OQ

1029,VZ,US STOCKS-Wall St falls amid global growth worries,"(Reuters) - U.S. stocks dropped on Thursday as oil prices slid and worries about the global economy resurfaced, dragging down the dollar against the yen and causing investors to flee riskier assets. The S&P; 500 posted its biggest daily percentage loss in about six weeks, while the growth worries weighed especially on interest-rate sensitive financials .SPSY, strategists said. The group fell 1.9 percent and was the biggest drag on the S&P; 500. “There’s concern about a global slowdown,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.  “I think what we’re seeing is the market believes that these (global central bank) policies and discussions on negative rates have diminishing returns at this point and are creating more harm than good, more uncertainty than stability.” The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI closed down 174.09 points, or 0.98 percent, to 17,541.96, the S&P; 500 .SPX lost 24.75 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,041.91 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 72.35 points, or 1.47 percent, to 4,848.37. The dollar fell as much as 1.6 percent against the yen JPY=. Minutes from the Federal Reserve’s March meeting released on Wednesday pointed to concerns about the U.S. central bank’s limited ability to tackle a global economic slowdown. Minutes from the European Central Bank’s March policy meeting on Thursday showed that governors from around the euro zone had been told the global economic outlook had got worse. Crude oil LCOc1 CLc1 settled lower on Thursday after data showed higher weekly inventories. The S&P; energy index .SPNY was down 0.6 percent. Adding to investor caution, first-quarter earnings kick into high gear next week, with a 7.4-percent year-over-year decline projected for S&P; 500 companies, according to Thomson Reuters data. Some strategists argue the recent sharp drop in earnings forecasts could result in more positive surprises. Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) shares were down 2.8 percent at $52 after Bloomberg reported Verizon plans to make a first-round bid for Yahoo Inc’s YHOO.O web business next week. Yahoo was down 1.3 percent at $36.17. Volume was slightly above the short-term average. About 7.2 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the 7.1 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data. After the bell, shares of Gap (GPS.N) fell 9.1 percent to $25.16 following the release of its March sales results. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,349 to 677, for a 3.47-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 2,063 issues fell and 751 advanced for a 2.75-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.

The S&P; 500 posted its biggest daily percentage loss in six weeks. The growth worries weighed especially on interest-rate sensitive financials, strategists said, with the group down 1.9 percent and the biggest drag on the S&P; 500. “There’s concern about a global slowdown,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. “I think what we’re seeing is the market believes that these (global central bank) policies and discussions on negative rates have diminishing returns at this point and are creating more harm than good, more uncertainty than stability.” The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 174.09 points, or 0.98 percent, to 17,541.96, the S&P; 500 lost 24.75 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,041.91 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 72.35 points, or 1.47 percent, to 4,848.37. The dollar fell as much as 1.6 percent against the yen  to its lowest since October 2014 on expectations the Bank of Japan was unlikely to intervene with more policy measures. Minutes from the Fed’s March meeting released on Wednesday pointed to concerns about the central bank’s limited ability to tackle a global economic slowdown, reducing the odds of a rate increase before June. Crude oil settled lower on Thursday after data showed higher weekly inventories. The S&P; energy index was down 0.6 percent. Adding to investor caution, first-quarter earnings kick into high gear next week, with a 7.4-percent year-over-year decline projected for S&P; 500 companies, according to Thomson Reuters data. Some strategists argue the recent sharp drop in earnings forecasts could result in more positive surprises. Verizon Communications Inc shares were down 2.8 percent at $52 after Bloomberg reported Verizon plans to make a first-round bid for Yahoo Inc’s web business next week. Yahoo was down 1.3 percent at $36.17. Volume was slightly above the short-term average. About 7.2 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the 7.1 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

1036,VZ,"About 40,000 unionized Verizon workers walk off the job","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nearly 40,000 Verizon workers walked off the job on Wednesday in one of the largest U.S. strikes in recent years after contract talks hit an impasse, and got a boost as U.S. Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders joined them at a Brooklyn rally ahead of the New York primary next week. Front-runner Hillary Clinton, who will face Sanders in the  primary on April 19, also voiced support for the strikers and urged Verizon to go back to the bargaining table.   The strike was called by the Communications Workers of America (CWA) and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers that jointly represent employees with such jobs as customer services representatives and network technicians in Verizon Communications Inc’s (VZ.N) traditional wireline phone operations. The strike could affect service in Verizon’s Fios Internet, telephone and TV services businesses across several U.S. East Coast states, including New York, Massachusetts and Virginia. The walkout does not extend to the wireless operation. Verizon said it had trained thousands of non-union employees over the past year to ensure no disruption in services. “There’s no way that these 10,000 people ... can make up for 40,000 people who have decades of experience (in highly technical jobs),” CWA representative Bob Master said.  The wireline unit, which represents Verizon’s legacy business, generated about 29 percent of company revenue in 2015, down about 60 percent since 2000, and less than 7 percent of operating income.  Verizon has been scaling back its Fios TV and Internet service and stopped expanding its landline phone network.  In recent years, Verizon, the No. 1 U.S. wireless company, has shifted focus to the bread-and-butter wireless business and new efforts in mobile video and advertising. To that end, Verizon bought AOL for $4.4 billion last year betting that a push into mobile video and targeted advertising can help it find new growth avenues. Sanders spoke to a crowd of cheering Verizon workers at a mid-day rally in Brooklyn. “This is just another major American corporation trying to destroy the lives of working Americans,” he said.  In urging a resumption of talks, Clinton said in a statement, “We rely on these men and women as part of the communications infrastructure that keeps businesses and our economy moving.” Verizon didn’t appear to be swayed. “Big companies are an easy target for candidates looking for convenient villains for the economic distress felt by many of our citizens,” Verizon Chief Executive Officer Lowell McAdam said in a blog post. “Contrary to Sen. Sanders’ contention, our proposals do not call for mass layoffs or shipping jobs overseas,” McAdam said.  Hundreds of Verizon workers protested outside Verizon stores along the East Coast on Wednesday. In New York, strikers chanted “We’re disgusted, union busted” and held placards reading “Against Verizon’s corporate greed.”  “They even want us to move to different states and that’s unfair. How do we take care of our families?” said Anita Long, a 59 year-old telecommunications technician assistant.  “How do you make a billion dollars in one month and tell me you can’t give me a decent wage?” said Long, who has worked at Verizon for 37 years, picketing in Brooklyn.  Verizon and the unions have been talking since last June over the company’s plans to cut healthcare and pension-related benefits over a three-year period. The workers have been without a contract since its agreement expired in August. Issues include healthcare, offshoring call center jobs, temporary job relocations and pensions.

1038,VZ,Breakingviews: Verizon workers bolster unions' cautious comeback,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Verizon Communications  workers are bolstering unions’ cautious comeback. The telecom company’s staff walked out in one of the largest U.S. strikes in years after contract talks stalled. Add a Supreme Court win, minimum-wage hikes and a big role in presidential races, and organized labor’s future begins to look a bit brighter. Some 40,000 customer-services representatives, landline-phone technicians and others are picketing the company. That’s not far off the total who downed tools in 12 significant U.S. strikes last year. Verizon’s employees, who have not had a contract since August, are protesting planned cuts in healthcare and pension-related benefits over three years. Prospects for success are uncertain, of course. A 2011 Verizon strike resulted in a new contract after two weeks. The size of the current stoppage, though, suggests growing confidence among workers emboldened by recent triumphs. Last month, the Supreme Court upheld a California law allowing unions to require collective-bargaining fees from non-members in state-government jobs. Banning the practice might have crippled the finances of public unions already stung by restrictions in Wisconsin and other states. Unions have also made headway pushing for higher minimum-wage laws. Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle increased base pay to at least $15 an hour, and New York this month agreed to move toward that level in much of the state. Moreover, presidential candidates are showing labor some love. Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders joined Verizon employees on the picket line, and Hillary Clinton has been courting unions heavily. Republican hopeful Donald Trump has parlayed populist positions on trade and other economic issues into boisterous support among union employees. Organized labor has its work cut out for it, though. Membership has held steady over the past two years at about 15 million employees, or roughly 11 percent of the American workforce, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. In 1983, when data was first collected, there were almost 18 million union workers comprising more than 20 percent of the workforce. And while 35 percent of public-sector workers are union members, Wisconsin’s successful campaign against them has proven popular around the country. Unions may have much to celebrate. There is, however, a lot of ground to make up. - Some 40,000 Verizon Communications workers on April 13 walked off the job because of disagreements about planned cuts in healthcare and pension-related benefits over the next three years. - The strike called by the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers involves customer-services representatives, network technicians in landline-telephone operations and employees in similar jobs.

1042,VZ,"Verizon servicing current customers, delays new installations in strike","NEW YORK (Reuters) - A one-day-old strike by nearly 40,000 Verizon Communications Inc employees is causing equipment installation delays for new Internet and TV customers, a Verizon executive acknowledged on Thursday. Workers of Verizon’s Fios Internet, telephone and TV services from network technicians to customer service representatives walked off the job on Wednesday in one of the largest U.S. strikes in recent years after contract talks between unions representing them and the company hit an impasse. The company, which is focusing on repairs and service for its existing customers, said networks were running well. “We do have a bit of a delay,” said Tami Erwin, Verizon’s Group President - Consumer and Mass Business Sales and Service, said. “We’re working hard with customers to prioritize repair above activations and provisioning because we owe that to our existing customers.” In a week or two the company should be able to do new installations, she said. It normally has about 30,000 to 35,000 of them each week, with over 30 percent of customers opting to do a self-installation. The strike affects service across several U.S. East Coast states, including New York, Massachusetts and Virginia, but does not extend to the company’s wireless operation. Union representatives and Verizon said on Thursday no talks were scheduled so far. Verizon has said it had trained thousands of non-union employees over the past year to ensure no disruption in services. The unions, however, say that replacement workers do not have the necessary expertise, especially in highly technical jobs such as equipment installations. The company has deployed about 20,000 non-union workers to fill in for union workers, said Bob Mudge, president of Verizon’s wireline network operations. “We’ll continue to ramp from that,” Mudge added. “We’re going to work seven days a week.” Verizon and the unions have been in contract talks since last June; the sticking points include healthcare, temporary job relocations, pensions and offshoring call center jobs. A day after the strike started, there were a handful of customer complaints on Verizon’s customer service website related to Internet outages and a no-show after a scheduled installation appointment.",4142016,http://www.reuters.com/article/verizon-strike/verizon-servicing-current-customers-delays-new-installations-in-strike-idUSL2N17H2LH

1047,VZ,Obama urges agency to open competition in cable TV boxes,"WASHINGTON, April 15 (Reuters) - The Obama administration on Friday weighed into the debate over allowing consumers to switch pricey cable television boxes for less expensive devices, urging an agency to set an example for other parts of government to boost competition. Consumers can spend nearly $1,000 over four years for renting cable set top boxes. Opening the business to competition and allowing consumers to chose devices or apps they can own could mean quick savings, an official said. “You could have a set a standards such that anyone could connect any box to their cable and those boxes could compete for lower prices and greater innovation,” Jason Furman, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers told reporters in a teleconference. The Federal Communications Commission, an independent agency, in February proposed a rule opening competition in the $20 billion television set-top box market. It set a 60 day comment period on the rule that could cost major cable companies. The rule would allow consumers to obtain video services from providers such as Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc and Tivo, instead of cable, satellite and other television providers such Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications . It is unclear if the rule will be implemented before Obama leaves office next January. Cable and television companies have lashed out against the proposal saying it could stifle innovation. The administration entered the debate through a rare filing into the FCC’s comment period. “When the President personally gets involved is when it’s of real great importance, in his mind, to consumers, to competition, and to the economy more broadly,” Furman said. Obama will also sign an executive order on Friday calling on federal agencies and departments to report in 60 days on specific areas where additional measures can be taken to open competition. Furman would not venture a guess on what kind of pro competition measures that order could spur. The administration is looking to add to actions it has already taken for consumers on cell phones, net neutrality and retirement advice. “This is going to be a whole of government effort to empower consumers, workers and small businesses,” Furman said.

If the strike, now in its second week, continues for an extended period of time, it could pressure full-year earnings, Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said in an interview.  “We’d like to settle this sooner than later,” Shammo said. About 40,000 employees of Verizon’s wireline business, which includes its Fios Internet, telephone and TV services, went on strike after reaching an impasse in talks over a new labor contract. Issues include healthcare, offshoring of call center jobs, temporary job relocations and pensions. In the wireline business, consumer revenue of $4 billion was little changed from a year ago.  Net income attributable to the company rose to $4.31 billion, or $1.06 per share, in the first quarter, meeting analysts’ expectations.    The company stood by its full-year profit forecast.  Verizon has been scaling back its Fios TV and Internet business, which represented about 29 percent of its 2015 revenue.  “Rather than investing in good jobs here at home, Verizon refuses to make Fios available to thousands of people ... throughout the East Coast and is embarking on a questionable path to acquire troubled Yahoo and other companies,” Brooklyn-based Verizon field technician Anthony Finocchio, said in a statement on Thursday.    To tap new revenue, the company has shifted its focus to the advertising-supported Internet business and acquired AOL last June for $4.4 billion. It is seen as the front-runner in bidding for Yahoo Inc’s core Internet business. The company, known for its high-quality network, is locked in a battle for subscribers with competitors in the saturated U.S. wireless market. Smaller rival Sprint Corp has been offering half-off discounts, and T-Mobile US Inc has launched free music and video-streaming plans. Verizon reported strong subscriber net additions for the first quarter ended March 31, adding 640,000 wireless retail postpaid subscribers, helped by tablet promotions during a seasonally slow period for phone upgrades. That surpassed analysts’ average estimate of 480,000, according to market research firm FactSet StreetAccount. Customer defections, or churn, in Verizon’s wireless postpaid business, dropped to 0.96 percent from 1.03 percent a year earlier. Total operating revenue rose 0.6 percent to $32.17 billion, falling slightly short of analysts’ average estimate of $32.46 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

1050,VZ,US STOCKS-Wall Street cedes ground after mixed bag of earnings,"(Add detail on after hours action) * Travelers biggest drag on Dow after results * Verizon drops as striking workers hit profits * Alphabet, Microsoft, Starbucks, Visa down after the bell * Indexes down: Dow 0.63 pct, S&P; 0.52 pct, Nasdaq 0.05 pct By Noel Randewich April 21 (Reuters) - Wall Street suffered its first loss in four sessions on Thursday after a mixed bag of quarterly reports and a warning by Verizon Communications that a strike by workers would likely impact its bottom line. The benchmark S&P; 500 index in recent days had rallied to within 1 percent of its May record high, buoyed by a softer dollar and recovering crude prices. But investors had little patience for quarterly scorecards failing to meet already toned-down expectations. “Earnings have been decent, outperforming, but outperforming expectations that have been dramatically lowered,” said Charlie Johnson, a sales trader at Greentree Brokerage Services in Philadelphia. “So it’s like a shell game.” Crude fell about 1 percent, but hovered near five-month highs after the International Energy Agency said 2016 would see the biggest fall in non-OPEC production in 25 years. Oil and U.S. stock prices have been moving in lockstep for several months. Verizon’s shares dropped 3.32 percent after the telecom said a strike by its wireline workers would likely hurt earnings this quarter. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 0.63 percent to end at 17,982.52 points and the S&P; 500 lost 0.52 percent to 2,091.48. The Nasdaq Composite edged down 0.05 percent to 4,945.89. Nine of the 10 major S&P; sectors fell, with the telecom sector down 2.74 percent, thanks largely to Verizon. After the bell, Google parent-company Alphabet, Microsoft, Visa and Starbucks all posted disappointing quarterly reports, sending their stocks down more than 4 percent. During the session, Travelers fell 6.05 percent after the property and casualty insurer reported a 17 percent fall in profit. The stock was the biggest drag on the Dow. Of the S&P; companies that have reported so far for the first quarter, 77 percent have beaten profit estimates, compared with the 63 percent that surprise in a typical quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. S&P; 500 companies are expected to post a 7.2 percent fall in profit on average, and then a less drastic 2.6 percent dip in the second quarter. “We think the market has already discounted the weak first quarter and possibly even some negative earnings in the second quarter,” said Paul Christopher, head global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “If the second quarter were as disappointing as the first quarter, you’d see another downturn.” American Express shares climbed 0.91 percent after revenue rose for the first time in five quarters, while Mattel  sank 5.78 percent after sales fell. Under Armour rose 6.78 percent, while General Motors  added 1.46 percent after both reported better-than-expected profits. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,897 to 1,095. On the Nasdaq, 1,493 issues fell and 1,311 rose. The S&P; 500 index showed 10 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 47 new highs and 19 lows. About 7.3 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 6.8 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

1056,VZ,"Verizon, striking unions at impasse as health benefits to expire","NEW YORK (Reuters) - A strike by nearly 40,000 Verizon Communications Inc workers is in its third week with unions and the company still far apart on contract talks, even as employee healthcare benefits are set to expire on Saturday. Workers, from network technicians to customer service representatives, in Verizon’s Fios Internet, telephone and TV services walked off the job on April 13 in one of the largest U.S. strikes in recent years after contract talks hit an impasse. A resolution on various issues, including temporary job relocations, pensions and moving call center jobs offshore, has yet to be reached, representatives of Verizon and the Communications Workers of America union said on Wednesday. Verizon, which said last week that a long-drawn labor dispute would pressure its earnings, remains committed to reaching a fair deal, spokesman Rich Young said in a phone interview. A meeting between Verizon and union representatives is scheduled for Thursday afternoon, he said. Verizon has notified striking workers that under federal law their health care coverage was set to expire on April 30, Young said. Verizon has said it spent over $3.2 billion on healthcare for employees last year. The company offers insurance coverage to those employees who are actively working, Young said. Striking employees have the option of seeking coverage under the U.S government’s Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) health insurance plan to get temporary healthcare coverage. “They think that this is going to be used as a wedge to break this strike. I assure you it will not,” said Ed Mooney, vice president of CWA District 2-13, said in a phone interview. The CWA also has funds, collected through contributions from affiliated union members and other donors, to help cover healthcare costs of members when needed, Mooney said. “It’s horrible. Most of us are parents, I have a daughter and the prospect of losing our children’s healthcare is actually quite disturbing,” Fitz Boyce, 45, a field technician at Verizon for over two decades, said in an interview at the picket line in front of the company’s Times Square store in New York. The strike affects Fios Internet, telephone and TV services across several U.S. East Coast states, including New York and  Virginia. Verizon has trained thousands of non-union employees over the past year to ensure no service disruption. The company has fielded over 60,000 requests since the strike began, Young said. The unions have said that replacement workers do not have the necessary expertise, especially in highly technical jobs such as equipment installations.

1060,VZ,Strike-hit Verizon makes 'final' contract proposal to unions,"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc said it had presented a revised and “final” contract proposal to unions representing nearly 40,000 striking workers, who walked off their jobs in mid-April after talks over a new labor agreement hit an impasse.  The company on Thursday said it was now offering a wage increase of 7.5 percent over the term of a new contract, up from its previous offer of a 6.5 percent raise. “We are putting our last, best final offer on the table,” Verizon’s Chief Administrative Officer Marc Reed said in a statement. “The ball is now in the unions’ court to do what’s right for our employees.” Verizon ‘s proposal comes ahead of the expiration on Saturday of healthcare coverage for striking employees. Workers from network technicians to customer service representatives in Verizon’s Fios Internet, telephone and TV services across several U.S. Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states, including New York and Virginia, walked off the job on April 13 in one of the largest U.S. strikes in recent years. The strike was called by the Communications Workers of America (CWA) and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Sticking points in contract negotiations include job relocations, pensions, healthcare coverage and the offshoring of call center jobs. In its proposal, Verizon said it will continue to match retirement saving contributions and offer pensions with increases over three years. It also laid out job security and buyout terms and some healthcare costs it wants employees to bear beyond the company’s coverage. At meetings on Thursday, “executives refused to back off of callous proposals that would hurt working families and destroy middle class jobs,” the CWA said in a statement. “The company also failed to budge on the issues facing Verizon Wireless workers.” The union said it was considering how to move forward.      Verizon, the No. 1 U.S. wireless company, has shifted its focus in recent years to new efforts in mobile video and advertising, while scaling back its Fios TV and Internet service. It has stopped expanding its old landline phone network and the wireline unit generated about 29 percent of company revenue in 2015, down about 60 percent since 2000. The company has said it has trained thousands of non-union employees over the past year to ensure no service disruption. If the strike continues for an extended period, it could impact 2016 earnings, Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo has said. More than a thousand union workers have returned to work since the strike began and more are expected to follow, the company said in a statement.

1066,VZ,Striking union workers protest at Verizon shareholder meeting,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Dozens of Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) landline workers, on strike since mid-April after contract talks hit an impasse, marched on the company’s annual shareholder meeting in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on Thursday. The unions said about 15 protesters blocked traffic after they laid down atop a large banner on the street. The Albuquerque Police Department said no arrests were made but 15 people were cited. More than 250 protesters, including workers and supporters, demonstrated at the meeting, where the agenda included an election for 13 directors and a vote on executive compensation. The unions for the strikers said they also planned hundreds of protests across the United States against Verizon, the No. 1 U.S. wireless service provider. Nearly 40,000 network technicians and customer service representatives of the company’s Fios Internet, telephone and television services units walked off the job on April 13. The action was called by the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. The strike is in its fourth week. Sticking points include offshore call-center jobs, job relocations and healthcare coverage. The striking workers have about $1.3 billion in Verizon stock holdings, according to the unions.  They voted on proposals including one brought by the Association of BellTel Retirees that seeks the company to require shareholder approval for any executive severance agreement offering a payout of more than triple the base salary. Verizon shareholders rejected this proposal on Thursday,  according to Don Dunn,a union representative and Long Island, New York-based Fios field technician, who attended the meeting.  Verizon said last week it had presented an updated and “final” offer to the unions, including a wage increase of 7.5 percent. The company, which has been scaling back its Fios and legacy landline business, wants workers to shoulder more healthcare costs and be open to relocating to new job locations.  The union rejected the new proposal and the parties remain far apart. “CWA is the one of the biggest unions out there and if we lose this fight, all other unions...they are going to lose. There’s a lot at stake here,” said Shon Scents, a Verizon cable splicer, at the protest in New York’s Financial District on Thursday. The work stoppage at Verizon stretched across several U.S. East Coast states, including New York, Massachusetts and Virginia. Verizon has said it has brought in thousands of temporary workers to avoid service disruptions.  The workers have been without a contract since August.

1070,VZ,"UPDATE 1-Verizon, ESPN reach settlement in Fios pay-TV lawsuit","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc said on Tuesday it has reached a settlement with ESPN in a lawsuit over the slimmed-down Verizon-Fios pay-TV offering that had left the sports channel out of the basic package. The terms of the settlement will not be disclosed, the companies said in a statement. Walt Disney Co’s ESPN sued Verizon in April last year for breach of contract after the telecom company launched its Fios Custom TV plan, a small bundle of 36 channels plus numerous genre-specific add-ons. With Custom TV, Verizon created a stir with some programmers by moving some traditional pay TV base-tier channels into optional genre-specific add-on packs. The channels it moved included ESPN, a unit of Walt Disney Co and Comcast Corp division NBC Universal’s USA. In February, Verizon redesigned Custom TV to offer two packages with over 100 channels, with one that included ESPN in the base tier. ESPN had said in response that is was encouraged by the change and both companies put a hold on the legal dispute to try to settle the issue out of court.

1079,VZ,Verizon CEO says strike may impact second-quarter results,"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) Chief Executive Officer Lowell McAdam said on Tuesday the ongoing strike by the No.1 U.S. wireless provider’s nearly 40,000 union employees could pressure second-quarter results. Network technicians and customer service representatives in the company’s Fios Internet, telephone and television services units walked off the job on April 13 in one of the largest U.S. strikes in recent years. The action was called by the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. The wireless and broadband provider has “pushed off” new Fios service installations as a result of the strike, McAdam said at the J.P Morgan Technology, Media and Telecom conference in Boston. “We’re doing a lot of installations but we’re not doing the same volume that we had before,” Lowell said. “So we won’t be driving similar numbers in second quarter that we would in first from an installation perspective.” Union members protested outside the conference venue on Tuesday. The company has brought in managers and thousands of temporary workers aiming to avoid service disruptions. Verizon’s Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo, speaking at another conference last week, said the company has been focusing on repair and maintenance issues and that new installations and orders had “significantly dropped.”  “I would be optimistic if I said we would be net positive for broadband and TV this quarter,” Shammo said. Verizon is expected to report second-quarter results on July 26. In April, it reported first-quarter earnings and said the strike was expected to hurt second-quarter earnings. The company’s legacy wireline business, which includes Fios, generated about 29 percent of company revenue in 2015, down about 60 percent since 2000, and less than 7 percent of operating income.  If the strike continues for an extended period of time, it could pressure full-year earnings, Shammo told Reuters in April. Verizon Communications and representatives from the two striking unions are in contract discussions with the help of the U.S. Department of Labor. Sticking points in the talks include job relocations, offshoring call-center jobs, pensions and healthcare coverage. The groups will not make any public statements during these talks, the Labor department said last week. “When it’s done we will make sure to communicate with our investors about what the overall net-net impacts are,” McAdam said at the J.P Morgan conference.

1081,VZ,Verizon and unions reach tentative deal to end strike,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and unions representing nearly 40,000 wireline workers have reached a tentative deal “in principle” to end a strike that started April 13th, U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez said on Friday. Shares in Verizon, the No. 1 U.S. wireless company, jumped as much as 1.2 percent after the announcement and in afternoon trading were up almost 1 percent at $50.61. Workers that included network technicians and customer service representatives in the company’s Fios Internet, telephone and television services walked off the job after contract talks hit an impasse. The action was called by the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. The parties are drafting an agreement that will be submitted to the unions for ratification and workers are expected to be back on the job next week, Perez said in a statement. Terms of the agreement have not been disclosed. Sticking points in the contract negotiations had included job relocations, offshoring call-center jobs, pensions and healthcare coverage. The tentative deal ends the potentially costly and sometime-contentious 44-day strike. The workers had been without a contract since their agreement expired in August and had been without healthcare coverage since May 1.  The last contract negotiations in 2011 also led to a strike that ended after two weeks as contract talks continued. Union workers interviewed on Friday said they were relieved by the news of the tentative pact, but still remain wary as the deal terms are undisclosed.   “(The strike’s) been a burden on my family and myself,” said Fitz Boyce, 45, a Verizon field technician, who has been protesting outside Verizon’s Times Square store in New York since the strike started.  Verizon has agreed “to add good union jobs on the East Coast,” the CWA said in a statement.  The agreement is consistent with Verizon’s “objective of creating high quality American jobs,” the company said in a statement. Verizon and union representatives had been in contract discussions mediated by the U.S. Department of Labor, after Perez, in mid-May, brought both parties back to the negotiating table. The work stoppage at Verizon stretched across several U.S. East Coast states, including New York and Massachusetts. Verizon said it had trained managers and thousands of non-union employees over the past year to ensure that service would not be  disrupted.

1091,VZ,"Verizon, unions agree to pay raises, new jobs to end strike","(Reuters) - A tentative deal between Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and leaders of striking unions includes 1,400 new jobs and pay raises topping 10 percent, the company and unions representing about 40,000 workers said on Monday, hoping to end a walkout that has lasted nearly seven weeks. One analyst called the deal “very rich” for workers at Verizon, the No. 1 U.S. wireless provider, which reached the tentative pact with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) on Friday. Details for the new four-year contract were disclosed on Monday. The CWA said Verizon agreed to provide a 10.9 percent raise over four years while Verizon put the increase at 10.5 percent. According to the CWA, both numbers are correct, with the union’s calculation including compounded interest as subsequent raises are determined from a new base salary. “They needed to end the strike and they bit the bullet,” said Roger Entner of Recon Analytics. He said he thinks the deal “reinforced their commitment to basically exiting” wireline, which he called “the least profitable, most problematic part of the business” The new contract “gives Verizon four years basically to get rid of the unit. Let it be somebody else’s problem,” Entner said.  But not all analysts saw the deal as the first steps in an eventual sale of the wireline business.  “That is an option available for Verizon,” said Jim Patterson, CEO of Patterson Advisory Group. “However, their recent investment in XO (fiber-optic business) would seem to indicate that infrastructure is becoming a more vital part of the business.”  Nearly 40,000 network technicians and customer service representatives of the company’s Fios internet, telephone and television services units walked off the job on April 13.  Striking workers will be back on the job on Wednesday, the CWA said.  Joshua B. Freeman, labor historian and CUNY professor at Queens College in New York said he would call the contract a win for the union, while noting the increasing rarity of a strike of that size and length.  “These guys not only struck and survived but actually came out of it with a pretty good contract,” he said. “These days, that is a very unusual thing, to see that kind of walkout.”   The workers have been without a contract since the agreement expired in August; healthcare coverage ran out at the end of April. In 2011, Verizon workers went on strike for two weeks after negotiations deadlocked. The latest work stoppage stretched across states including New York, Massachusetts and Virginia.

1092,VZ,"UPDATE 7-Verizon, unions agree to pay raises, new jobs to end strike","(Reuters) - A tentative deal between Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and leaders of striking unions includes 1,400 new jobs and pay raises topping 10 percent, the company and unions representing about 40,000 workers said on Monday, hoping to end a walkout that has lasted nearly seven weeks. One analyst called the deal “very rich” for workers at Verizon, the No. 1 U.S. wireless provider, which reached the tentative pact with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) on Friday. Details for the new four-year contract were disclosed on Monday. The CWA said Verizon agreed to provide a 10.9 percent raise over four years while Verizon put the increase at 10.5 percent. According to the CWA, both numbers are correct, with the union’s calculation including compounded interest as subsequent raises are determined from a new base salary. “They needed to end the strike and they bit the bullet,” said Roger Entner of Recon Analytics. He said he thinks the deal “reinforced their commitment to basically exiting” wireline, which he called “the least profitable, most problematic part of the business” The new contract “gives Verizon four years basically to get rid of the unit. Let it be somebody else’s problem,” Entner said.  But not all analysts saw the deal as the first steps in an eventual sale of the wireline business.  “That is an option available for Verizon,” said Jim Patterson, CEO of Patterson Advisory Group. “However, their recent investment in XO (fiber-optic business) would seem to indicate that infrastructure is becoming a more vital part of the business.”  Nearly 40,000 network technicians and customer service representatives of the company’s Fios internet, telephone and television services units walked off the job on April 13.  Striking workers will be back on the job on Wednesday, the CWA said.  Joshua B. Freeman, labor historian and CUNY professor at Queens College in New York said he would call the contract a win for the union, while noting the increasing rarity of a strike of that size and length.  “These guys not only struck and survived but actually came out of it with a pretty good contract,” he said. “These days, that is a very unusual thing, to see that kind of walkout.”   The workers have been without a contract since the agreement expired in August; healthcare coverage ran out at the end of April. In 2011, Verizon workers went on strike for two weeks after negotiations deadlocked. The latest work stoppage stretched across states including New York, Massachusetts and Virginia. Verizon brought in thousands of temporary workers.  New York-based Verizon will add 1,300 call center jobs on the East Coast, and 100 new network technician jobs, Verizon spokesman Richard Young said.

1094,VZ,WRAPUP 6-Weak U.S. employment report dims prospect of Fed rate hike,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy created the fewest number of jobs in more than 5-1/2-years in May as manufacturing and construction employment fell sharply, which could make it harder for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. Nonfarm payrolls increased by only 38,000 jobs last month, the smallest gain since September 2010, the Labor Department said on Friday. Employment gains were also restrained by a month-long strike by Verizon (VZ.N) workers, which depressed information sector payrolls by 34,000 jobs. Underscoring the report’s weakness, employers hired 59,000 fewer workers in March and April than previously reported. While the unemployment rate fell three-tenths of a percentage point to 4.7 percent in May, the lowest level since November 2007, that was because 458,000 Americans gave up the search for work. “This is not a good report, and it may well give Fed officials second thoughts about increasing interest rates again this month or next, as some have suggested lately,” said Peter Ireland, an economics professor at Boston College. The Fed has signaled its intention to raise rates soon if job gains continue and economic data remain consistent with a pickup in growth in the second quarter.  Fed Chair Yellen said last week that a rate increase would probably be appropriate in the “coming months,” if those conditions were met. The U.S. central bank hiked its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade. The dollar .DXY tumbled against a basket of currencies on Friday and was on track for its largest one-day percentage loss in four months. U.S. stocks also fell, while prices for U.S. Treasuries rose. Financial markets largely priced out a rate increase at the Fed’s June 14-15 policy meeting after Friday’s data, according to CME Group’s FedWatch program. The chance of an increase in July fell to 37 percent from about 59 percent late on Thursday. Economists had forecast payrolls rising by 164,000 in May and the unemployment rate falling to 4.9 percent. The weak report bucks data on consumer spending, industrial production and housing that have indicated the economy was gaining momentum after growth slowed to a 0.8 percent annualized rate in the first quarter. In separate reports on Friday, the Commerce Department said goods exports rebounded strongly in April and orders for manufactured goods recorded their biggest gain in six months. A survey by the Institute for Supply Management, however, showed a significant cooling in services sector activity in May. Some economists said the sharp slowdown in employment last month was payback after unseasonably warm weather boosted hiring in February and March. They also viewed the weak payroll growth as a delayed response to tepid economic growth in the previous two quarters. “The simplest explanation is that job growth tends to respond with a lag to GDP growth, and GDP growth was rather weak around the turn of the year. This would suggest job growth should recover along with overall growth in economic activity,” said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. Despite the poor performance in May, job creation has averaged 150,000 a month this year. That is well above the 100,000 monthly employment increase that Yellen has said is needed to keep up with growth in the work-age population. Last month, the goods producing sector, which includes mining, manufacturing and construction, shed 36,000 jobs, the most since February 2010. Even excluding the Verizon strike, payrolls would have only increased by just over 70,000.  The Verizon workers, who were considered unemployed because they did not receive a salary during the payrolls survey week, returned to their jobs on Wednesday. They are expected to boost June employment. Other details of the employment report were not encouraging. Average hourly earnings rose five cents, or 0.2 percent. That was a slide from April’s 0.4 percent increase and left the year-on-year rise at 2.5 percent.  A broad measure of unemployment that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment held steady at 9.7 percent. The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, fell 0.2 percentage point to 62.6 percent. That drop unwound about two-thirds of the rise seen between last September and March of this year.  The weakness in the May employment data was broad-based. The private sector added only 25,000 jobs, the smallest number since February 2010. Manufacturing employment fell by 10,000 jobs and construction payrolls dropped by 15,000, the most since December 2013. Mining employment maintained its downward trend, shedding 10,000 positions. Mining payrolls have dropped by 207,000 since peaking in September 2014, with three-quarters of the losses in support activities. Retail payrolls rose 11,400 after losing jobs in April for the first time since December 2014. Wholesale trade employment fell by 10,300 jobs. Temporary-help jobs, a harbinger for future hiring, dropped by 21,000. There were declines in utilities and transportation and warehousing employment. Government payrolls increased by 13,000 and healthcare jobs jumped by 55,400.

1095,VZ,WRAPUP 1-U.S. job gains in May likely dented by Verizon strike,"* Nonfarm payrolls forecast to rise by 164,000 in May * Unemployment rate seen falling to 4.9 percent * Average hourly earnings expected to increase 0.2 percent * Verizon strike seen cutting 35,100 jobs from payrolls By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON, June 3 (Reuters) - A strike by Verizon  workers likely crimped U.S. job gains in May, but employment growth should still be strong enough to confirm a tightening labor market and push the Federal Reserve closer to raising interest rates soon. Nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 164,000 jobs in May after rising by 160,000 in April, according to a Reuters survey of economists ahead of Friday’s closely watched employment report. The jobless rate is forecast slipping one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.9 percent. A government report last week suggested a month-long strike by Verizon workers could slice 35,100 jobs from payrolls in May. The striking workers, who returned to their jobs on Wednesday, were regarded as unemployed because they did not receive a salary during the payrolls survey week. Without the strike, employment would probably have risen by about 200,000 jobs, matching the monthly average for the first quarter. Economists and Fed Chair Janet Yellen say monthly gains of roughly 100,000 jobs are needed to keep up with growth in the work-age population. The Labor Department is scheduled to release the jobs data at 8:30 a.m. EDT (1230 GMT). It will likely confirm the economy has bounced back after growth almost stalled at the start of the year. “As long as the report is essentially in line with April or better, we think it will support the Fed’s outlook for a 25-basis-point rate hike in June or July,” said Terry Sheehan, a senior analyst at Stone & McCarthy in Princeton, New Jersey. The U.S. central bank has signaled its intention to raise rates soon if job gains continue and economic data remain consistent with a pickup in growth in the second quarter. Yellen said last week that a rate increase would probably be appropriate in the “coming months,” if those conditions were met. Data on consumer spending, industrial production, goods exports and housing have suggested the economy is gathering speed after growth slowed to a 0.8 percent annualized rate in the first quarter. Financial markets see a small chance of a rate increase at the Fed’s June 14-15 policy meeting, but are pricing in a roughly 59 percent probability at the July gathering, according to CME Group’s FedWatch program. The Fed hiked its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade. Despite a tightening labor market, there is still no sign of meaningful wage growth. Average hourly earnings are forecast rising 0.2 percent in May after gaining 0.3 percent in April. That would keep the year-on-year rise at 2.5 percent. “There is more shadow slack given the absence of a noticeable acceleration in wage growth,” said Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moody’s Analytics in Westchester, Pennsylvania. Economists say wage growth of between 3.0 percent and 3.5 percent is needed to lift inflation to the Fed’s 2.0 percent target. There are, however, signs that inflation is creeping higher as the dampening effects of the dollar’s past rally and the oil price plunge dissipate. Other measures of labor market slack, including the number of Americans working part-time for economic reasons, will be watched for clues on how soon the job market will hit full employment. A broad measure of unemployment that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment is currently at an eight-year low. Job gains in May were likely broad-based, although mining employment probably maintained its downward trend. Mining payrolls have dropped by 191,000 since peaking in September 2014, with three-quarters of the losses in support activities. Manufacturing employment is expected to have slipped by 1,000 jobs after increasing by 4,000 in April. The Verizon labor dispute probably reduced information sector jobs by 35,100. Retail payrolls likely rebounded after shedding jobs in April for the first time since December 2014. An improvement is also expected in temporary help jobs, which have weakened since January.

The remarks were the first Verizon has made to quantify the strike’s cost. Nearly 40,000 network technicians and customer service representatives of the company’s Fios internet, telephone and television services units walked out on April 13 after contract talks hit an impasse.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch (structuring), Barclays and MUFG have been hired as lead managers on the inaugural transaction, which is expected to be $1.169 billion in size and rated Triple A. An investor roadshow will take place this week and next. The deal will be backed by Verizon cellphone payment contracts, which in the past few years have become an increasingly popular way to finance smart phone purchases. Fitch Ratings and S&P; Global Ratings were hired to rate the transaction.   ",6282016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bonds-verizon/verizon-hires-banks-for-debut-cell-phone-abs-idUSKCN0ZE1ZY
1109,VZ,"Verizon raises wireless plan rates, offers more data","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), the No. 1 U.S. wireless provider, said on Wednesday that it would increase plan rates but expand data buckets by 30 percent for its customers, who increasingly stream content through mobile devices. Starting July 7, the company will roll out a revamped version of its My Verizon mobile app to let customers control data overages and billing, as well as manage plans, it said. Moreover, emulating moves by some of its rivals such as AT&T; Inc (T.N) and T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O), it will let customers carry unused data over to the next month and begin offering users on certain plans unlimited text and calling to and from Mexico and Canada. The redesigned plans and app come as the company, known for its high-quality network, is locked in a battle for subscribers with competitors in the saturated U.S. wireless market.  Smaller rival Sprint Corp (S.N) has been offering half-off discounts, and T-Mobile has launched free music, video-streaming plans and other customer-friendly offers and free gifts to attract customers away from competitors to their networks. The new rate plans are meant to help customers tackle data overage costs and “reflect the significant growth in individual data use,” Rob Miller, vice president of consumer pricing at Verizon said in a webcast on Wednesday. Verizon is hiking rates and increasing data across all its plans. For instance, the basic “S” plan will cost $35, a $5 rise, and offer double the data at 2 gigabytes and the high-end “XXL” plan will cost $10 more at $110 and offer 24 gigabytes as opposed to the previous 16 gigabyte limit. The company also said it will introduce a “safety mode” that protects customers from data overages by slowing down their speeds. The feature is free for those on the “XL” and “XXL” plans and costs $5 for those on the “S”, “M”, “L” plans, it said. To tap new revenue beyond its bread-and-butter wireless business, the company has shifted its focus to the advertising-supported Internet business and acquired AOL last June for $4.4 billion. It is seen as the front-runner in bidding for Yahoo Inc’s YHOO.O core Internet business. Verizon shares were relatively unchanged at $55.93 in afternoon trading.

Whittemore was most recently co-head of Americas M&A; at Deutsche Bank. Reuters first reported that he had resigned from the German bank in April after about eight years.  Whittemore joined Deutsche Bank from Citigroup, where he advised telecommunications companies. As a banker, Whittemore has worked with clients such as Charlie Ergen’s EchoStar Corp and Dish Network Corp  and has also advised on large telecommunications mergers such as the formation of Verizon Communications. “The technology, media and telecommunications (TMT) sector is seeing marked evolution and Tony’s experience will add great value to our clients who rely on us for strategic advice and intellectual capital,” Gary Posternack, Barclays’ Global Head of M&A; said in the memo. Barclays has made key hires in recent months. Carlo Calabria joined as chairman of M&A; in Europe, the Middle East and Africa while two managing directors in healthcare, Jason Haas and Evan Matlin, and consumer retail investment banker Eric Biddle were also hired. Barclays is currently 4th in the Thomson Reuters U.S. M&A; league tables, up from 9th a year ago.

1118,VZ,RPT-Silicon Valley's Yahoo diaspora mourns company's decline,"SAN FRANCISCO July 21 (Reuters) - Former Yahoo executive Dan Rosensweig has not worked at the pioneering internet company in nearly a decade. But last week, as Yahoo Inc prepared to sell its core internet business, he was sporting a Yahoo T-shirt and, in an interview, reveled in memories of the company’s heyday, along with the deep impact its alumni had - and still have - in shaping Silicon Valley. He recalled a workforce that believed “they were doing something that mattered: bringing people information,” said Rosensweig, the company’s chief operating officer from 2002 until 2007. “I hire as many ex-Yahoos as I can, because I know their commitment, their talent.” Rosensweig - now CEO of the online education company Chegg Inc - is one of scores of executives around Silicon Valley who still “bleed purple,” as many Yahoo alums put it, despite the company’s more recent instability and decline. In the formative years of the web, Yahoo was the biggest, richest internet upstart in Silicon Valley, and it incubated a generation of executives. Now, as a sale and possible dismemberment of the company looms, a wave of sorrow and nostalgia is reverberating through the Yahoo diaspora. “People are sad,” said Change.org President Jennifer Dulski, who left Yahoo in 2007 after nearly a decade. “Until it really is over, a lot of us believe there will be a chance for resurgence.” She compared the emotions surrounding the auction to “when your parents sell your childhood home.” Launched in 1994 by two Stanford graduate students, Jerry Yang and David Filo, Yahoo in its early years was the destination of choice for many making their first forays into the world wide web. The company soared, and then crashed in the first dot-com bubble - and then emerged from the rubble as one of the few internet companies with substantial revenues and profits. The peak came in the mid-2000s, many former executives say, with advertisers desperate for a presence in the new online medium filling the company’s coffers. But even then, Google  was busily undermining Yahoo’s core business - helping people find things on the internet. By 2008, Yahoo was fending off a contentious takeover bid from Microsoft Corp and struggling to define its mission. That core question was never really answered, leading to years of management instability and shifting priorities. Google, Facebook Inc, Amazon.com Inc and a host of new companies, meanwhile, claimed much of the territory that might have been Yahoo’s. The auction of the company’s core assets - which has drawn bids from Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T; Inc and others and is expected to conclude by the end of the month - is likely to value them at about a hundredth of what Google-parent Alphabet Inc is worth. The auction does not include Yahoo’s valuable stakes in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, the Chinese e-commerce juggernaut, and Yahoo Japan Corp. Some of the 23 former Yahoo executives interviewed by Reuters carry other emotions, including frustration with all the missed opportunities, and anger over the management dysfunction that has plagued the company for a decade. Still, many former employees remember the Yahoo of a certain era as a special place, pointing to a youthful energy, a culture of learning and the excitement of being on the front lines of the internet revolution. “Working at Yahoo for people who were young in their career was like going to a large research university,” said Dan Finnigan, a former senior vice president of Yahoo and now president and CEO of Jobvite. “People who started in media went into sales, people who started in sales went into recruiting, people went from engineering to product. It was highly encouraged.” Luanne Calvert, chief marketing officer at Virgin America Inc, was at Yahoo from 1999 to 2002. She credits the experience with making her career. “It was pretty amazing that you could kind of create your own job” at Yahoo, as she did. “I became the queen bee of buzz marketing ... It changed my life in terms of (experience that was) really relevant to the future of marketing.” Many ex-Yahoos are quick to acknowledge that the company eventually lost focus as it grew big and bureaucratic, and came to be dominated internally by endless meetings and powerpoint presentations. By 2010, said Shashi Seth, who arrived that year as a senior vice president, “people just looked at Yahoo as a job. It wasn’t their passion.” Still, even today, the eagerness of ex-Yahoos to work with one another is undiminished. A Meetup group, at least two Facebook groups, a smartphone app called “xY!z Network” and a LinkedIn group with more than 15,000 members tie the ex-Yahoos together. For some, connections with fellow Yahoo alumni turned into lasting business relationships. Slack, the red-hot business messaging upstart, was founded by Flickr creator and former Yahoo executive Stewart Butterfield, and financed by former vice president of Yahoo search Andrew Braccia, who is now a general partner at venture capital firm Accel. Accel has also invested in Cloudera, co-founded by former Yahoo engineering VP Amr Awadallah. Ann Crady Weiss, a former director of business development at Yahoo and co-founder of nursery products company Hatch Baby, said the majority of financing she’s received since leaving Yahoo and starting two businesses “came either directly from a Yahoo person or one degree of separation from a Yahoo person.” “For me, that alumni network and those referrals set me on a path for success,” she said. “Yahoo was critical to my future.” Rob Solomon, former Yahoo senior vice president of commerce and current GoFundMe CEO, last year published a list of several dozen former Yahoo executives who moved on to become Silicon Valley power players. Some of its other illustrious members include LinkedIn Corp CEO Jeff Weiner, WhatsApp co-founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton, and the late SurveyMonkey CEO Dave Goldberg. The power and reach of the Yahoo diaspora, Solomon said, helps dull the pain of the company’s decline. “We know each other, we trust each other,” he said. “We’ve been through a lot together and will all help each other out.” ",7212016,http://www.reuters.com/article/yahoo-workers/rpt-silicon-valleys-yahoo-diaspora-mourns-companys-decline-idUSL1N1A706Z

1120,VZ,Verizon emerges as front-runner in Yahoo auction: sources,"(Reuters) - Yahoo Inc YHOO.O is focusing on U.S. telecommunications company Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) as the buyer of its core business after reviewing final bids that it received this week, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. A deal would boost Verizon’s AOL internet business, which the company acquired last year for $4.4 billion, by giving it access to Yahoo’s advertising technology tools, as well other assets such as search, mail, messenger and real estate. These synergies have made Verizon the favorite among industry analysts to prevail in the auction. The sale would also mark the end of Yahoo as an operating company, leaving it only as the owner of a 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, as well as its 15 percent interest in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N). Those two stakes account for most of Yahoo’s $37 billion market capitalization. Yahoo views Verizon as the buyer that can deliver the most value, but negotiations between the two companies are continuing, and no agreement has yet been reached, the sources said. Yahoo would like to have a deal for the core assets by the end of July, one of the sources added. Bloomberg News, which reported earlier that Verizon was nearing an agreement to buy the Yahoo assets, cited an anonymous source as saying the companies were discussing a price close to $5 billion. Yahoo shares were up 0.6 percent at $39.09 in morning trading, while Verizon rose 1.3 percent to $56.09. The sources requested anonymity because the negotiations are confidential. Verizon and Yahoo did not respond to requests for comment. “Verizon has always been the favorite because it has the largest potential synergies and therefore can pay the most,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. “The price negotiations still can be tough because it also doesn’t need Yahoo. It can put its money into its AOL franchise.”  Verizon is already working on increasing revenue through its go90 ad-supported mobile video service targeted at millennials. The app, which was introduced in October, offers videos from Comedy Central, Vice and other programmers, as well as basketball and football games. Other bidders for the Yahoo assets include Verizon rival AT&T; (T.N); a consortium led by Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert and backed by billionaire Warren Buffett; private equity firm TPG Capital LP; and a consortium of buyout firms Vector Capital and Sycamore Partners, sources have said previously. AOL Chief Executive Officer Tim Armstrong, who made his name leading sales at Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google, is highly regarded in the advertising community. Analysts say it is unlikely that Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, another former Google high-flyer who has struggled to turn her internet company around, would join him at AOL. In December, Yahoo scrapped plans to spin off its Alibaba stake after investors fretted over whether that transaction could have been carried out on a tax-free basis. It instead decided to explore a sale of its core assets, spurred on by activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP. Yahoo said in April that Starboard CEO Jeffrey Smith and three independent directors associated with him would join its board immediately. All four were on a slate that Starboard had proposed to oust Yahoo’s entire board.

Shares of the No. 1 U.S. wireless company, which had risen about 21 percent this year, fell 2 percent shortly after midday. Verizon is focused on combining the media and advertising technology assets of Yahoo and AOL, which it acquired last year, Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said in an interview.  “This is about scale, this is about building viewers, which drives advertisers, and we believe there is a lot of revenue synergy here,” Shammo said.  Verizon had said on Monday that it would buy Yahoo’s core internet properties for $4.83 billion to expand its digital advertising and media business and compete with Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google. The company is looking for new revenue by distributing content and selling ads as its wireless business matures. On a call with investors, Chief Executive Officer Lowell McAdam said advertisers and content partners such as the National Football League were already expressing interest in distributing video to millions of AOL and Yahoo users who visit sites such as the Huffington Post and Yahoo Finance.  The company will disclose details on cost savings from the Yahoo acquisition before the deal closes in the first quarter of 2017, McAdam added.  “All we need to do is take more than our fair share of the growth of the market, and this will be a success for us,” McAdam said. “And we certainly expect to do better than that.”  Some analysts were less optimistic, however. “The core growth engines of the business are sputtering,” MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett said. “Their wireless revenue growth is negative, the wireline business hasn’t been a growth engine for a decade, and they’ve just acquired Yahoo, whose revenues are shrinking double-digits.” Verizon added a net 615,000 wireless retail postpaid subscribers in the second quarter.

1137,VZ,UPDATE 7-Verizon to buy Yahoo's core business for $4.8 bln in digital ad push,"(Adds Australian joint venture response in 5th last graf) By Malathi Nayak and Deborah M. Todd NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO, July 25 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc said on Monday it would buy Yahoo Inc’s core internet properties for $4.83 billion in cash, marking the end of the line for a storied Web pioneer and setting the stage for a big new internet push by the telecom giant. Verizon will combine Yahoo’s search, email and messenger assets as well as advertising technology tools with its AOL unit, which it bought last year for $4.4 billion. Verizon has been looking to mobile video and advertising for new sources of revenue outside the oversaturated wireless market. The No. 1 U.S. wireless operator is betting that it can take data on more than 200 million unique monthly visitors to Yahoo sites, many of them on mobile devices, and combine it with data on 150 million or so unique monthly AOL users and data on its own user base of over 100 million wireless subscribers to offer a more targeted service for advertisers. Barclays said last month Verizon could save $500 million a year in costs of acquiring internet traffic and other expenses by buying Yahoo’s internet business. The deal likely means more investment in popular content sites such as AOL’s Huffington Post and Yahoo Finance when they become part of a much larger entity. “It now becomes somewhat easier to justify investing in content,” said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research. Verizon said it would provide more detail on the strategy behind the acquisition when it announces second-quarter earnings on Tuesday. The deal came after activist investors led by Starboard Value LP lost faith in Yahoo Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer, who was hired in 2012, and forced what became a protracted sale process. Yahoo, founded in 1994, was a dominant player in the early days of the internet, but has long lost its leadership position in internet search and advertising to Alphabet Inc’s  Google, Facebook Inc and others. Mayer said on a conference call with investors that she planned to stay at Yahoo through the deal’s close. Marni Walden, head of product innovation and new business at Verizon, will head the combined internet unit and said no decisions had yet been made on the management team. “Yahoo gives us scale that is what is most critical here,” said Walden, adding that the company’s audience will go from the millions to the billions. “We want to compete and that is the place we need to be.” Mayer, in an interview with Reuters, said she still saw a “path to growth” for Yahoo, especially in mobile. “What’s exciting about the Verizon transaction is that it brings us back to growth sooner,” she said. She said she was “open-minded” about a possible role with the combined companies. But analysts expect AOL CEO Tim Armstrong - like Mayer a one-time Google executive - to be the driving force behind the combined companies. Yahoo is still one of the largest properties on the internet, with hundreds of millions of customers using its email, finance and sports offerings, among others, and a heavily trafficked home page. But Google has a stranglehold on the internet search business and built an industry-leading email service, while Facebook dominates in mobile and social media. Meanwhile, traditional web banner advertising, long Yahoo’s strength, has become much less lucrative in the age of mobile and video. “It’s a decade of mismanagement that has finally ended for Yahoo,” said Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner. “It’s the continuation of an extension of Verizon’s strategy toward becoming a wireless internet player and a move away from (telecom) regulation for Verizon into an unregulated growth industry. Under Armstrong, AOL has beefed up its advertising technology with a string of acquisitions, and launched the mobile video service go90. Verizon has not disclosed how financially successful the unit has been, but Armstrong, known as a formidable salesman, has clearly won the confidence of Verizon’s leaders. The integration of Yahoo will not come without challenges. In its latest results, it reported a second-quarter net loss of $439.9 million as it wrote down the value of Tumblr, the microblogging and social media service it acquired in 2013 for $1.1 billion. Even with AOL and Yahoo, Verizon would still be far behind s Google and Facebook. According to eMarketer, Yahoo is expected to generate $2.32 billion in net U.S. digital ad sales, while AOL is expected to make $1.3 billion in 2016. Facebook and Google are forecast to deliver sales of $10.3 billion and $24.63 billion, respectively, by the end of this year. The Verizon deal would transform Yahoo into a holding company, with a 15 percent stake in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and a 35.5 percent interest in Yahoo Japan Corp as well as Yahoo’s convertible notes, certain minority investments and its non-core patents. Yahoo executives said the remaining company is structured to “indefinitely” hold its Yahoo Japan and Alibaba stakes. They are worth about $40 billion based on their market capitalizations, while Yahoo had a market value of about $37.4 billion at Friday’s close. Australia’s top-rating free-to-air television network Seven West Media, which has an online joint venture with Yahoo, said it will consider “various options” if its 50:50 digital partner gets sold. It declined to name the options but noted that it has “dramatically expanded its digital products” beyond the Yahoo7 business. Yahoo will continue as an independent company until the deal receives shareholder and regulatory approvals, the companies said. It is expected to close in early 2017. It plans to change its name and become a publicly traded investment company. Yahoo currently has $7.7 billion in cash, in addition to the $4.8 billion it will receive at the close of the deal, which it plans to return to shareholders, Yahoo executives said on the call. Verizon prevailed over rival bidders, including AT&T; Inc  ; a group led by Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert and backed by billionaire Warren Buffett; private equity firm TPG Capital Management LP ; and a consortium of buyout firms Vector Capital and Sycamore Partners. Under pressure from Starboard, Yahoo launched an auction of its core business in February after shelving plans to spin off its stake in Alibaba.

1141,VZ,Verizon to buy vehicle management company Fleetmatics for $2.4 billion,"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc said on Monday it would buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc for about $2.4 billion in cash to bolster its expansion into the connected vehicle and fleet management market. Verizon, the No. 1 U.S wireless company, will pay $60 per  share, a premium of about 40 percent to Fleetmatics’ closing price on Friday. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. Shares in Fleetmatics soared 39 percent to $59.60 while Verizon dipped 0.7 percent to $55.01. Fleetmatics, with North American headquarters in Waltham, Massachusetts, develops software that shows fleet operators vehicle location, fuel usage, speed, mileage and other information on their mobile workforce, including a driver’s behavioral data.  As the market for smartphones and mobile devices gets saturated, Verizon and its biggest rival, AT&T; Inc, are hoping that connecting more objects to their networks will provide new revenue.  The acquisition helps Verizon capture market share in the “highly fragmented and pretty under-penetrated” fleet and mobile workforce management business, Andrés Irlando, chief executive officer of Verizon Telematics, said in an interview. The unit connects vehicles to its wireless network and offers applications to track and manage them. On Friday, Verizon Telematics closed another deal, to buy California-based Telogis, which builds software to track commercial vehicles and navigation software used by automakers such as Ford Motor Co. Terms were not disclosed. Verizon Telematics also offers its own fleet management service, called “Networkfleet.”    “Both Telogis in the enterprise space and Fleetmatics in the (small- and medium-sized businesses) space have what’s widely considered best-in-class technology software platforms, as well as products and services,” Irlando said. Fleetmatics’ international presence in regions such as Western Europe and Australia helps Verizon expand the global reach of its telematics business, Irlando added. In May, Fleetmatics posted revenue of $78.9 million for the first quarter, up 21 percent from a year earlier. Verizon does not  break out its telematics unit revenues - it is reported under sales from its larger “Internet of Things” business. Aimed at connecting to the internet everything from household devices to industrial machines, the business posted revenue of $205 million in the second quarter ended June 30, 2016, up 25 percent from a year ago, Verizon said last week.

1155,VZ,Fitch Rates Verizon's Sr. Unsecured Note Offering 'A-'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 06 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to  Verizon Communications Inc.'s (Verizon; NYSE: VZ) $2.059 billion of senior  unsecured 4.2% notes due 2046. Proceeds will be used to repay the $870 million  principal balance of the 4.8% notes due 2044, as well as for general corporate  purposes. The company's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is 'A-' and the  Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS Competitive Position: The ratings are supported by Verizon Wireless's (VZW)  strong competitive position, as evidenced through industry-low churn rates, high  margins and the extensive coverage of approximately 98% of the U.S. population  with its 4G LTE network. These factors are balanced against moderately high  leverage for the rating, which stems from the February 2014 acquisition of the  remaining 45% stake in VZW. Core Telecom Leverage: At June 30, 2016, core telecom leverage was 2.3x and  total adjusted debt/EBITDAR was 2.8x. Including the Yahoo acquisition and other  pending acquisitions, Fitch expects Verizon's core telecom leverage to decline  to approximately 2.2x by 2017 while total adjusted debt/EBITDAR is expected to  approximate 2.8x. Core telecom leverage excludes securitizations (both  off-balance-sheet and public/144A and on-balance-sheet asset-backed  securitizations). Securitizations are included in total adjusted debt/EBITDAR  measures. Pending Acquisitions: In July 2016, Verizon announced a definitive agreement  with Yahoo! Inc. (Yahoo) whereby it will acquire the subsidiaries holding  Yahoo's operating businesses for approximately $4.83 billion in a cash  transaction (subject to closing adjustments). The transaction is expected to  close in early 2017, following customary approvals including approvals by  regulators and Yahoo's shareholders. Verizon's acquisition of XO Communications'  (XO) fiber network business for approximately $1.8 billion is also expected to  close in the first half of 2017. In August 2016, the acquisition of telematics  provider Fleetmatics for $2.4 billion was announced, and the transaction is  expected to close by the end of 2016. Wireline Asset Sale: In April 2016, Verizon completed the sale of its wireline  operations in California, Texas and Florida to Frontier Communications Corp.  (Frontier) for $10.5 billion. Approximately $600 million of debt transferred  with the subsidiaries. Debt Reduction: In April 2016, Verizon used the $10.5 billion in Frontier  proceeds and cash on hand to tender for and redeem early $10.7 billion in  existing debt. Frontier also assumed $600 million in debt of the acquired  entities. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Fitch assumes Verizon's EBITDA grows below 1% in 2016 over 2015. Fitch expects  midsingle digit EBITDA growth in 2017, based on organic revenue growth slightly  below Fitch's expectations for domestic GDP growth plus the effect of  acquisitions. --Debt reduction in the core business, combined with EBITDA growth, is expected  to reduce core telecom leverage to the low 2x range by 2017/2018. --VZW will continue to generate strong free cash flow (FCF) on an operational  basis. VZW's simple FCF (EBITDA less capital spending) for the latest 12 months  (LTM) ended June 30, 2016, was approximately $28.3 billion. --In 2016, Fitch expects consolidated capital spending to be in line with  company guidance of $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion. Investment in the wireless  network continues to be an area of emphasis due to the strong demand for 4G LTE  capacity for rapidly growing data services. --Fitch has included modest spending on spectrum in the FCC's 600 MHz TV  broadcast auction, currently underway. Spectrum spending approaching or  exceeding levels spent in the AWS-3 auction will be an event-driven  consideration.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive Rating Action: Fitch believes a positive rating action is unlikely in  the foreseeable future, given current levels of leverage. Negative Rating Action: Fitch may take a negative rating action if operating  performance causes deleveraging to take place at a materially  slower-than-anticipated pace, either alone or in combination with material  debt-financed acquisitions. Discretionary management moves that cause leverage  to rise above 2.5x, such as another material acquisition or stock repurchases,  could lead to a negative action in the absence of a strong commitment to  deleverage. LIQUIDITY Strong Liquidity Profile: Verizon's liquidity is supported by its reported  consolidated cash balances, which were $2.9 billion at June 30, 2016, and by its  revolving credit facility (RCF). The undrawn $8 billion RCF matures in July 2018. Fitch expects Verizon to  maintain aggregate commercial paper (CP) balances within a level fully backed by  the RCF. The credit facility has no ratings triggers or other restrictive  financial covenants, such as leverage or interest coverage tests. Verizon's cash from operations in 2016 will be negatively affected by certain  items. The company will incur higher cash taxes on a business-as-usual basis as  the cash tax rate moves toward the effective tax rate and by the cash tax  payment arising from the gain on sale of the wireline assets to Frontier.  Additionally, wireless handset financing under the equipment installment  programs will pressure cash from operations, as the public securitizations  funding handset sales beginning in the third quarter of 2016 will be recorded in  cash from financing activities. This is a change in presentation from the  private securitizations undertaken in 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, which  were recorded in operating activities. Further, cash from operations in 2015 was  also boosted on a non-recurring basis by the portion of the tower sale proceeds  (approximately $2.4 billion) recorded in operating activities. Debt Maturities: On a consolidated basis, as of June 30, 2016 Verizon and its  subsidiaries had expected debt maturities of approximately $2.3 billion and $3.8  billion in 2016 and 2017, respectively.

1163,VZ,UPDATE 1-Yahoo is sued for gross negligence over huge hacking,"(Adds details from complaint, company comment, case citation, byline) By Jonathan Stempel Sept 23 (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc was sued on Friday by a user who accused it of gross negligence over a massive 2014 hacking in which information was stolen from at least 500 million accounts. The lawsuit was filed in the federal court in San Jose, California, one day after Yahoo disclosed the hacking, unprecedented in size, by what it believed was a “state-sponsored actor.” Ronald Schwartz, a New York resident, sued on behalf of all Yahoo users in the United States whose personal information was compromised. The lawsuit seeks class-action status and unspecified damages. A Yahoo spokeswoman said the Sunnyvale, California-based company does not discuss pending litigation. The attack could complicate Chief Executive Marissa Mayer’s effort to shore up the website’s flagging fortunes, two months after she agreed to a $4.8 billion sale of Yahoo’s Internet business to Verizon Communications Inc. Yahoo on Thursday said user information including names, email addresses, phone numbers, birth dates and encrypted passwords had been compromised in late 2014. But the lawsuit suggested that the breach might have been warded off had Yahoo, having been targeted by hackers before, lived up to its promise of taking user privacy “seriously” and bulked up its security measures. It also faulted Yahoo for taking roughly three times longer than organizations typically need to uncover the breach. Yahoo demonstrated “reckless disregard for the security of its users’ personal information that it promised to protect,” according to the complaint. Schwartz is represented by two large U.S. class-action specialists, the law firms Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd and Labaton Sucharow. The case is Schwartz v Yahoo Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 16-05456.

1166,VZ,FCC to vote on revised broadband privacy regulations,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission will vote on Oct. 27 on a revised proposal for rules to safeguard privacy of broadband users. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler’s initial proposal came under harsh criticism from internet service providers such as Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T; Inc and Comcast Corp, because it subjected them to more stringent rules than websites like Facebook Inc, Twitter or Alphabet Inc’s Google, which are overseen by Federal Trade Commission rules. Providers had especially objected to sweeping “opt in” requirements under the initial proposal for using nearly all consumer data. Under the new proposal, providers must only get “opt in” or affirmative consent for sensitive data like health, finances, web browsing history, child data, and Social Security numbers. But it allows other data to be used with “opt out” or implied consent for marketing purposes. FCC officials said the new rules are more in line with FTC privacy rules for websites. USTelecom, a trade group representing Verizon, AT&T; and others, said it was concerned the FCC “is now attempting to redefine what consumers may regard as sensitive” and might not agree with the FTC’s definition. Wheeler said the FCC has long required telephone companies to protect information associated with phone calls and now must do the same with internet service. Several consumer groups including the Consumer Federation of America backed the revised proposal, as did Senator Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat. The FCC has authority to set broadband privacy rules after it reclassified broadband providers last year as part of new net neutrality regulations. A federal appeals court upheld that decision in June. Wheeler is working to complete an aggressive agenda this year, including the privacy proposal, as well as rules to reform the $40 billion market for business data services, known as special access lines, and to allow consumers to ditch pay TV set top boxes. A person briefed on the matter said Wheeler was circulating a revised proposal to reform the special access lines Thursday, but has not decided whether to bring it up for a vote on Oct. 27. In September, the FCC said it would delay a final vote on a landmark reform of the $20 billion television set-top box market, which could reduce bills for tens of millions of subscribers. Negotiations among the commissioners were continuing after the FCC’s three Democrats in a joint statement last week expressed support for letting consumers drop set-top boxes, which route cable and broadcasting to televisions. They said they were “working to resolve the remaining technical and legal issues.”",10062016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fcc-privacy/fcc-to-vote-on-revised-broadband-privacy-regulations-idUSKCN1261UZ

1169,VZ,Shine comes off sterling credit despite BoE firepower,"* Bond issuance sees sharp decline * Currency volatility weighs heavily By Laura Benitez LONDON, Oct 7 (IFR) - The cracks began to show in the sterling corporate bond market, just one week into the BoE’s stimulus programme, as indigestion following a spate of new supply and torrid currency moves left investors holding big losses. Companies have issued new sterling bonds relentlessly over the last two months, in bid to secure ultra-low funding costs brought about by the Bank of England’s stimulus measures. But issuance stopped in its tracks this week with just £300m of supply, compared to the £1.1bn sold the week before. “The sterling  market is experiencing some weakness, which hasn’t been helped by the volatility regarding the currency moves this week,” a banker said. The UK currency tanked to a 31-year low on Friday, as fears that Britain will suffer a hard exit from the European Union intensified. The trouble was highlighted earlier in the week, however, when Gatwick Airport attracted just £400m of demand for a £300m 30-year trade, which later capitulated in the after market. The bond crashed down to a cash price bid as low as 97.40 on Tuesday, according to Tradeweb, the day after it priced at 98.8. And as long-dated Gilts slumped on Friday in the wake of sterling’s “flash crash”, that bid collapsed to just 93.50 - more than five points below reoffer. “Gatwick was a real surprise, its deals normally do well and this struggled which tells you that the market is over supplied and needs to cool down,” another banker said. While Gatwick is not yet eligible for the Bank of England’s purchase programme, bankers expected it to emulate the positive momentum seen on Babcock’s deal last week. That issuer, which is also currently ineligible for BoE purchases, lured over £1.1bn of orders for a £250m deal. And eligible names saw even stronger demand last month, with National Grid Gas attracting a mammoth £6bn of demand for its £3bn issue, the largest corporate sterling bond of all time. But bankers said that sterling performance will be closely monitored by investors over the coming weeks, and that only those taking a risk-on approach would opt to buy new deals. The iBoxx sterling benchmark index has widened since the start of the month from tights of 186bp to 194.8bp on Friday, on an asset swap basis, according to Thomson Reuters data. Ironically, the market’s struggle comes as the Bank of England showed its firepower and revealed that it had bought £507m of corporate bonds in the first week of its programme. Over £9bn of investment-grade issuance has printed since the BoE announced its stimulus measures on August 4, as issuers and investor alike sought to take advantage of the opportunity. The central bank has been purchasing investment-grade corporate bonds in the secondary market since last Tuesday, as it looks to buy up to £10bn over the next 18 months via reverse auctions held every Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday. Some bankers remain hopeful that the BoE’s influence will once again take hold next week, and say that a handful of corporates are waiting in the wings. “It’s still an attractive currency for issuers, although we have started to see some decompression in spreads, and price tightening has been more tricky during marketing,” one banker said. “But we’re hopeful that issuers will take next weeks window as there is still interest.” Those planning sterling issuance in the coming weeks include Verizon, which has asked investors for feedback on possible eight-year and 12-year euro-denominated deals, and potentially a 20 to 30-year sterling bond, according to an investor who attended the London leg of the roadshow.

1170,VZ,Civil liberties group urges Verizon to shore up Yahoo user protection,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - An international civil liberties group that has worked with web companies on human rights and surveillance issues is asking Verizon Communications Inc to examine a secret email scanning program run by its acquisition target Yahoo Inc and improve on its user protection record. Access Now, an international digital rights group, wrote to Verizon on Tuesday about scanning conducted in 2015 at the behest of U.S. intelligence authorities and first reported by Reuters last week. Federal officials said the search was at the direction of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and sought emails containing a specific set of characters associated with a terror group backed by another government. Access Now pressed the communications carrier to make sure that Yahoo does more to protect user data, keeps security staff informed of relevant policy decisions and keeps its commitments to surveillance reform. “We have an ongoing and constructive engagement with Access Now and will review their recommendations and consider them carefully,” Verizon said in an emailed statement. The letter, provided to Reuters in advance of its publication on Wednesday on the group’s website, points to mixed feelings among privacy and security experts about the pending $4.8 billion acquisition. Yahoo has in past years enjoyed a good reputation for protecting users from government pressure, lobbying for restrictions on broad searches and appealing warrantless inquiries from the secret U.S. intelligence court. Like other major telecommunications carriers, Verizon has been seen by privacy experts as more closely aligned with the interests of government regulators, law enforcement and intelligence agencies. But Verizon has begun publishing a transparency report of the sort pioneered by web companies, quantifying and explaining government information requests, and it has also fought some data demands in court. Verizon has also observed that Yahoo will give it a more global customer base with different expectations. “They seem to recognize that this is kind of an opportunity to build on the privacy and security commitments that I think are essential when we talk about expanding globally,” said Drew Mitnick, policy counsel at Access Now. Among those who have faulted the Yahoo search or the way it was conducted are members of both houses of Congress, the United Nations special rapporteur on freedom of expression, Ireland’s Data Protection Commissioner and the BEUC, an umbrella group of Europeans consumer groups. Yahoo declined to comment about Access Now’s request. The company’s rights policies are being addressed in the integration process, according to a person familiar with the matter.

1172,VZ,"Verizon says Yahoo hack 'material,' could affect deal","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc  said on Thursday it has a “reasonable basis” to believe Yahoo Inc’s massive data breach of email accounts represents a material impact that could allow Verizon to withdraw from its $4.83 billion deal to buy the technology company. Verizon’s general counsel Craig Silliman told reporters at a roundtable in Washington the data breach could trigger a clause in the deal that would allow the U.S. wireless company not to complete it. “I think we have a reasonable basis to believe right now that the impact is material and we’re looking to Yahoo to demonstrate to us the full impact. If they believe that it’s not then they’ll need to show us that,” he said, declining to comment on whether talks are under way to renegotiate the purchase price. Asked for comment, a Yahoo spokesman said: “We are confident in Yahoo’s value and we continue to work towards integration with Verizon.” The deal has a clause that says Verizon can withdraw if a new event “reasonably can be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, properties, results of operation or financial condition of the business.” Silliman said the U.S. Federal Trade Commission has approved Verizon’s planned acquisition of Yahoo, but it still needs approval from the European Commission and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing the proxy. Verizon has had preliminary briefings from Yahoo but it still needs “significant information” from the company before it makes a final decision on the materiality of the hacking of at least 500 million email accounts, Silliman said. He said Verizon is “absolutely evaluating (the breach) and will make determinations about whether and how to move forward with the deal based on our evaluation of the materiality.” Yahoo shares ended 1.75 percent lower at $41.62, while Verizon was largely unchanged, closing at $50.29, down 0.02 percent. Yahoo in September disclosed that it had fallen victim to a data breach in 2014 that compromised users’ names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth and encrypted passwords. The company has said the cyber attack was carried out by a “state-sponsored” actor, but some private security experts have challenged that assertion. Several Democratic senators have pressed Yahoo to reveal more information about the hack and why it took so long to discover. The internet firm said it learned of the breach this summer while investigating claims of a separate intrusion, but it has not provided a specific timeline of events. Some analysts suggested Verizon may be trying to get a better price. Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics, said “Verizon is rightfully upset about Yahoo not properly disclosing the breach.” He said Yahoo would most likely have to consider renegotiating the price with Verizon, if it came to that. “I don’t think it has much of a choice. Who else would want to buy them?” Entner said. Experts said bidders who try to extract themselves from mergers using the material adverse clause face an uphill battle. No U.S. company has ever invoked the clause successfully in court to get out of a deal. In 2013, Cooper Tire & Rubber company got cold feet about a $2.5 billion sale to Apollo Tyres and argued in the Delaware Court of Chancery that Apollo had seen a material adverse change related to union issues at a subsidiary of the company. The court rejected Cooper Tire’s claims and the deal fell apart. A Delaware court ruled in 2001 that poultry producer Tyson Foods Inc could not terminate its merger with beef producer IBP Inc over accounting irregularities. The court said the shortfall was not due to a long-term problem.

1175,VZ,"UPDATE 3-Verizon closing call centers in five U.S. states, 3,200 jobs affected","(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) said on Thursday it plans to close call centers in five states, including its home state of New York, as the No. 1 wireless company trims head count and reorganizes operations in a saturated wireless market. The move, which will affect 3,200 workers is a part of Verizon’s effort to consolidate customer service operations across the United States. The company, which has a workforce of about 162,700, recently agreed to buy Yahoo Inc YHOO.O for $4.8 billion as it looks to tap new revenue in areas such as digital media and advertising. “We are realigning our real estate portfolio and relocating these centers into other centers where we have extra capacity,” Verizon spokeswoman Kim Ancin said. Verizon is offering affected employees jobs in call centers in other states, she said. The consolidation involves Verizon call centers near Rochester and Orangeburg, New York; Bangor, Maine; Lincoln, Nebraska; Wallingford and Meriden, Connecticut; and Rancho Cordoba, California, the company said. The proposed call center closures, which will impact 850 jobs in New York, drew a testy response from the office of New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo.     “This is an egregious example of corporate abuse – among the worst we have witnessed during the six years of this administration,” Rich Azzopardi, a spokesman for the governor, said in a statement. Verizon’s call center closures will result in job losses for “hard-working” New Yorkers, he added.      Employees who choose to move to other call centers, which handle sales and billing and help customers with technical problems, will be given relocation packages starting at $10,000, Ancin said. Those who leave the company will be given a severance package, outplacement resources and other support. In April, nearly 40,000 employees of the wireline business, which includes FiOS Internet, telephone and TV services, represented by unions, went on strike after reaching an impasse in talks over a new labor contract. Sticking points included the relocation of employees and offshoring of call center jobs. The strike, which was one of the largest in recent years in the United States, drew support from Democratic U.S. Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. A new deal was reached in May and striking wireline employees got back to work in June. The Verizon wireless call center closures in five states involve employees who are not represented by unions, Ancin said.

1182,VZ,"UPDATE 3-Yahoo profit beats Wall St, some analysts worry over effect of hack","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc reported better-than-expected quarterly adjusted profit on Tuesday, a boost for the beleaguered company whose deal to sell its core business to Verizon Communications Inc has been shaken by a massive data breach. Verizon’s general counsel said last week that the hack, which affected at least 500 million email accounts in 2014, could have a material impact, possibly allowing Verizon to withdraw from the $4.83 billion deal. Tuesday’s results provided at least an initial indication that the data breach has not led to a quick exodus of Yahoo customers, as some had feared. Customer trends showed growth in pageviews and email usage, Yahoo said. Still, analysts were split on whether the results dispelled doubts about the deal going through. Yahoo said in a filing with securities regulators shortly before the breach was disclosed that it knew of no cyber risks, raising questions about whether Verizon was informed of the breach in a timely fashion.   JMP Securities analyst Ronald Josey said it was too early to tell if the breach would cause lasting damage, and called customer trends “encouraging.” “The message here is email and messaging is a very sticky product and people want to get to their messages,” said Josey. But Fatemeh Khatibloo, a security analyst with Forrester Research, said the uptick in pageviews and email usage could be the result of “500 million people trying to figure out if they’re exposed.” Any loss of users in the future, lawsuits related to the breach and a pending Federal Communications Commission vote that could limit how telecommunications companies can use customer data may encourage Verizon to try and back out of the deal, said Khatibloo. However, Scott Kessler, an analyst with CFRA Research, said the fact that Yahoo did not see an immediate decline in users was a sign the breach may not be a material adverse change that would affect the Verizon deal. “The bottom line here is from a fundamental operational and financial perspective, it doesn’t seem like much has changed at the company over the last quarter,” he said. Legal experts have said Verizon would have to clear a high hurdle to prove that the breach amounted to a material adverse change that would allow it to pull out of the deal. Another positive sign for Yahoo was that revenue from Mavens - the mobile, video, native and social advertising units that Chief Executive Marissa Mayer touts as its emerging businesses - rose 24.2 percent to $524 million. Still, the business showed continuing declines in major revenue categories. Gross search revenue fell 14.1 percent to $752.5 million.  Total revenue rose 6.5 percent to $1.31 billion, just beating the average analyst estimate of $1.30 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. But after deducting fees paid to partner websites, revenue fell to $857.7 million from $1 billion. Yahoo said on Friday it would not hold a call or webcast after the release of the results, citing the Verizon deal. Analysts at Needham & Co said in a note on Tuesday that decision troubled them, given doubts cast over the Verizon deal by the data hack, and they cut their rating on Yahoo to ‘hold’ from ‘buy’.  Yahoo’s shares were up about 1.3 percent in extended trading after the close on Tuesday.  For the third quarter ended Sept. 30, net income attributable to Yahoo rose to $162.8 million, or 17 cents per share, from $76.3 million, or 8 cents per share, a year earlier.  Excluding some items, the company earned 20 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of 14 cents. Verizon plans to combine Yahoo’s search, email and messenger assets as well as advertising technology tools with its AOL unit, which it bought last year for $4.4 billion. The deal would transform Yahoo into a holding company, with a 15 percent stake in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and a 35.5 percent interest in Yahoo Japan Corp as well as Yahoo’s convertible notes, certain minority investments and its non-core patents.

1186,VZ,"Yahoo profit beats Wall St., some analysts worry over effect of hack","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc reported better-than-expected quarterly adjusted profit on Tuesday, a boost for the beleaguered company whose deal to sell its core business to Verizon Communications Inc has been shaken by a massive data breach. Verizon’s general counsel said last week that the hack, which affected at least 500 million email accounts in 2014, could have a material impact, possibly allowing Verizon to withdraw from the $4.83 billion deal. Tuesday’s results provided at least an initial indication that the data breach has not led to a quick exodus of Yahoo customers, as some had feared. Customer trends showed growth in pageviews and email usage, Yahoo said. Still, analysts were split on whether the results dispelled doubts about the deal going through. Yahoo said in a filing with securities regulators shortly before the breach was disclosed that it knew of no cyber risks, raising questions about whether Verizon was informed of the breach in a timely fashion.   JMP Securities analyst Ronald Josey said it was too early to tell if the breach would cause lasting damage, and called customer trends “encouraging.” “The message here is email and messaging is a very sticky product and people want to get to their messages,” said Josey. But Fatemeh Khatibloo, a security analyst with Forrester Research, said the uptick in pageviews and email usage could be the result of “500 million people trying to figure out if they’re exposed.” Any loss of users in the future, lawsuits related to the breach and a pending Federal Communications Commission vote that could limit how telecommunications companies can use customer data may encourage Verizon to try and back out of the deal, said Khatibloo. However, Scott Kessler, an analyst with CFRA Research, said the fact that Yahoo did not see an immediate decline in users was a sign the breach may not be a material adverse change that would affect the Verizon deal. “The bottom line here is from a fundamental operational and financial perspective, it doesn’t seem like much has changed at the company over the last quarter,” he said. Legal experts have said Verizon would have to clear a high hurdle to prove that the breach amounted to a material adverse change that would allow it to pull out of the deal. Another positive sign for Yahoo was that revenue from Mavens - the mobile, video, native and social advertising units that Chief Executive Marissa Mayer touts as its emerging businesses - rose 24.2 percent to $524 million. Still, the business showed continuing declines in major revenue categories. Gross search revenue fell 14.1 percent to $752.5 million.  Total revenue rose 6.5 percent to $1.31 billion, just beating the average analyst estimate of $1.30 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. But after deducting fees paid to partner websites, revenue fell to $857.7 million from $1 billion. Yahoo said on Friday it would not hold a call or webcast after the release of the results, citing the Verizon deal. Analysts at Needham & Co said in a note on Tuesday that decision troubled them, given doubts cast over the Verizon deal by the data hack, and they cut their rating on Yahoo to ‘hold’ from ‘buy’.  Yahoo’s shares were up about 1.3 percent in extended trading after the close on Tuesday.  For the third quarter ended Sept. 30, net income attributable to Yahoo rose to $162.8 million, or 17 cents per share, from $76.3 million, or 8 cents per share, a year earlier.  Excluding some items, the company earned 20 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of 14 cents. Verizon plans to combine Yahoo’s search, email and messenger assets as well as advertising technology tools with its AOL unit, which it bought last year for $4.4 billion. The deal would transform Yahoo into a holding company, with a 15 percent stake in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and a 35.5 percent interest in Yahoo Japan Corp as well as Yahoo’s convertible notes, certain minority investments and its non-core patents. The deal is expected to close in early 2017, after which Yahoo plans to change its name and become a publicly traded investment company.

1187,VZ,Verizon revenue drops as subscriber additions disappoint,"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc  added fewer than expected wireless subscribers in the third quarter due to intense competition, and indicated it may renegotiate a deal to buy Yahoo Inc after a breach of Yahoo user email accounts. As its bread-and-butter wireless operations struggle in a saturated phone market, Verizon had said in July it would buy Yahoo’s core business for $4.83 billion to drive growth in advertising and media.  The company said on Thursday total operating revenue in the quarter fell 6.7 percent to $30.94 billion, from $33.16 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of $31.14 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of Verizon, the No.1 U.S. wireless company, slipped 2.7 percent to $49.04 in afternoon trading. The stock has gained more than 6 percent this year so far.  Verizon added a net 442,000 retail postpaid subscribers, who pay their bills on a monthly basis. This was significantly below analysts’ estimated 766,300, according to market research firm FactSet StreetAccount. Subscriber growth in the third quarter was partly hurt by a recent recall of the Samsung Note 7 smartphone due to the risk of overheating and catching fire, and a backlog in orders for Apple’s new iPhone 7, Verizon executives said.  Smaller rivals, such as T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp, have rolled out aggressive promotions to win over Verizon’s subscriber base.  To fend off rivals in a maturing wireless market, it acquired AOL in 2015. Verizon’s planned purchase of Yahoo will give it digital web properties and ad technology tools, allowing it to compete with internet giants like Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google.    “It will take years to find out if their advertising strategy pans out,” MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett said in a note.  Verizon’s general counsel has said that a Yahoo data breach reported in September, which involved 500 million email accounts, was a material event that could allow Verizon to back out of the deal. Verizon was still evaluating what the data breach may mean for the Yahoo transaction, Verizon’s Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said in an interview. “We’re going to have to wait to see and get the facts...before any final decision is made,” Shammo said. Net income attributable to Verizon fell to $3.62 billion, or 89 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $4.04 billion, or 99 cents per share, a year earlier.

1188,VZ,"GLOBAL MARKETS-Dollar hits 7-mth high on ECB's Draghi, pressures oil, stocks","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The euro fell to a four-month low against the U.S. dollar on Thursday and the greenback rose to its highest in seven months against a basket of major currencies after the European Central Bank President left the door open to more monetary stimulus. The rise in the U.S. dollar knocked down oil prices which are traded in dollars and pressured U.S. stock prices. The ECB left its ultra-loose monetary policy unchanged but President Mario Draghi kept a wide range of options open for further stimulus in December, shooting down any talk of tapering its 1.7 trillion euro asset-buying program. The U.S. dollar gained further after publication of a stronger-than-expected U.S. existing home sales report. “The move in the dollar hurt oil, which hurt energy, which hurt stocks,” said Stephen Guilfoyle, chief market economist at Stuart Frankel & Co. Crude oil prices fell just under 2.5 percent, also weighed by profit taking. A strong rally on Wednesday had taken prices to their highest in 15 months in the wake of unexpected inventory drawdowns. U.S. stocks were also pushed lower by weak earnings reports from index heavyweights such as telephone service provider Verizon Communications Inc  and insurer Travelers Companies, Inc . Telecom stocks were the worst-performing sector, down 2 percent, their worst one-day percentage drop since Sept. 9. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 40.27 points, or 0.22 percent, to 18,162.35. The S&P; 500 lost 2.95 points, or 0.14 percent, to 2,141.34 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 4.58 points, or 0.09 percent, to 5,241.83. A measure of world equity markets .MIWD00000PUS fell 0.14 percent after touching a fresh one-week high following Draghi’s comments. European equities jumped following Draghi’s remarks, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index rising more than 1.0 percent from its lows before closing up 0.19 percent. The euro fell as low as $1.0916 versus the U.S. dollar, its lowest since June 24, helping the dollar index rise to its highest since March 10. “Draghi pushed back strongly against the idea that they could discuss tapering or adjusting QE and that weighed on the euro,” said Vassili Serebriakov, FX strategist at Credit Agricole in New York. The ECB head’s comments weighed on longer-dated U.S. Treasury prices, which dipped modestly. Benchmark 10-year notes were last down 1/32 in price to yield 1.749 percent. The greenback was also supported by relatively hawkish comments by New York Fed President William Dudley late on Wednesday. Dudley, a permanent voter on policy and a close ally of Fed Chair Janet Yellen, said the U.S. central bank would likely raise interest rates later this year if the U.S. economy remained on track. The Mexican peso fell on Thursday after touching a six-week high in the immediate aftermath of the U.S. presidential debate between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton on Wednesday. The peso is seen as the chief proxy for market pricing of the Republican candidate’s chances in view of his promises to impose tough limits on immigration and rewrite trade deals. “The early polls suggest Clinton was once again the winner here and so the Mexican peso has been one of the most obvious beneficiaries,” said James Athey, fixed income investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management. “The magnitude of the move, however, suggests that the market has largely concluded that Trump won’t win. That doesn’t mean that the result is a foregone conclusion. Markets, pollsters and pundits all predicted the wrong result in the UK’s referendum on EU membership. That should act as a cursory lesson now.” ",10202016,http://www.reuters.com/article/global-markets/global-markets-dollar-hits-7-mth-high-on-ecbs-draghi-pressures-oil-stocks-idUSL1N1CQ23C
1189,VZ,US STOCKS-Wall St dips as Verizon drags; AmEx curbs losses,"* AmEx set for best day in 7 years on results, forecast * Verizon, Travelers fall on weak reports * Dow up 0.09 pct, S&P; down 0.11 pct, Nasdaq down 0.15 pct   (Updates to late afternoon, changes byline) By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, Oct 20 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks declined modestly in a choppy session on Thursday as investors digested the latest round of earnings, with telecoms suffering a sharp drop in the wake of results from Verizon Communications. Telecoms were down 1.9 percent, on track for their biggest percentage decline in five weeks, as Verizon lost 2.7 percent. The company added fewer than expected wireless subscribers in the third quarter and revenue fell short of expectations. But a 10.3 percent jump in AmEx helped offset the decline after the credit card issuer posted strong quarterly results and boosted its 2016 forecast. The gains put the stock on track for its best day in over seven years and helped send the financial sector higher for a third straight session. Earnings from Bank of New York Mellon, up 4 percent to $42.05, also boosted financials. “Financials for the most part since the earnings season started have been pretty solid, but telecoms not, therefore they are dragging down the market,” said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin. “It’s not a big up day or a big down day - we’ve been up-and-down, up-and-down all day.” Not all financials were able to provide a lift. Property and casualty insurer Travelers, dropped 6.1 percent after a steep drop in profit. Thomson Reuters data earlier this week showed earnings were now expected to show growth for the quarter after companies in the S&P; 500 began an earnings recession in the third quarter of 2015. But with about 85 percent of S&P; 500 companies left to report, there is still room for earnings to disappoint. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 16.88 points, or 0.09 percent, to 18,185.74, the S&P; 500 lost 2.39 points, or 0.11 percent, to 2,141.9 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 7.62 points, or 0.15 percent, to 5,238.79. The S&P; 500 has struggled in recent sessions to climb above its technical resistance level at the 100-day moving average, which currently stands at 2,142.60. The level had acted as support for the index until it broke below the level last week. Healthcare also served to curb declines, led by a 4.5 percent climb in Danaher after its quarterly results. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.48-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.22-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P; 500 posted 5 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 51 new highs and 54 new lows.

Verizon fell 2.3 percent, dragging the most on the S&P;, after the wireless carrier reported a drop in quarterly revenue. Rival AT&T; fell 2 percent. The telecom services sector tumbled 1.9 percent, the most among the 11 major S&P; 500 indexes. The next biggest loser was the energy index, which was off 1.1 percent. Oil prices fell the most in four weeks on profit taking and the dollar’s rise. The biggest drag however was the technology sectors’  0.65 percent decline. Earnings of tech companies have been a spot of bother in the latest quarter. EBay tumbled 10 percent after a disappointing current-quarter forecast. Microsoft, scheduled to report after the bell, fell 1.3 percent, weighing the most on the Nasdaq. The top drag on the Dow was Travelers, which fell 4.28 percent after the insurer posted a steep drop in profit. The mostly dour reports could dent the chances of S&P; 500 companies having snapped a four-quarter earnings recession in the third quarter. Helping the Dow and the S&P; cut some losses was American Express’s 8.9 percent jump following its strong results and forecast. Of the 70 S&P; 500 companies that had reported results until Wednesday, about 80 percent beat profit estimates. Earnings are expected to have risen 0.5 percent in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “There hasn’t been a rash of earnings misses, but when you are in-line and you have lukewarm forward guidance, the market doesn’t get very excited about that, especially considering that expectations are already low,” said Chris Zaccarelli, Chief Investment Officer for Cornerstone Financial Partners. “With valuations on the higher end of historical averages, you want to see strong earnings across the board and I think the market’s a little bit underwhelmed right now.” At 10:52 a.m. ET (1452 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 66.19 points, or 0.36 percent, at 18,136.43. The S&P; 500 was down 9.02 points, or 0.42 percent, at 2,135.27 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 25.11 points, or 0.48 percent, at 5,221.31. Nine of the 11 major S&P; 500 indexes were lower, with the healthcare and utilities sectors posting marginal gains.

Legere also said he does not expect regulators to allow AT&T; to exclusively deliver Time Warner’s content. “AT&T; may end up being a provider to us of content as opposed to anybody thinking that there is any possibility that they will exclusively use that content,” Legere said on a call with analysts. Shares of T-Mobile, controlled by Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE), were up 7.44 at $50.22 in midday trading after touching a nine-year high of $50.41. “We see no need for T-Mobile or Sprint to do anything as a result of (AT&T;’s) announcement and instead to keep doing what they are doing and that’s steal share from AT&T; and Verizon,” Cowen and Company analyst Colby Synesael said in a client note. T-Mobile US said it now expected to add 3.7-3.9 million branded postpaid customers, or customers who pay monthly bills, on a net basis this year, higher than its previous forecast of 3.4-3.8 million. The company added 969,000 postpaid customers in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, up from 890,000 in the second quarter. In contrast, AT&T; lost customers in the quarter, while Verizon’s subscriber addition was well below analysts’ estimates. T-Mobile said it benefited from the launch of Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) iPhone 7 and an increase in branded prepaid customer migrating to postpaid plans. T-Mobile’s net income surged to $366 million from $138 million, helped by after-tax spectrum gains of $122 million. On an adjusted basis, it earned 27 cents per share. Total revenue rose 17.8 percent to $9.25 billion. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 22 cents per share and revenue of $9.42 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Wells Fargo said the slight revenue miss was due to lower-than-expected equipment revenue partly due to T-Mobile’s “free” iPhone 7 promotion.

1196,VZ,U.S. funds downbeat on AT&T; even before Time Warner deal,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Many actively managed U.S. mutual funds were cool toward AT&T; Inc even before the telecom giant’s planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc. The chilly attitude from professional stock pickers partly explains the lackluster reception for AT&T;’s planned takeover of Time Warner.  Large-cap growth funds, for example, prefer tech companies whose operations require less capital than a regulated telecom operator like AT&T.;  Even a major benefit to owning AT&T; - its juicy 5 percent-plus dividend yield - is a cause for investor concern as higher interest rates may make the return look less attractive. “There will be more options available for other, higher-yielding assets if rates are going up,” said Carrie Tallman, director of research at Parsec Financial, a North Carolina financial adviser that owns shares of AT&T; and Time Warner. Approval of AT&T;’s proposed takeover has provoked broad skepticism as the deal faces some of the toughest regulatory scrutiny in recent U.S. history of mergers and acquisitions. “We are committed to our dividend and to maintaining the financial flexibility for the board to consider future growth in the dividend,” AT&T; spokeswoman Emily Edmonds said in email. “On Saturday we announced we’ll increase our quarterly dividend for the 33rd straight year, even as we announced we’ve secured a $40 billion bridge facility to finance our acquisition of Time Warner.” Meanwhile, seven out of AT&T;’s 10 largest fund investors are passive index funds, which are obligated to buy the stock because they track the S&P; 500 Index, or other benchmarks that count AT&T; as a component.  Overall, more than 600 index funds own nearly 13 percent of AT&T;’s shares, according to Thomson Reuters data. That is more than actively managed income, value and growth funds combined, which hold about 8 percent of AT&T; shares.  By contrast, those types of actively managed funds hold nearly 18 percent of the shares of rival Verizon Communications Inc, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Large-cap growth portfolio managers like Fidelity Contrafund’s Will Danoff see AT&T; as a regulated, capital intensive, slow growth company. Danoff, who oversees about $109 billion for the fund, does not own any AT&T; shares, telling investors in recent commentary he has largely avoided telecom stocks. Only 21 out of 181 large-cap growth funds tracked by Lipper Inc held AT&T; shares. During the first half of this year, not owning AT&T; hurt these funds’ relative performance to the S&P; 500 because the stock surged 26 percent.  Retail investors piled into AT&T; as the hunt for yield intensified against a backdrop of historically low interest rates. AT&T;’s current dividend yield is 5.3 percent on an annualized basis.     Matthew Benkendorf, chief investment officer of Vontobel Asset Management, a subadviser to Virtus mutual funds, said low rates have undoubtedly driven increased interest in stocks like AT&T.;  But in recent months, as higher U.S. interest rates appear more likely, AT&T; shares have been under pressure. The stock is off 14 percent in the past three months, reflecting interest rate concerns and Saturday’s announcement of the Time Warner deal. Questions for investors now include whether Time Warner’s TV and film assets can deliver meaningful growth for AT&T;, and whether the new conglomerate will continue to satisfy an important base of investors with a healthy dividend payout. Vontobel’s Benkendorf said an added wrinkle to those questions is the sustainability of the dividend AT&T; is paying. “That is a real question for them,” he said.

1198,VZ,Fitch Rates Verizon's Sr. Unsecured Note Offering 'A-'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 26 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to Verizon  Communications Inc.'s (Verizon; NYSE: VZ) multi-tranche offering of Euro and  Sterling senior unsecured notes. Proceeds will be used for general corporate  purposes, including the acquisitions of Fleetmatics Group PLC and XO Holdings'  wireline assets as well as for the potential repayment of debt, depending on  market conditions. Verizon's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is 'A-' and  the Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS Competitive Position: The ratings are supported by Verizon Wireless's (VZW)  strong competitive position, as evidenced through industry-low churn rates, high  margins and the extensive coverage of approximately 98% of the U.S. population  with its 4G LTE network. These factors are balanced against moderately high  leverage for the rating, which stems from the February 2014 acquisition of the  remaining 45% stake in VZW. Core Telecom Leverage: At Sept. 30, 2016, core telecom leverage was 2.4x and  total adjusted debt/EBITDAR was 2.9x. Including the Yahoo acquisition and other  pending acquisitions, Fitch expects Verizon's core telecom leverage to decline  to approximately 2.2x by 2017 while total adjusted debt/EBITDAR is expected to  approximate 2.8x. Core telecom leverage excludes securitizations (both  off-balance-sheet and public/144A and on-balance-sheet asset-backed  securitizations). Securitizations are included in total adjusted debt/EBITDAR  measures. Pending Acquisitions: In July 2016, Verizon announced a definitive agreement  with Yahoo! Inc. (Yahoo) whereby it will acquire the subsidiaries holding  Yahoo's operating businesses for approximately $4.83 billion in a cash  transaction (subject to closing adjustments). In September 2016, Yahoo disclosed  that a copy of certain information related to approximately 500 million user  accounts was stolen; this could have a material adverse effect on the  transaction and Verizon is evaluating the impact of the event on the  transaction. The transaction is expected to close in early 2017, following  customary approvals including approvals by regulators and Yahoo's shareholders.  Verizon's acquisition of XO Communications' (XO) fiber network business for  approximately $1.8 billion is expected to close by the end of the first quarter  of 2017 (1Q17). In August 2016, the acquisition of telematics provider  Fleetmatics for $2.4 billion was announced, and the transaction is expected to  close by the end of 2016. Wireline Asset Sale: In April 2016, Verizon completed the sale of its wireline  operations in California, Texas and Florida to Frontier Communications Corp.  (Frontier) for pre-tax proceeds of $10.5 billion. Approximately $600 million of  debt transferred with the subsidiaries. In April 2016, Verizon used the $10.5  billion in pre-tax proceeds and cash on hand to tender for and redeem early  $10.7 billion in existing debt.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Fitch assumes Verizon's EBITDA grows below 1% in 2016 over 2015. Fitch expects  midsingle digit EBITDA growth in 2017, based on organic revenue growth slightly  below Fitch's expectations for domestic GDP growth plus the effect of  acquisitions. --Debt reduction in the core business, combined with EBITDA growth, is expected  to reduce core telecom leverage to the low 2x range by 2017/2018. --VZW will continue to generate strong free cash flow (FCF) on an operational  basis. VZW's simple FCF (EBITDA less capital spending) for the latest 12 months  (LTM) ended Sept. 30, 2016, was approximately $28.5 billion. --In 2016, Fitch expects consolidated capital spending to be at the low end of  company guidance of $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion. Investment in the wireless  network continues to be an area of emphasis due to the strong demand for 4G LTE  capacity for rapidly growing data services. --Fitch has included modest spending on spectrum in the FCC's 600 MHz TV  broadcast auction, currently underway. Spectrum spending approaching or  exceeding levels spent in the AWS-3 auction will be an event-driven  consideration.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive Rating Action: Fitch believes a positive rating action is unlikely in  the foreseeable future, given current levels of leverage. Negative Rating Action: Fitch may take a negative rating action if operating  performance causes deleveraging to take place at a materially  slower-than-anticipated pace, either alone or in combination with material  debt-financed acquisitions. Discretionary management moves that cause leverage  to rise above 2.5x, such as another material acquisition or stock repurchases,  could lead to a negative action in the absence of a strong commitment to  deleverage. LIQUIDITY Strong Liquidity Profile: Verizon's liquidity is supported by its reported  consolidated cash balances, which were $6.4 billion at Sept. 30, 2016, and by  its undrawn revolving credit facility (RCF). In 3Q16, Verizon amended its RCF, increasing its availability to $9 billion from  $8 billion and extending its maturity to September 2020 from July 2018. Fitch  expects Verizon to maintain aggregate commercial paper (CP) balances within a  level fully backed by the RCF. The credit facility has no ratings triggers or  other restrictive financial covenants, such as leverage or interest coverage  tests. Verizon's cash from operations in 2016 will be negatively affected by certain  items. The company will incur higher cash taxes on a business-as-usual basis as  the cash tax rate moves toward the effective tax rate and by the cash tax  payment arising from the gain on sale of the wireline assets to Frontier.  Additionally, wireless handset financing under the equipment installment  programs will pressure cash from operations, as the public securitizations  funding handset sales beginning in the third quarter of 2016 will be recorded in  cash from financing activities. This is a change in presentation from the  private securitizations undertaken in 2015 and 1Q16, which were recorded in  operating activities. Further, cash from operations in 2015 was also boosted on  a non-recurring basis by the portion of the tower sale proceeds (approximately  $2.4 billion) recorded in operating activities. Debt Maturities: On a consolidated basis, as of Sept. 30, 2016, Verizon and its  subsidiaries had no material maturities remaining in 2016, and expected debt  maturities of approximately $3.8 billion in 2017.

1199,VZ,Verizon executive says company needs more information about Yahoo hack,"(Reuters) - A Verizon Communications Inc executive said the acquisition of Yahoo Inc still makes sense, but the telecommunications company needs more information about the email provider’s massive breach of accounts. Speaking at a tech conference hosted by the Wall Street Journal in Laguna Beach, California, Marni Walden, an executive vice president at Verizon, said on Wednesday Yahoo is investigating the 2014 data breach and that she hopes to resolve any questions related to the incident in 60 days.  “I’ve got an obligation to make sure that we protect our shareholders and our investors, so we’re not going to jump off a cliff blindly,” said Walden, who is also Verizon’s president of Product Innovation and New Businesses. Verizon announced in July that it would buy long-struggling Yahoo for $4.83 billion. But in September, Yahoo disclosed that it had fallen victim to a data breach in 2014 that compromised users’ names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth and encrypted passwords, raising questions about whether Verizon would withdraw from the deal or renegotiate. Walden stressed that the deal still achieves Verizon’s aim of uniting its AOL subsidiary and Yahoo’s audiences to challenge Facebook and Google in online advertising.  “You bring them together, and you can be a relevant third player in this space,” she said. With Facebook dominant in social media and Google in search, Verizon can stand out in the market by catering to brands, Walden said. “We can help other brands build inside of a very open, friendly marketplace,” she said.

1204,VZ,"UPDATE 2-Dish Network posts lower-than-expected profit, loses subscribers","(Reuters) - U.S. satellite TV operator Dish Network Corp (DISH.O) reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday as it lost more pay-TV subscribers due to stiff competition from online video services. Shares in Dish were up about 1.5 percent at $57.56 in early-afternoon trading after paring earlier losses. Dish said it posted a smaller-than-expected loss of 116,000 pay-TV subscribers on a net basis in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, compared to a loss of 23,000 subscribers a year earlier.  Analysts on average had expected a decline of 142,000, according to market research firm FactSet StreetEstimate. Dish’s pay-TV subscriber numbers include satellite TV and its online streaming service, Sling TV. The company’s satellite TV service, its mainstay, has been under pressure as more customers shift to online streaming services such as Netflix (NFLX.O) and ditch traditional cable, a trend known as “cord-cutting”.  Sling TV is expected to face tough competition from AT&T;’s upcoming DirecTV Now streaming video service and Hulu’s live online TV service that is expected to launch next year, analysts say. Last year, Dish launched Sling TV, a cheaper online streaming service with a slim bundle of channels, including live programing from networks such as ESPN. A monthly Sling TV subscription costs $20 for 28 channels and $40 for over 50 channels. AT&T; Inc (T.N), which announced plans to buy Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) last month for $85.4 billion, plans to launch DirecTV Now in late November. It will cost $35 per month, including mobile streaming costs, and have over 100 channels.  Dish will have to invest more on marketing Sling TV and “do creative deals” with content owners to compete, Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner said. Dish has amassed a treasure trove of wireless spectrum in recent years that analysts have valued at nearly $45 billion. The company has been long considered an acquisition target for AT&T; or Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) to boost their wireless networks.  AT&T;’s Time Warner deal “presumably takes AT&T; out of the running as a potential suitor,” MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett said in a note on Wednesday. Net income attributable to Dish rose to $307 million, or 64 cents per share, in the third quarter, from $196 million, or 42 cents per share, a year earlier. Total revenue rose slightly to $3.75 billion from $3.73 billion. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 68 cents per share and revenue of $3.74 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

1209,VZ,"AOL to cut 500 jobs, mostly in corporate units: source","(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc’s (VZ.N) AOL digital media unit will lay off 5 percent of its workforce, or about 500 people, to consolidate operations after recent acquisitions, a person familiar with the situation said on Thursday. Most of the cuts will be in corporate units, including human resources, finance, marketing and communications, while resources will be shifted to AOL’s mobile, video and data businesses, the source said.

1212,VZ,Verizon to sell data centers to Equinix for $3.6 billion,"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier, is selling 29 data centers in the United States and Latin America to Equinix Inc (EQIX.O) for $3.6 billion, as the telecom giant focuses on its core business. The data centers being sold are located in 15 metro areas, including New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Bogota and Sao Paulo. The sale represents Verizon’s efforts to streamline its business and follows the divestment last year of a chunk of its landline business and a portfolio of wireless towers. The enterprise telecommunications industry has had to adapt in recent years to corporate customers seeking more sophisticated and cheaper offerings to manage their data. Verizon, which bought data center company Terremark Worldwide for $1.4 billion in 2011, has been facing stiff competition from companies such as T-Mobile US Inc TMUS.N and Sprint Corp (S.N), which offer deep discounts on cellphone and data plans. Verizon has pivoted to mobile video and advertising by making high-profile acquisitions - it is buying Yahoo for $4.83 billion, and had picked up AOL for $4.4 billion last year. Reuters reported earlier this year that Verizon had launched an auction to sell the data center assets. The company said about 250 Verizon employees, mainly in the operations functions of the acquired data centers, will become Equinix employees. For Equinix, the world’s biggest provider of data centers, the acquisition further bolsters its presence in the Americas. “We’ve been looking at these assets for a long time ...(they) check a number of strategic boxes for us,” Equinix Americas President Karl Strohmeyer said in a call with analysts. The acquired portfolio includes about 900 customers, bringing Equinix’s total number of data centers to 175 in 43 markets. Equinix was advised by Evercore, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP. Citi and Guggenheim Partners were financial advisers to Verizon, while Jones Day provided legal counsel to Verizon. Shares of Equinix were up 1.8 percent at $337.98, while Verizon was little changed in early trading.

1213,VZ,LPC-Equinix doubles acquisition loan to €1 billion,"LONDON (Reuters) - US data center operator Equinix (EQIX.O) has doubled the size of a leveraged loan it is raising to back its acquisition of data centers from Verizon Communications (VZ.N), increasing it to €1bn and tightening pricing following overwhelming investor demand, banking sources said on Wednesday. The company announced earlier this month it would acquire 29 data centers in the US and Latin America for US$3.6bn. Equinix originally planned to back the acquisition with a €500m term loan and a mix of equity and bonds. The increase in the term loan will mean the company will now purchase the data centers with less equity and bonds, the sources said.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch leads the financing, with the €1bn term loan B now offered at par, compared to a 99.75 OID guided at launch. An interest margin of 325bp over Euribor and a 0% floor remain unchanged.  The company is also seeking to amend and reprice an existing US$248m term loan and a US$388m-equivalent sterling-denominated term loan. Pricing on the dollar term loan is guided at 250bp-275bp over Libor, with a 0% floor at par, while the sterling-denominated loan is guided at 300bp-325bp over Libor, with a 0.75% floor at par. The euro, dollar and sterling term loans, which mature in 2023, will have 101 soft call protection for six months.  Lenders have been asked to recommit to the financing by noon on December 15 on the new euro term loan and existing sterling loan, and by 5pm on December 14 for the existing dollar loan.

1214,VZ,"Yahoo under scrutiny after latest hack, Verizon seeks new deal terms","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc YHOO.O came under renewed scrutiny by federal investigators and lawmakers on Thursday after disclosing the largest known data breach in history, prompting Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) to demand better terms for its planned purchase of Yahoo’s internet business. Shares of the Sunnyvale, California-based internet pioneer fell more than 6 percent after it announced the breach of data belonging to more than 1 billion users late on Wednesday, following another large hack reported in September. Verizon, which agreed to buy Yahoo’s core internet business in July for $4.8 billion, is now trying to persuade Yahoo to amend the terms of the acquisition agreement to reflect the economic damage from the two hacks, according to people familiar with the matter. The U.S. No. 1 wireless carrier still expects to go through with the deal, but is looking for “major concessions” in light of the most recent breach, according to another person familiar with the situation. Asked about the status of the deal, a Yahoo spokesperson said: “We are confident in Yahoo’s value and we continue to work towards integration with Verizon.” Verizon had already said in October it was reviewing the deal after September’s breach disclosure. Late on Wednesday, it said it would “review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions” about whether to proceed.  The company declined to comment beyond that statement on Thursday.  Verizon has threatened to go to court to get out of the deal if it is not repriced, citing a material adverse effect, said the people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. No court in Delaware, where Yahoo is incorporated, has ever found that a material adverse effect has occurred that would allow companies to terminate a merger agreement.  Nevertheless, the threat of a court case on the issue has been successfully used by companies to renegotiate deals, and experts said that some concessions from Yahoo are likely, given the magnitude of the cyber security breaches. Renegotiating the deal’s price tag would be the simplest but also least likely scenario because the impact of the data breaches will not be apparent for some time, according to Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business.  A more likely concession would be for Yahoo to agree to compensate Verizon after the close of the deal, based on the liabilities that occur. The two companies may also agree to extend the close of the deal to allow for more time for information to come in on the impact of the breaches, Gordon suggested. Verizon shares rose 0.4 percent to close at $51.81, in line with the S&P; 500 Index .SPX. Yahoo closed down 6.1 percent at $38.41.  Yahoo said late on Wednesday that it had uncovered a 2013 cyber attack that compromised data of more than 1 billion user accounts, the largest known breach on record.  It said the data stolen may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers. The company added that some of its partners were affected. One such partner, Europe’s Sky Plc (SKYB.L), said Yahoo provides email services to its 2.1 million Sky.com email account holders, but it was unclear how many of those accounts were affected.  The announcement followed Yahoo’s disclosure in September of a separate breach that affected over 500 million accounts, which the company said it believed was launched by different hackers.  The White House said on Thursday the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation was probing the breach. Several lawsuits seeking class-action status on behalf of Yahoo shareholders have been filed, or are in the works. Meanwhile, Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia said he was looking into Yahoo’s cyber security practices. “This most-recent revelation warrants a separate follow-up and I plan to press the company on why its cyber defenses have been so weak as to have compromised over a billion users,” he said in a statement. Warner, who will become the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee next year, described the hacks as “deeply troubling.”  New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman urged anyone with a Yahoo account to change their passwords and security questions and said he is examining the breach’s circumstances and the company’s disclosures to law enforcement.  Germany’s cyber security authority, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), advised German consumers to consider switching to safer alternatives for email, and criticized Yahoo for failing to adopt modern encryption techniques to protect users’ personal data. “Considering the repeated cases of data theft, users should look more closely at which services they want to use in the future and security should play a part in that decision,” BSI President Arne Schoenbohm said in a statement. The latest breach drew widespread criticism from security experts, several advising consumers to close their Yahoo accounts. “Yahoo has fallen down on security in so many ways I have to recommend that if you have an active Yahoo email account, either direct with Yahoo of via a partner like AT&T;, get rid of it,” Stu Sjouwerman, chief executive of cyber security firm KnowBe4 Inc, said in a broadly distributed email.  A Yahoo spokesperson, in response to criticism of the company’s security measures, said on Thursday: “We’re committed to keeping our users secure, both by continuously striving to stay ahead of ever-evolving online threats and to keep our users and platforms secure.”  ",12162016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-yahoo-cyber/yahoo-under-scrutiny-after-latest-hack-verizon-seeks-new-deal-terms-idUSKBN14420S
1215,VZ,Verizon executive says company unsure about Yahoo deal,"(Reuters) - A senior Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) executive said on Thursday that the company was unsure about its planned acquisition of Yahoo Inc’s YHOO.O internet business. Yahoo came under renewed scrutiny by federal investigators and lawmakers last month after disclosing the largest known data breach in history, prompting Verizon to demand better terms for its planned purchase.     “I can’t sit here today and say with confidence one way or another because we still don’t know,” Marni Walden, president of product innovation and new businesses at Verizon, said at the Citi 2017 Internet, Media & Telecommunications Conference in Las Vegas. Walden added that the merits of the deal still made sense and that there were certain aspects of the investigation that had yet to be completed. She did not provide a time-frame for the completion of the deal. “We think it will take weeks at least, we don’t have a desire to have it drag on forever, that’s not our intent,” Walden said. However, AOL Chief Executive Tim Armstrong told CNBC that he expected the Verizon-Yahoo deal would likely go through. AOL was acquired by Verizon in 2015 for $4.4 billion. cnb.cx/2iUh4pX Yahoo’s shares were up 3.09 percent at $41.30, while Verizon’s shares were relatively unchanged in late afternoon trading.

1219,VZ,"UPDATE 2-Straight Path settles U.S. license investigation, shares jump","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Straight Path Communications Inc STRP.A said on Thursday it would pay $15 million to settle a federal probe of claims that the wireless spectrum owner had submitted false data to renew airwave licenses, sparking a 30 percent rally in its stock. The airwaves can be used for emerging 5G wireless technology, which service providers such as AT&T; Inc (T.N) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) are seeking to expand their networks. As part of the settlement, Straight Path will also pay a 20 percent cut of any sale of its licenses, the company said in a statement. The commission investigated Straight Path’s former parent, IDT Corp (IDT.N), and its spectrum licenses following allegations of fraud in November 2015 by an anonymous short seller of the company’s stock. Short sellers borrow securities to sell in the belief that they can buy back them back later at a lower price. The short seller claimed that Straight Path managed to renew its 39 GHz band licenses by incorrectly saying in its filings that it had constructed systems that were never built. Short sellers such as New York-based Kerrisdale, a $400 million hedge fund, announced in late 2015 they were targeting Straight Path’s stock, leading to wild swings from $50 to less than $8 over several months. The stock closed $9.72 higher at $31.13 on Thursday. Under the settlement, if Straight Path does not announce the sale of its spectrum licenses in the next 12 months, it will have to pay the Treasury Department $85 million or return its licenses. It also agreed to surrender 196 of its 1,000 licenses in the 39 GHz band. Travis LeBlanc, chief of the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau, said in a statement that “squatting on spectrum licenses” was “fundamentally inconsistent with the public good.”  In July 2016, the FCC made a rule change that allowed for the 28GHz and 39GHz bands, a major part of Straight Path’s spectrum holdings, to be used in mobile communications. Straight Path also said on Thursday that it was hiring investment bank Evercore Partners Inc (EVR.N) to help the company explore strategic alternatives, including a sale of its assets.

1220,VZ,Straight Path settles with FCC over licenses,"SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Straight Path Communications Inc, a holder of licenses to wireless spectrum, said it has settled with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, resolving an investigation into the company. As part of the settlement, Straight Path will pay $15 million to the FCC and give the regulator a 20 percent cut of any sale of its spectrum licenses, the company said in a statement on Thursday. The FCC had made inquiries into Straight Path’s former parent company IDT Corp and its spectrum licenses following allegations of fraud that were made against the company by an anonymous shortseller. Straight Path’s main asset is its licenses for airwaves that could be used by wireless operators in emerging 5G technology. Wireless providers such as AT&T; Inc and Verizon Communications Inc are hungry for airwaves to help them expand their networks. In July 2016, the FCC made a rule change that allowed for the 28GHz and 39GHz bands, a major part of Straight Path’s spectrum holdings, to be used in mobile communications. Straight Path is also hiring investment bank Evercore Partners Inc to help the company explore strategic alternatives. As part of the consent decree, if Straight Path does not announce the sale of its spectrum licenses in the next 12 months, it will have to pay the FCC $85 million or return its licenses. “We are pleased that we were able to achieve a comprehensive settlement with the FCC, which allows us to move forward,” Chief Executive Davidi Jonas said in the statement. The settlement may put an end to some of the uncertainty surrounding the company, whose stock seesawed in late 2015 from $50 to less than $8. Besides the anonymous shortseller, it had also been targeted by New York-based Kerrisdale, a $400 million hedge fund that shorts stocks publicly.

1222,VZ,Outgoing FCC chair warns against overturning net neutrality,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Outgoing U.S. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler warned Republicans against dismantling the Obama administration’s landmark “net neutrality” protections that bar internet service providers from slowing consumer access to web content. Wheeler, in an interview this week, repeatedly questioned why Republicans would institute new policies that he said would benefit major internet service providers such as Comcast Corp, AT&T; Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and CenturyLink Inc at the expense of thousands of other companies and consumers. The FCC rules set in early 2015 prohibit broadband providers from giving or selling access to speedy internet, essentially a “fast lane” on the web’s information superhighway, to certain internet services over others. “These are serious things,” said Wheeler, who steps down Friday as Republican Donald Trump replaces Democrat Barack Obama as president. “People have made business decisions based on the expectation of an open internet and to take that away in order to favor half a dozen companies just seems to be a shocking decision. “There are a half a dozen ISPs (internet service providers) and tens of thousands of companies and millions of consumers who would be affected.” Republican FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai, who is expected to be named acting chairman by Trump as early as Friday, said in December he thought net neutrality’s days were numbered. He said the commission should take a “weed whacker” to unneeded rules. Wheeler, a former cable and wireless industry lobbyist,  questioned why Republicans would abandon conservative economic principles “to favor a half dozen companies.” “I can certainly understand why the ISPs for their own corporate interests would want to have no oversight at all and they certainly are advocating that position right now,” he said. Wheeler said companies already are flaunting the rules by offering free or sponsored data services for some products. He said in a letter earlier this month that AT&T; and Verizon’s programs “present significant risks to consumers and competition.” The companies both defended the programs. Under Wheeler, the FCC in October decided to impose stricter privacy rules on ISPs than those imposed on websites like Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc’s Google or Twitter Inc. The Republican-controlled FCC is also likely to overturn those rules. Internet providers fear net neutrality rules make it harder to manage internet traffic and make investment in additional capacity less likely. The Republican-controlled Congress is also considering rewriting the net neutrality rules. Some critics and companies suggested Wheeler favored Google and other tech companies during his tenure. [nL1N1DI15Q] Wheeler disputed that and said the FCC did not have jurisdiction over websites. Wheeler suffered some setbacks late in his term. The FCC did not approve his proposal to open the $20 billion market for rented pay-TV set-top boxes. That measure would have dealt a big blow to cable companies and created an opening for firms such as Google and Apple Inc. Wheeler tweeted a farewell Friday morning: “Upon my FCC departure, I would like to sign off with 3 words of wisdom that guided me well: competition, competition, competition.” ",1202017,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fcc-internet/outgoing-fcc-chair-warns-against-overturning-net-neutrality-idUSL1N1FA0VY

1228,VZ,Verizon reports 5.6 percent fall in quarterly revenue,"Jan 24   (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc, whose deal to buy Yahoo Inc’s core assets has been cast into doubt by data breaches at the internet company, reported a 5.6 percent fall in quarterly revenue on Tuesday as it struggles to fend off rivals in a maturing U.S. wireless market. Verizon added a net 591,000 retail postpaid subscribers - those who pay their bills on a monthly basis - in the fourth-quarter ended Dec. 31, far fewer than the 726,00 analysts  had expected, according to market research firm FactSet StreetAccount. Verizon’s operating revenue fell for the third straight quarter, to $32.34 billion, from $34.25 billion in the same period of 2015. Talk that Verizon may demand for better terms from Yahoo intensified in December after the internet pioneer disclosed that a breach in 2013 had exposed data from more than 1 billion user accounts. Yahoo said in September another breach in 2014 had compromised the accounts of more than 500 million users. Taking into account the two breaches, Yahoo said on Monday that its deal with Verizon was expected to wrap up in the second quarter instead of the first quarter, putting to rest some investor concerns about the deal’s future. Verizon said on Tuesday it continued to work with Yahoo to assess the impact of data breaches.

1231,VZ,"Speculation builds on a Verizon-Charter tie-up, no offer made","(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc	is interested in exploring a combination with U.S. cable company Charter Communication Inc as part of a long list of acquisition targets, but no proposal has been made for a tie-up between the two companies, sources told Reuters on Thursday.    Speculation over a combination of the companies underscores the pressure the nation’s largest wireless carrier faces to do a deal in the wake of AT&T; Inc’s planned $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner Inc. Verizon and other carriers also face a saturated smartphone market. Verizon said in July that it struck a deal to buy Yahoo Inc’s core internet properties, but the deal was cast into doubt after Yahoo disclosed data breaches last year.  “I think the market is predictably impatient and wants Verizon to do something yesterday,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. “The market inevitably draws the comparison to AT&T; that, for better or worse, has made its big strategic bet.”  After rising as much as 10 percent and hitting a session high of $341.50 on the news, Charter shares eased and were trading up 6.5 percent at $330.59. Verizon shares were down 1.4 percent at $49.08. Charter and Verizon declined to comment.     A Charter acquisition would signal that Verizon has a drastically different strategic vision than rival AT&T;, which has sought to diversify away from the wireless business through its deal for Time Warner and earlier acquisition of satellite-TV provider DirecTV. Instead, a deal for Charter would indicate Verizon is betting on infrastructure. On its earnings conference call with investors on Tuesday, Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis said that 5G wireless technology was a focus for Verizon. “The great irony could be that the cable operators are better positioned to compete in 5G wireless than the wireless operators themselves,” Moffett said. Speculation over a tie-up with Charter has been building steadily since last month when Verizon Chief Executive Officer Lowell McAdam told Wall Street analysts that such a deal would make “industrial sense,” according to a December note by BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk.   With Charter, Verizon would gain a fiber and cable network across 49 million homes, including markets in California, Texas, and Florida, that the wireless carrier recently divested to Frontier Communications Corp, JPMorgan analysts said in a note in December.  From a traditional antitrust point of view, the combination of a phone company and a cable company would not raise competition issues that cannot be overcome, said George Bittlingmayer, a professor at the University of Kansas School of Business.  “The wildcard here is whether people’s unhappiness with their cable and mobile phone providers would translate into some grandstanding and arm-twisting on the part of the new administration for political benefit,” he said.     Phil Cusick, an analyst at JPMorgan, said in an email on Thursday that he expects $2 billion in annual synergies from a Charter deal but added that the deal’s math is “difficult to make work,” noting that a combined company would be heavily leveraged.  The Wall Street Journal, which first reported a preliminary approach between the companies, said it was unclear if Charter’s executives would be open to a transaction and that there was no guarantee a deal would be struck.

1237,VZ,Verizon bondholders want more in debt exchange after M&A; rumors,"NEW YORK, Jan 27 (IFR) - Holders of Verizon Communications debt are pushing the company to amend terms on an exchange offer for nearly US$30bn of debt following reports that it could buy cable operator Charter Communications. Bondholders are concerned that Verizon’s credit rating could be downgraded if it issues new debt in order to acquire Charter, making the new bonds riskier, buyside sources told IFR on Friday. On Wednesday, investors were offered the chance to exchange up to 18 existing Verizon bonds for new bonds with longer maturities. It may also exchange some bonds for cash. “People would be taking their maturities longer with this trade and a large acquisition would add uncertainty to the picture,” said one investor looking at the exchange. “We are always subject to the possibility of big acquisitions, but the proximity of it is kind of unique here.” The exchange offer closes at 5pm New York time on Tuesday, giving bondholders a short window to push for better terms to account for the potential changes to Verizon’s balance sheet. The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Verizon, which has a market cap of US$194bn, was exploring a possible transaction with Charter, which is worth US$80bn. Verizon has over US$100bn in outstanding debt. In its Q4 earnings report this week, the company reaffirmed its goal of single-A ratings by 2018-2019. It is currently rated BBB+ by S&P;, Baa1 by Moody’s and A- by Fitch. Coupon step-ups would be the best solution to guard against the risk of Verizon’s credit rating being downgraded because of the acquisition, the investors said. “We are talking to the dealer and the company and seeking to have step-up language inserted,” said a second investor. The company could also offer higher premiums in the exchange or extend the deadline for participation, said a third investor.

1241,VZ,"New York sues Charter, alleges Time Warner fraud on internet speeds","NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York filed a lawsuit on Wednesday accusing Charter Communications Inc of short-changing customers who were promised faster internet speeds than it could deliver. The lawsuit in State Supreme Court in Manhattan accused Charter’s Spectrum unit, until recently known as Time Warner Cable, of systematically defrauding customers since 2012 by promising and charging for services it knew it could not offer. At least 640,000 subscribers signed up for high-speed plans but got slower speeds, and many subscribers were unable to access promised online content such as Facebook, Netflix, YouTube and various gaming platforms, the complaint said. The lawsuit seeks “full restitution” for customers, as well as hefty civil fines. In a press conference, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said his office filed the lawsuit after fielding thousands of complaints from unhappy customers. “The allegations in today’s lawsuits confirm what many of you have long suspected,” he said. “Spectrum-Time Warner has been ripping you off.” Charter bought Time Warner Cable last year. In a statement, Charter said it was disappointed that the attorney general challenged Time Warner Cable’s broadband speed advertisements that predated the merger. “We will continue to invest in our business and deliver the highest quality services to our customers while we defend against these allegations involving Time Warner Cable practices,” the Stamford, Connecticut-based company said. Among the allegations in the complaint was an accusation that Time Warner Cable leased older-generation modems to 900,000 subscribers knowing that the modems could not achieve faster internet speeds.

1243,VZ,NY court approves Verizon settlement over 'merger tax' objections,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York state appeals court on Thursday said its door remains open for settlements of merger litigation where shareholders receive no money, approving an accord tied to Verizon Communications Inc’s $130 billion buyout of Vodafone Group Plc’s stake in their Verizon Wireless venture. The Appellate Division, First Department in Manhattan said a lower court judge erred in rejecting a class-action settlement requiring Verizon to disclose more information to shareholders who thought it overpaid, and get a “fairness opinion” if it sold some of the venture’s assets. It also entitled the shareholders’ lawyers to up to $2 million for fees and expenses. “Disclosure-only” settlements have lost favor in recent years, with critics saying they provide little benefit to shareholders and companies, while forcing companies to pay fees of shareholders’ lawyers in a so-called “merger tax.” Judges in Delaware courts routinely approved such settlements for many years but have in recent decisions made clear those days are over, causing lawyers to file dozens of merger-related lawsuits in other courts instead. The Verizon settlement drew objections from two shareholders, and was rejected in December 2014 by New York State Supreme Court Justice Melvin Schweitzer. He said the accord failed to materially boost shareholder knowledge about the merger, which had closed in February 2014, and could impede the New York-based phone company’s ability to sell assets. But in Thursday’s decision, a four-judge appellate division panel said the added disclosures provided at least “some benefit” to shareholders, while the fairness opinion requirement could help insure good prices for asset sales. The panel also tightened its nearly 27-year-old test for approving such settlements, adding requirements that they be in shareholders’ and companies’ best interests. It said the Verizon settlement achieved both. “Given the changing circumstances and concerns surrounding nonmonetary settlements of class actions,” the Verizon case offered an opportunity “to address present day concerns,” Justice Marcy Kahn wrote. The appellate division returned the case to the lower court to determine legal fees. “We are pleased,” Juan Monteverde, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an email. “Litigation that provides enhanced corporate disclosures and corporate governance will continue to play a vital role in protecting public shareholders.” A lawyer for one of the objecting shareholders did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The other objector, Gerald Walpin, a former inspector general under President George W. Bush, died last year. The case is Gordon et al v.

It also entitled the shareholders’ lawyers to up to $2 million for fees and expenses. “Disclosure-only” settlements have lost favor in recent years, with critics saying they provide little benefit to shareholders and companies, while forcing companies to pay fees of shareholders’ lawyers in a so-called “merger tax.” Judges in Delaware courts routinely approved such settlements for many years but have in recent decisions made clear those days are over, causing lawyers to file dozens of merger-related lawsuits in other courts instead. The Verizon settlement drew objections from two shareholders, and was rejected in December 2014 by New York State Supreme Court Justice Melvin Schweitzer. He said the accord failed to materially boost shareholder knowledge about the merger, which had closed in February 2014, and could impede the New York-based phone company’s ability to sell assets. But in Thursday’s decision, a four-judge appellate division panel said the added disclosures provided at least “some benefit” to shareholders, while the fairness opinion requirement could help insure good prices for asset sales. The panel also tightened its nearly 27-year-old test for approving such settlements, adding requirements that they be in shareholders’ and companies’ best interests. It said the Verizon settlement achieved both. “Given the changing circumstances and concerns surrounding nonmonetary settlements of class actions,” the Verizon case offered an opportunity “to address present day concerns,” Justice Marcy Kahn wrote. The appellate division returned the case to the lower court to determine legal fees. “We are pleased,” Juan Monteverde, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an email. “Litigation that provides enhanced corporate disclosures and corporate governance will continue to play a vital role in protecting public shareholders.” A lawyer for one of the objecting shareholders did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The other objector, Gerald Walpin, a former inspector general under President George W. Bush, died last year. The case is Gordon et al v.

1246,VZ,U.S. telecommunications regulator closes 'sponsored data' probe,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. telecommunications regulator said on Friday it was closing inquiries into sponsored data programs and TV services offered by AT&T; Inc, Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), T-Mobile USA Inc (TMUS.O) without taking any action. Under the Obama administration, the Federal Communications Commission had sent letters raising concerns about whether some data practices by AT&T; and Verizon violated net neutrality rules. The FCC had also sent letters to Comcast about its “Stream TV” service and to T-Mobile about its “Binge On” service in 2015. Millions of mobile phone users benefit from free data video services but critics warn that the practice may prod users into avoiding competitors’ services. Net neutrality rules imposed by the FCC in 2015 require broadband providers to treat all data equally and bar service providers from slowing consumer access to web content. Tom Wheeler, who was FCC chairman until Jan. 20, told Reuters last month that its investigation found some free data practices were abusive and anticompetitive. But in an about-face on Friday, the regulator now under Republican control said it was closing its investigation. “These free-data plans have proven to be popular among consumers, particularly low-income Americans, and have enhanced competition in the wireless marketplace,” new FCC chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement. Sponsored or zero-rated free data programs allow mobile phone users free data if they use certain video services. AT&T; phone subscribers can watch DirecTV, which is owned by the company, on their phones without incurring data charges. Verizon also offers mobile phone subscribers some sponsored “go90” video content that does not count against data caps. In a Jan. 11 report, the FCC’s wireless bureau said Binge On did not violate net neutrality rules, but it found concerns with AT&T; and Verizon’s data programs. Pai voted against the net neutrality rules and said last month he thought the regulation’s “days are numbered.”  “It is clear that net neutrality is public enemy number one for Chairman Pai,” Democratic U.S. Senator Edward Markey said on Friday. “He is starting his campaign by protecting harmful zero-rating plans.” Verizon spokesman Rich Young said the company has always believed its free data programs benefit customers. Joan Marsh, an AT&T;’s senior vice president said the decision was a “win for the millions of consumers who are reaping the benefits of services made available through free data programs.” Comcast declined to comment, but has said its “Stream TV” is an IP-based cable service that is not covered by net neutrality rules.

Corrects name of company to T-Mobile US Inc, not T-Mobile USA in paragraph 3.) By Anjali Athavaley NEW YORK, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc’s  announcement that it will once again offer an unlimited pricing plan marks a shift in its thinking as a price war among the four biggest U.S wireless carriers accelerates. The biggest wireless carrier in the U.S. said on Sunday that it will offer an unlimited data plan, its first in more than five years. The plan, priced at $80 a month for unlimited data, talk and text on a single line, is cheaper than AT&T;’s unlimited plan for DirecTV now and U-Verse subscribers but costs more than plans offered by smaller rivals T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp. On Monday, Verizon also said it was offering free smartphones for customers who switched over. T-Mobile shares fell 2.8 percent in early afternoon trading on Nasdaq. AT&T;, Sprint and Verizon shares were down roughly 1 percent on the New York Stock Exchange as investors worried about how a price war would erode margins. Verizon stopped offering unlimited plans in 2011 largely due to concerns about network capacity and a desire to charge more to customers who were heavier users of data, Dave Heger, senior equity analyst at Edward Jones, said in an interview. On an earnings conference call with investors in late January, Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis said the quality of Verizon’s network allowed the company to maintain a premium price, adding that an unlimited plan was “not something we feel the need to do.” “Verizon resisted going back to unlimited if they could,” Heger said. “It became obvious that the market wasn’t going to necessarily allow that.” The move could hurt the industry’s profit margins, putting more pressure on major players to cut costs, analysts said. “As the carrier was the last holdout, the announcement solidifies the industry’s move back to unlimited plans which ultimately constricts growth and elevates the pressure to drive down network costs,” Amir Rozwadowski, an analyst at Barclays, said in a note. But Jennifer Fritzsche, an analyst at Wells Fargo, argued that the move was a “fightback” moment for the company. Verizon said in January that it added fewer subscribers than anticipated in the fourth quarter. Defections among wireless customers who pay bills on a monthly basis increased to 1.10 percent of total wireless subscribers, compared with the average analyst estimate of 1.05 percent, according to FactSet.

President Donald Trump vowed last Thursday to make a major tax announcement in the next few weeks, rekindling a rally that has stalled amid concerns over his protectionist stance and lack of clarity on policy reforms. Financials jumped 1.2 percent, with banks leading the way. The S&P; 500 banks index leaped 1.5 percent. The industrial sector gained 0.84 percent. Financials and industrials are seen benefiting the most, among the 11 major S&P; sectors, from Trump’s policies. The S&P; has surged 8.3 percent since Trump’s Nov. 8 election through Friday’s close, fueled by expectations Trump would lower corporate taxes, reduce regulations and increase infrastructure spending. “At some point there has to be actions that match the words and I think we are getting closer to that point,” said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. Fundamentals also remain robust, with strong economic data in recent weeks supported by upbeat corporate results. S&P; 500 companies are on track for their strongest profit growth in nine quarters, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “What is underlying this whole Trump rhetoric is that fundamentals in the world, including the U.S., are getting better,” Schutte said. At 12:27 p.m. ET (1727 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 128.69 points, or 0.63 percent, at 20,398.06. The Nasdaq Composite was up 28.32 points, or 0.49 percent, at 5,762.45 and the S&P; 500 was up 10.33 points, or 0.44 percent, at 2,326.43. The S&P; has not dropped more than 1 percent since Trump’s election victory. It has gained more than 1 percent on only two occasions, the day after Election Day and on Dec. 7. Among the weak spots were telecom stocks, which dropped 1.04 percent after Verizon’s brought back its unlimited data plan, sparking fears of a price war. Verizon was down 0.98 percent. AT&T; fell 1.1 percent, T-Mobile sank 3 percent, Sprint fell 1.2 percent. Apple was the top stock on the S&P; and the Nasdaq, rising 1.2 percent and closing on its record high. Chemours rose 13 percent after the company and DuPont  agreed to settle lawsuits related to a chemical leak for about $671 million, which Jefferies said was $300 million less than their consensus. DuPont was up about 1 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,704 to 1,165. On the Nasdaq, 1,683 issues rose and 1,120 fell. The S&P; 500 index showed 64 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 166 new highs and 14 new lows.

1253,VZ,Verizon reintroduces unlimited data plan as competition rises,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc will introduce an unlimited data plan on Monday, its first in more than five years, in its latest effort to lure customers as competition rises between network carriers.  The introductory plan, announced on Sunday, will give unlimited data to customers on smartphones and tablets on its 4G LTE network. It comes days after competitor Sprint Corp introduced a new unlimited data plan of its own. The unlimited option appears to be a change in direction for Verizon after one of the company’s top executives said last month it was not looking at unlimited products when asked by analysts whether Verizon needed to be more aggressive in the market.  “We constantly look at... what’s out there. Unlimited is one of the things that some of our competition has at this point in time. That’s not something we feel the need to do,” Matthew Ellis, Verizon’s chief financial officer, told analysts during an earnings call on Jan. 24.  “But as I say, we continually monitor the market and we will see where we head in the future,” he added.  Verizon’s unlimited plan is $80 per month for unlimited data, talk and text for the first line with paper-free billing and autopay, and $45 per line for four lines. The company stopped offering unlimited data plans for most customers in 2011.  (Story corrects pricing in paragraph 6.)

Verizon will combine Yahoo’s advertising technology tools as well as its search, email and messenger assets with its AOL unit, purchased for $4.4 billion in 2015.  Verizon’s shares rose 0.3 percent to $49.33 in afternoon trading, while Yahoo’s shares were up 0.8 percent at $45.48. Under the amended terms, Yahoo and Verizon will split cash liabilities related to some government investigations and third-party litigation related to the breaches. Yahoo, however, will continue to be responsible for liabilities from shareholder lawsuits and SEC investigations. Yahoo said in December that data from more than 1 billion user accounts was compromised in August 2013, making it the largest breach in history. This followed the company’s disclosure in September that at least 500 million accounts were affected in another breach in 2014.

1272,VZ,UPDATE 2-U.S. FCC blocks stricter broadband privacy rules from taking effect,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Wednesday blocked some Obama administration rules on the eve of implementation, regulations that would have subjected broadband providers to stricter scrutiny than web sites face to protect customers’ private data. The reversal by the Trump administration’s U.S. Federal Communications Commission was a victory for internet providers such as AT&T; Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc . The rules aimed to protect personal consumer data. They would have subjected broadband internet service providers to more stringent data security requirements than websites like Facebook Inc, Twitter Inc or Alphabet Inc’s Google unit. The decision will “provide time” for the FCC and the Federal Trade Commission to devise “a comprehensive and consistent framework” to protect online privacy, the agency said in a statement. Internet service providers hailed the decision. Consumer advocates objected. Sena Fitzmaurice, Comcast’s vice president of government communications, called it “a sensible, pro-consumer approach” in which “consumers remain protected by the safeguards in place for the past two years.” AT&T; and Verizon also praised the action. But Laura MacCleery, a vice president at Consumer Reports magazine, called it “a troubling first step towards unraveling critical, pro-consumer online privacy protections.” The rules would have required internet service providers to obtain consumer consent before using precise geo-location, financial information, health information, children’s information and web browsing history for advertising and marketing. For less sensitive information such as email addresses or service tiers, consumers would be able to opt out. MacCleery said the Consumer Reports had “heard from more than 50,000 consumers who support these rules through petitions and comments directly to the FCC.” FCC Chair Ajit Pai and acting FTC Chair Maureen Ohlhausen in a joint statement said they would work to ensure a consistent privacy framework. “After all, Americans care about the overall privacy of their information when they use the internet, and they shouldn’t have to be lawyers or engineers to figure out if their information is protected differently depending on which part of the internet holds it,” they said. “The federal government shouldn’t favor one set of companies over another,” they added. FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, a Democrat, objected in a statement that the agency “should be the ‘cop on the beat’” but instead “is leaving broadband customers without assurances that their providers will keep their data secure.” In October, Republican commissioners including Pai said the rules unfairly gave websites the ability to harvest more data than service providers and dominate digital advertising.

1280,VZ,Exclusive: Ligado Networks hires banks to explore options - sources,"(Reuters) - Ligado Networks, the wireless satellite venture formerly known as LightSquared Inc that emerged from bankruptcy in 2015, is working with financial advisers to explore strategic alternatives, according to people familiar with the matter.  The Reston, Virginia-based company has hired investment banks Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and PJT Partners Inc PJT.T for its review, which will consider a potential sale or new investment among several options, the people said on Monday.  Another possibility under consideration is finding a new equity investor through a private placement, the people added, asking not to be identified because the matter is not public. Representatives for Ligado, Goldman Sachs and PJT declined to comment.  Ligado’s move to explore options comes as the company awaits approval from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allow it to use a portion of wireless airwaves in the so-called mid-band, which are spectrum frequencies that the company has said will help the telecom industry adopt 5G networks.  5G technology promises to be ten times to 100 times faster than current speeds. A spectrum crunch in the United States has driven up demand for these assets, as wireless providers such as AT&T; Inc (T.N) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) are hungry for airwaves to help them expand their networks. Ligado’s efforts to attract a new investment may be stymied by its large debt load, and uncertainty over the FCC’s approval for some of its wireless airwaves, according to the sources. Ligado exited bankruptcy in December 2015 with $1.5 billion in senior debt and $2.9 billion in junior debt, according to bankruptcy court documents.   The company’s junior debt has recently been trading well below face value, at about 79 cents on the dollar, according to Thomson Reuters data, indicating investor concerns about full repayment. Fortress Investment Group LLC FIG.N, Centerbridge Partners LP and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) control Ligado after winning it in bankruptcy. Backed by hedge fund manager Philip Falcone, LightSquared originally planned to build a nationwide wireless network when the FCC proposed to suspend its plans in 2012, saying that the network it was building interfered with global positioning systems (GPS), included ones used by the military. This pushed it into bankruptcy in May 2012. It has since reached agreements with some of the GPS makers. Financial advisers for Ligado pegged the company’s spectrum as worth between $4.5 billion and $6.8 billion during the bankruptcy, based on a certain method of valuing that type of asset, according to bankruptcy court papers.

1287,VZ,"Verizon, AT&T; suspend ads from Google over offensive videos","(Reuters) - U.S. wireless carriers Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and AT&T; Inc (T.N) said on Wednesday they have suspended digital advertising on Google’s YouTube and other advertising platforms not related to search over concerns that their ads may have run next to extremist videos.  Verizon and AT&T; joined a list of well-known British brands such as retailer Marks and Spencer Group Plc (MKS.L) deserting Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google. Google is under fire in Europe from politicians and brands angered by ads appearing alongside videos on its YouTube platform carrying homophobic or anti-Semitic messages.  Google on Tuesday vowed an overhaul of its practices. The company must act swiftly to ensure that more advertisers do not pile on, analysts say.  As advertisers revolt, the search giant faces both a short-term loss of revenue and a long-term danger that companies will lose faith in the automated placement of ads upon which Google has built its empire, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research.  “The bigger risk is this seems to be a backlash against programmatic advertising in general,” Dawson said. “There’s this worry that you no longer have control over where ads appear.”   AT&T; is removing ads from the non-search inventory on Google because its “ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate,” the company wrote in an email. Verizon said it had suspended all digital advertising not related to search after saying earlier on Wednesday that it had only suspended advertising on Google’s non-search platforms. It took the action after its ads were appearing on “non-sanctioned websites,” a spokeswoman wrote in an email.  “We are working with all of our digital advertising partners to understand the weak links so we can prevent this from happening in the future,” the spokeswoman said.  Google declined to comment on individual customers but said it has begun a review of its advertising policies. The news that AT&T; and Verizon were suspending Google ads was first reported by Britain’s Times newspaper. Other big brands, such as Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), were keeping an eye on the situation. While Mondelez has not seen evidence that its ads have appeared alongside inappropriate content, it is in “constant discussion with both Google and YouTube and will be monitoring the issue closely,” a spokeswoman said. YouTube has been a key driver of growth for Google as its traditional business of search advertising matures. Google’s net ad revenue worldwide from YouTube was $5.58 billion last year, according to New York-based research firm eMarketer. It is expected to hit $7 billion in 2017, according to a forecast by eMarketer made before the recent controversy. One question many people are asking is whether advertisers will reallocate the marketing dollars they have devoted to YouTube to other platforms, said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research. Wieser, however, thinks that if the boycott is widespread enough, no one else will benefit.  “If you know all of your competitors are reducing their spending too, then you don’t need to spend more,” he said. Google must walk a fine line between giving advertisers more control and alienating the massive community of content creators who have made the site a top destination for coveted young viewers. One likely path forward for Google is to tighten controls on which videos are eligible for advertising, perhaps by the channel’s track record or number of viewers, said Dawson. But any such restrictions risk hurting artists with small followings.  “Google is caught between a rock and a hard place here between its creators and its advertisers,” Dawson said.

Verizon said it had suspended all digital advertising not related to search after saying earlier on Wednesday that it had only suspended advertising on Google’s non-search platforms. It took the action after its ads were appearing on “non-sanctioned websites,” a spokeswoman wrote in an email.  “We are working with all of our digital advertising partners to understand the weak links so we can prevent this from happening in the future,” the spokeswoman said.  Google declined to comment on individual customers but said it has begun a review of its advertising policies. The news that AT&T; and Verizon were suspending Google ads was first reported by Britain’s Times newspaper. Other big brands, such as Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), were keeping an eye on the situation. While Mondelez has not seen evidence that its ads have appeared alongside inappropriate content, it is in “constant discussion with both Google and YouTube and will be monitoring the issue closely,” a spokeswoman said. YouTube has been a key driver of growth for Google as its traditional business of search advertising matures. Google’s net ad revenue worldwide from YouTube was $5.58 billion last year, according to New York-based research firm eMarketer. It is expected to hit $7 billion in 2017, according to a forecast by eMarketer made before the recent controversy. One question many people are asking is whether advertisers will reallocate the marketing dollars they have devoted to YouTube to other platforms, said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research. Wieser, however, thinks that if the boycott is widespread enough, no one else will benefit.  “If you know all of your competitors are reducing their spending too, then you don’t need to spend more,” he said. Google must walk a fine line between giving advertisers more control and alienating the massive community of content creators who have made the site a top destination for coveted young viewers. One likely path forward for Google is to tighten controls on which videos are eligible for advertising, perhaps by the channel’s track record or number of viewers, said Dawson. But any such restrictions risk hurting artists with small followings.  “Google is caught between a rock and a hard place here between its creators and its advertisers,” Dawson said.

1294,VZ,Fitch Rates American Tower's EUR500MM Debt Offering 'BBB'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 30 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to American Tower Corporation's (AMT) offering of EUR500 million senior unsecured notes due 2025. Net proceeds from the offering will be used to repay existing debt on its 2013 revolving credit facility (RCF). Proceeds may also be used for general corporate purposes. As of Dec. 31, 2016, pro forma outstanding borrowings on AMT's 2013 RCF totaled approximately $1.7 billion. The pro forma amount reflects borrowings to fund a portion of the FPS Towers' acquisition and the repayment of debt, including the repayment in their entirety of the GTP cellular sites and Unison notes, the redemption of the 7.25% senior unsecured notes due 2019, and repayment of a portion of the 2014 RCF. AMT has a Fitch Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'BBB' with a Stable Rating Outlook. KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong Free Cash Flow (FCF) and Margins: AMT's ratings are supported by the financial flexibility provided by its strong FCF and its high EBITDA margin, which has been consistently around 60% in recent years. The tower business model translates into strong, sustainable operating performance and FCF growth, aided by the company's significant scale and the favorable demand characteristics for wireless services (particularly data). Stable Growth Model: AMT is expected to continue to post strong FCF, generate mid- to high-single-digit organic growth and maintain relatively stable margins. Tower revenues are predictable, and growth is provided by contractual escalators embodied in long-term lease contracts and there are strong prospects for additional business. The tower industry is benefiting from wireless carriers continued investment in their fourth generation (4G) networks to meet rapidly growing demand for mobile broadband services. Stable Outlook: Fitch expects AMT's net leverage to be under 5.0x at the end of 2017. Leverage is currently elevated primarily as a result of AMT's acquisitions, including the acquisition of the rights to towers and outright purchases of towers from Verizon Communications Inc. in 2015. Consolidation Risk Manageable: Fitch believes U.S. wireless consolidation, if it were to occur, would not have a material effect on AMT's operations. Revenue growth from continued lease activity and contractual escalators in the U.S market would more than offset the relatively modest losses occurring over time due to consolidation. International Exposure: Similar wireless service demand trends are occurring internationally, with wireless data services at an earlier stage of development than in the U.S. Excluding pass-through revenues, the company's international operations generated approximately 35% of total property revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --In 2017, consolidated revenue grows to slightly less than $6.5 billion, based on expectations for property revenue to be near the mid-point of company guidance of $6.4 billion. In 2018 and thereafter, Fitch assumes revenue grows in the 4%-5% range due to contractual escalators and new-business growth. --EBITDA margins decline slightly in 2017 due to the lower margins associated with acquired properties, but increase moderately thereafter as additional tenants are added to towers. --Capital spending of approximately $850 million in 2017. --Moderate stock repurchases as net leverage under 5x is reached, with further deleveraging arising from EBITDA growth (rather than debt repayment). RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: At the current 'BBB' level, Fitch does not currently anticipate near-term developments that could lead to an upgrade of the rating. Negative: A negative rating action could occur if operating performance falls short of expectations of at least mid-single-digit organic growth combined with margin pressure, or if a significant transaction, or share repurchases, results in expectations for net leverage sustained above 5x for longer than an 18-24 month period. LIQUIDITY In Fitch's opinion, AMT has a strong liquidity position supported by its FCF, cash on hand and availability on its revolving credit facilities. Operationally, cash flow generation should remain strong. For 2016, FCF (cash provided by operating activities less capital spending and dividends) was approximately $1 billion. As of Dec. 31, 2016, cash approximated $787 million and unused revolver capacity was approximately $2.8 billion. Of the cash balance, approximately $423 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. AMT has two revolving credit facilities: a $2 billion, multi-currency facility due in January 2022 (the 2014 RCF) and a $2.75 billion revolving credit facility due in June 2020 (the 2013 RCF). The principal financial covenants limited total debt/adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the agreements) to no more than 6.0x (up to 7.0x for specified time periods following a qualified acquisition). The covenants limit senior secured debt/adjusted EBITDA to 3.0x for the company and its subsidiaries. If debt ratings are below a specified level at the end of any fiscal quarter, the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to interest expense must be no less than 2.5x for as long as the ratings are below the specified level. Debt maturities consist of approximately $238 million and $1.6 billion in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Contact: Primary Analyst John C.

1295,VZ,"Verizon hires ex-Ericsson CEO, sets new operating structure","(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) said on Friday that Hans Vestberg, the former Ericsson chief executive officer, has joined the company and will lead a team building out its fiber network infrastructures amid growing competition from smaller rivals. “It shows with Vestberg that they want to go back to having that network superiority, which has been increasingly eroded,” said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics.  The move also sets up Vestberg, 51, as a potential successor to Verizon Chief Executive Officer Lowell McAdam, he said. The No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier said Vestberg will initially be based in Sweden but join the U.S.-based team later this spring.   “What bringing someone in for the outside means is you need a new perspective,” Entner said. Verizon also said it is restructuring operations into three areas including Vestberg’s team. The media and telematics unit will focus on new businesses in digital media, including integrating its pending acquisition of Yahoo Inc YHOO.O. It will be led by Marni Walden as executive vice president for media and telematics. The customer and product operations team, led by John Stratton, will work on operating and growing Verizon’s established businesses, such as Verizon Wireless and Verizon Enterprise Solutions.

1299,VZ,U.S. FCC chairman plans fast-track repeal of net neutrality: sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission is moving quickly to replace the Obama administration’s landmark net neutrality rules and wants internet service providers to voluntarily agree to maintain an open internet, three sources briefed on the meeting said Thursday. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump, met on Tuesday with major telecommunications trade groups to discuss his preliminary plan to reverse the rules, the sources said. The FCC declined to comment but Pai previously said he is committed to ensuring an open internet but feels net neutrality was a mistake. The rules approved by the FCC under Democratic President Barack Obama in early 2015 prohibited broadband providers from giving or selling access to speedy internet, essentially a “fast lane”, to certain internet services over others. As part of that change, the FCC reclassified internet service providers much like utilities. Pai wants to overturn that reclassification, but wants internet providers to voluntarily agree to not obstruct or slow consumer access to web content, two officials said late Tuesday. The officials briefed on the meeting said Pai suggested companies commit in writing to open internet principles and including them in their terms of service, which would make them binding. It is unclear if regulators could legally compel internet providers to adopt open internet principles without existing net neutrality rules. As part of that move, the Federal Trade Commission would assume oversight of ensuring compliance. Three sources said Pai plans to unveil his proposal to overturn the rules as early as late April and it could face an initial vote in May or June.  Internet providers like AT&T; Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Comcast Corp have argued net neutrality rules would make it harder to manage internet traffic and investment in additional capacity less likely.

1302,VZ,"UPDATE 3-T-Mobile, Dish bid combined $14 bln in U.S. airwaves auction -FCC","NEW YORK (Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) bid $8 billion and Dish Network Corp (DISH.O) $6.2 billion to win the bulk of broadcast airwaves spectrum for sale in a government auction, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission said on Thursday. The two carriers accounted for most of the $19.8 billion in winning bids, the FCC said. Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) agreed to acquire $1.7 billion in spectrum, AT&T; Inc (T.N) bid $910 million and investment firm Columbia Capital offered $1 billion. The FCC said 175 broadcast stations were selling airwaves to 50 wireless and other telecommunications companies. Companies plan to use the spectrum to build new networks or improve existing coverage. The spectrum auction’s end is widely expected to kick off a wave of deal-making in the telecom industry. Until now, companies participating in the auction have been restrained by a quiet period, but that will end after April 27, when down payments are due from auction winners. T-Mobile said its $8 billion winning bid would enable it “to compete in every single corner of he country.” The company, controlled by Deutsche Telekom AG (DTEGn.DE), said the investment will quadruple its low-band holdings. Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and Sprint Corp (S.N) opted not to bid. “What is most interesting to us was (Verizon) was nowhere to be found,” Jennifer Fritzsche, an analyst at Wells Fargo, said in a research note, adding that “we continue to believe Verizon’s interests lay in the higher band spectrum assets.” Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, said in an email that there were three surprises in the results: “Comcast bought less than expected, Dish Network bought more, and Verizon bought nothing at all.” Dish shares fell 2.5 percent to close at $62.38. Comcast, Verizon and AT&T; were down less than 1 percent at market close while T-Mobile rose marginally. Moffett said Dish’s spectrum spending underscored “the growing importance of the company’s valuation as it relates to their spectrum holdings.” Comcast sold spectrum from three of its NBCUniversal owned stations in New York, Philadelphia and Chicago for $481.6 million. The FCC also announced new channel assignments for 957 non-winning stations that must change channels to clear the new wireless airwaves for use. Of the $19.8 billion bid, more than $7 billion will go to reduce the U.S. deficit and $10.05 billion to broadcasters relinquishing spectrum. Up to $1.75 billion will go to  broadcasters that incur costs in changing channels. Sellers had initially sought $86.4 billion for 126 megahertz.

1304,VZ,FCC could announce spectrum results as early as Thursday: industry,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission may announce the winners of the government’s $19.8 billion spectrum auction as early as Thursday, industry officials told Reuters. The broadcast incentive spectrum auction is one of the commission’s most complex and ambitious to date attracting wireless and other telecommunications companies who are buying television airwaves from broadcasters for wireless use. Companies plan to use the spectrum to build new networks or improve existing coverage. An FCC spokesman declined to comment on when the results will be announced. The FCC said last year that 62 bidders made upfront payments to take part, including AT&T; Inc (T.N), Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), Dish Network Corp (DISH.O), T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) - which is controlled by Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE), Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and U.S. Cellular Corp (USM.N). Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner said “it will be interesting to see if T-Mobile will get a nationwide license and how much more on top of that; if Verizon was actually bidding; how much and where Comcast and the other cable guys were bidding/winning (nationwide or just their markets),” in an email on Thursday. BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk said in a 2016 research note he believed Comcast had made an auction deposit of $1.8 billion and AT&T; and T-Mobile each made deposits of more than $2 billion, citing company financial statements. The companies have declined to confirm how much they made in deposits, citing FCC rules. U.S. Cellular said in a securities filing in February it had “submitted bids for a minimum amount of $327 million” in the auction. From the auction closing, a quiet period extends for 10 business days preventing some companies from talking to participants about potential tie-ups or mergers. Of the $19.8 billion being raised to acquire 84 megahertz of spectrum, more than $6 billion will go to reduce the U.S. deficit, more than $10 billion will go to broadcasters that chose to relinquish spectrum rights, and up to $1.75 billion for other broadcasters that incur costs in changing channels. In June, the FCC said sellers had initially sought $86.4 billion for 126 megahertz. Many analysts had expected broadcasters to earn substantially more. In February, Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s Fox Television unit (FOXA.O) said it would receive about $350 million in proceeds from spectrum sales. Tribune Media Co (TRCO.N) said it expected $190 million in proceeds from the auction. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in February “these low-band airwaves will improve wireless coverage across the country.” The spectrum will transition over 39 months. Some stations will transition to a new band and a new channel, while others will move off-air. Those going off the air must give at least 30 days notice.

1306,VZ,UPDATE 2-Verizon considering topping AT&T;'s bid for Straight Path -sources,"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) is considering making a buyout offer for Straight Path Communications Inc STRP.A which would top AT&T; Inc’s (T.N) $1.25 billion bid, people familiar with the matter said. Shares of Straight Path, a holder of wireless spectrum licenses sought after by service providers like Verizon and AT&T;, rose 9.4 percent to $100.03 in after-market trading. Straight Path said in a regulatory filing on Thursday that a third party, which it did not name, was evaluating making an offer that would top AT&T;'s bid. (bit.ly/2pc8Nn0) The party had also been bidding to acquire the company before AT&T; made its offer, Straight Path said. Verizon declined to comment on what it called rumors and speculation. AT&T; did not immediately respond to requests for comment and Straight Path declined to comment. Straight Path on Monday agreed to be acquired by AT&T;, the No. 2 U.S. wireless carrier, for $95.63 per share. The price represented a hefty 162.1 percent premium to Straight Path’s April 7 closing price. The wireless spectrum held by Straight Path is expected to play a large role in the latest 5G networks. Both AT&T; and bigger rival Verizon have been conducting 5G trials. Verizon is testing a 5G fixed wireless service with equipment maker Ericsson in 11 markets in the United States and expects a commercial launch as early as 2018. Separately, AT&T; had made a $910 million bid in the broadcast airwaves spectrum sale in a government auction on Thursday, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission said, while Verizon opted not to bid. Straight Path said in January it was hiring investment bank Evercore Partners to help explore strategic alternatives, including a sale of assets. Shares of AT&T; and Verizon were unchanged in extended trading.

1316,VZ,"Verizon profit, revenue miss Wall Street view as subscribers dash","(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) on Thursday reported its first-ever quarterly loss of subscribers, even as it offered an unlimited data plan, raising questions on whether the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier may need a larger acquisition than Yahoo to diversify its business.  Verizon has been struggling to fend off smaller rivals T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) and Sprint Corp (S.N) in a maturing market for U.S. wireless service, and in February offered an unlimited data plan for the first time in more than five years.  While it has pursued other revenue streams, including a $4.48 billion deal for Yahoo Inc's YHOO.O core business, analysts have questioned if it should pursue a more transformative combination.  “We continue to believe that the company needs a strategic transaction to support their wireless business for the long-term,” analysts at New Street Research said in a note.  Meanwhile, Verizon’s main competitor AT&T Inc (T.N) plans to diversify its business through an $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), which would give it control of cable TV channels like HBO and other coveted media assets.  Verizon’s shares were down 1.2 percent at $48.33 in midday trade.  Earlier this week, Verizon Chief Executive Lowell McAdam said in an interview with Bloomberg News that he is open to deal talks with companies ranging from Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) to Walt Disney Co (DIS.N).  On Thursday, Chief Financial Officer Matthew Ellis clarified the comments, saying that while the company would consider deals that are in the interest of shareholders, it is confident in its assets.  “The ecosystem is constantly changing, and if there’s somebody who comes to us with an idea of how we can kind of leapfrog forward in that environment, we’re going to listen to them,” Ellis said in an interview with Reuters. But he added, “We are very confident with the strategy that we have.”  In the first quarter, Verizon said it lost 307,000 retail postpaid subscribers or those who pay a monthly bill. Analysts on average were expecting net additions of 222,000, according to market research firm FactSet StreetAccount.  Churn, or customer defections, among wireless retail customers who pay bills on a monthly basis, increased to 1.15 percent of total wireless subscribers, compared with the average analyst estimate of 1.03 percent, according to FactSet.  Ellis noted that churn rose in the first half of the quarter but came down in response to the relaunch of unlimited plans. “It really was a tale of two halves,” he said.  But analysts viewed the results as disappointing.  “They badly missed on every important subscriber metric, and it just underscores that the wireless business is a severely growth-challenged business at the moment,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson in an interview.Net income attributable to Verizon fell to $3.45 billion, or 84 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $4.31 billion, or $1.06 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, earnings per share was 95 cents.  Total operating revenue fell to $29.81 billion from $32.17 billion a year earlier.  According to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, analysts had expected adjusted earnings per share of 99 cents and revenue of $30.77 billion.

1317,VZ,Verizon's M&A; signal comes in a little clearer,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Verizon’s M&A; signal is starting to come in a little clearer. The U.S. telecommunications titan reported a 20 percent drop in quarterly profit as a new sales initiative failed to attract customers. Its strategy behind buying AOL and Yahoo is perplexing. All of it probably helps explain why Chief Executive Lowell McAdam just indicated he’s open to the idea of a bigger deal. Price wars in the maturing smartphone market – more than 80 percent of Americans already have one – are taking their toll. Verizon’s surprise decision to reverse a six-year-old policy against unlimited data plans didn’t work. Despite rolling out the offer in mid-February, the company lost monthly mobile subscribers – some 300,000 of them – on a net basis for the first time. More worrisome is cash flow from operations, which tumbled to $1.7 billion in the first quarter from $7.5 billion a year ago. A pension contribution accounts for some of the decline. Capital expenditure, however, was essentially flat, while free cash flow was negative $1.4 billion. Verizon fell short of nearly every expectation on Wall Street. That puts more pressure on $200 billion Verizon to chart a future with something more than just the $9 billion it invested in AOL and Yahoo, which have been curiously rebranded as Oath. Consolidation and competition is expected to pick up. Verizon’s biggest direct rival, AT&T;, is waiting for approval on its $85 billion Time Warner deal. Cable outfit Comcast just entered the wireless market. It’s no wonder McAdam was unusually blunt about a merger of his own. He said he’d consider a variety of pairings and even name-checked Comcast, Walt Disney and CBS during an interview earlier in the week. He didn’t mention cable company Charter or satellite operator Dish Network, which could easily be on the list, too, especially considering the latter’s stockpile of spectrum and the acceleration of data usage. It’s not obvious that any of these combinations would necessarily make financial sense for Verizon, but its own lackluster numbers mean it’s nearly time to make a call.",4202017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-verizon-results-breakingviews/verizons-ma-signal-comes-in-a-little-clearer-idUSKBN17M221

Analysts on average were expecting net additions of 222,000, according to market research firm FactSet StreetAccount.  Churn, or customer defections, among wireless retail customers who pay bills on a monthly basis, increased to 1.15 percent of total wireless subscribers, compared with the average analyst estimate of 1.03 percent, according to FactSet.  Ellis noted that churn rose in the first half of the quarter but came down in response to the relaunch of unlimited plans. “It really was a tale of two halves,” he said.  But analysts viewed the results as disappointing.  “They badly missed on every important subscriber metric, and it just underscores that the wireless business is a severely growth-challenged business at the moment,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson in an interview.Net income attributable to Verizon fell to $3.45 billion, or 84 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $4.31 billion, or $1.06 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, earnings per share was 95 cents.  Total operating revenue fell to $29.81 billion from $32.17 billion a year earlier.  According to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, analysts had expected adjusted earnings per share of 99 cents and revenue of $30.77 billion.

1322,VZ,FCC chairman expected to unveil strategy to reverse net neutrality -sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission is expected to unveil his strategy this week to overturn landmark 2015 net neutrality rules, a move that will kickoff a new battle over the future of the internet. Ajit Pai, who was named chair of the FCC by President Donald Trump in January, will deliver a speech titled “The Future of Internet Regulation” on Wednesday in Washington, the FCC said. Sources said Pai is expected to announce that he will begin the process of taking public comment to repeal the rules approved by the FCC under President Barack Obama in early 2015. The FCC could hold an initial vote on his proposal at the FCC’s May 18 meeting, the sources said. Pai’s office declined to comment. The rules approved by the FCC in 2015 prohibit broadband providers from giving or selling access to speedy internet, essentially a “fast lane,” to certain internet services over others. The 2015 FCC rules reclassified internet service providers much like utilities. A federal appeals court upheld the rules last year. Internet providers like AT&T; Inc (T.N), Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) have argued net neutrality rules make it harder to manage internet traffic and investment in additional capacity less likely. Advocacy group Free Press Chief Executive Craig Aaron said Monday Pai wants to hand over control of the internet to providers “no matter the cost to our economy and democracy.” Pai, who opposed the net neutrality reclassification in 2015, has repeatedly said he backs a “free and open internet” but under a different regulatory scheme. Some analysts have said FCC action to roll back net neutrality rules could put pressure Congress to adopt legislation that clarifies the extent of FCC authority to regulate internet service. FCC Commissioner Mike O’Rielly said on Thursday that Congress should adopt legislation to resolve the issue and determine “whether there should be rules.”      Websites worry that without the rules they might lose access to customers. Democrats and privacy advocates have said net neutrality is crucial to keeping the internet open.    Reuters and other news outlets reported in early April that Pai was moving quickly to replace neutrality rules. Pai told reporters Thursday he has been meeting with major internet companies and trade groups to discuss ways of protecting an open internet.  “There’s common ground here and there’s room for an agreement here,” Pai said. “Going forward we want to make sure that we have a light touch regulatory framework.” It is not clear what alternative legal framework Pai may endorse to guarantee an open internet. The Internet Association, a group representing Facebook Inc (FB.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and others, met with Pai this month and said “the internet industry is uniform in its belief that net neutrality preserves the consumer experience, competition, and innovation online,” according to a letter filed with the FCC.

1323,VZ,Verizon's bid challenges AT&T;'s offer for Straight Path: source,"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) has made an offer for Straight Path Communications Inc STRP.A, topping an earlier bid from AT&T; Inc (T.N), in a move that starts a bidding war for a company holding spectrum used in 5G technology, according to a source familiar with the matter.  Straight Path said on Tuesday it received a $104.64 per-share all-stock buyout offer from a “multi-national telecommunications company”. AT&T; and Straight Path had agreed on a deal at $95.63 per share earlier this month. The source did not want to be named because the matter is confidential. Verizon and Straight Path declined to comment. A Verizon bid for Straight Path would be the latest salvo in the battle between Verizon and AT&T; to gain an edge in the race to develop a fifth-generation network (5G) that would offer faster downloads and boost internet-reliant products such as self-driving cars. “Clearly ultra-high band spectrum is a critical part of both AT&T; and Verizon’s 5G Plans” Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche said in a research note. “We  believe it fair to assume (Verizon) would like to add to this part of its spectrum portfolio with the Straight Path assets.”  Straight Path, which holds a large trove of 28 GHz and 39 GHz millimeter wave spectrum used in mobile communications, would give a new owner an advantage in 5G development.  Straight Path said on Tuesday that the higher offer was considered a “superior proposal” and it has notified AT&T; that the telecom company has five days to match or exceed the new bid. “We will evaluate the situation and make a decision in that time frame,” AT&T; spokesman Fletcher Cook said in an email. Straight Path’s shares were up 12.5 percent at $124.79, much above the offer price, indicating that investors are expecting an even higher bid to come in.  The new bidder has agreed to cover the termination fee of $38 million that Straight Path would be required to pay AT&T; if it goes with another buyer, Straight Path added.  AT&T; had agreed to buy Straight Path, which holds licenses to wireless spectrum, for $1.25 billion in an all-stock deal on April 10.

1327,VZ,U.S. FCC chief unveils plan to scrap Obama-era internet rules,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the Federal Communications Commission on Thursday released a 58-page draft plan to reverse the landmark 2015 “net neutrality” order and disclosed the agency may withdraw “bright line” rules barring internet companies from blocking, throttling or giving “fast lanes” to some websites. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, named by Trump in January, disclosed his intent Wednesday to repeal the Obama era rules that reclassified internet service and tightly regulated providers as if they were utilities. The FCC also plans to scrap the 2015 internet conduct standard and an ombudsman position created to hear complaints of net neutrality violations. The plan asks if network disclosure requirements should remain in force for internet providers. Pai’s plan faces an initial May 18 vote. He wants public comment on whether the FCC should keep its “bright line” rules, and said his decision on the rules would depend partly on the comments the agency receives. Websites such as Facebook Inc (FB.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and others back the rules, saying they guarantee equal access to the internet. Internet service providers such as AT&T; Inc (T.N), Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) oppose the Obama order, saying they made it harder to manage internet traffic and discouraged investment in improving access. FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn and Federal Trade Commissioner Terrell McSweeny opposed Pai’s plan, saying it “would allow broadband providers to erect barriers or charge tolls to any application, connected device, or website that the broadband providers’ customers want to reach. It would allow broadband providers to favor their own content over others, and pick winners and losers on the internet.” Pai said the 2015 open internet rules were unnecessary because large internet providers did not block websites before they were imposed. “We were not living in some digital dystopia before the partisan imposition of a massive plan hatched in Washington saved all of us,” Pai said Wednesday. The FCC proposal seeks comment “on whether a codified no-blocking rule is needed to protect such freedoms.” The order also asks whether a legal bar on throttling “is still necessary, particularly for smaller providers.” The proposal also questions the ban on “paid prioritization” that the proposal argues was adopted to “address an apparently nonexistent problem.” AT&T; said the question “is not whether the internet will remain open - it undoubtedly will. The question is how, as a country, we will regulate the internet ecosystem.” ",4272017,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-internet-fcc/u-s-fcc-chief-unveils-plan-to-scrap-obama-era-internet-rules-idUSL1N1HZ1DC

Net income attributable to Comcast rose 20.2 percent to $2.57 billion, or 53 cents a share, during the company’s first quarter ended March 31, the company said on Thursday. Revenue rose 8.9 percent to $20.46 billion. Analysts had expected earnings of 44 cents per share and revenue of $20.12 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Comcast is facing pressure in its cable television business as younger viewers shun bigger cable bundles in favor of cheaper streaming options such as Netflix Inc.

Last year, Comcast made Netflix available through its X1 set top box and announced a similar deal with Alphabet Inc’s YouTube in February. The company also plans to offer a wireless service later this year in the hopes of increasing customer loyalty. The service, called Xfinity Mobile, will launch on Verizon Communications Inc’s airwaves as part of a 2011 agreement between the companies. Revenue in Comcast’s cable business rose 5.8 percent as the company added 42,000 video subscribers and 429,000 broadband subscribers in the quarter.

Pai has proposed reversing the reclassification and scrapping internet conduct standards, and has asked for comment on whether the FCC can or should retain any of the rules barring blocking, throttling or “fast lanes.” Judge Sri Srinivasan said in a written opinion reviewing the decision “would be particularly unwarranted at this point in light of the uncertainty surrounding the fate of the FCC’s order.” The FCC is set to hold an initial vote on May 18 on Pai’s proposal but Srinivasan questioned why the full court should review “the validity of a rule that the agency had already slated for replacement.” US Telecom, the trade group representing major telephone companies that sued the FCC in 2015 over the rules, said Monday it will “review our legal options going forward to fully protect our open internet.”   Two dissenting opinions said the 2015 order was unlawful because Congress did not grant the FCC authority to reclassify internet providers.

Some analysts believe Verizon needs a more transformative acquisition than its $4.48 billion deal for Yahoo Inc’s YHOO.O core business to diversify away from the slow-growth wireless industry as it battles smaller rivals in an oversaturated market for U.S. mobile phone service.  Verizon, the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier, last month reported its first-ever quarterly loss in subscribers who pay a monthly bill, its most valuable customers.  After saying he was referring to M&A; speculation, Chief Executive Lowell McAdam told a meeting with analysts, “We don’t feel the urgency that seems to be out there in the analyst community, the banking community and the media.” Verizon’s main competitor, AT&T; Inc (T.N), is planning an $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), which would give it control of cable TV channels like HBO and other coveted media assets. Cable provider Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) was at one time considered a possible target for Verizon. In January, Reuters reported Verizon was interested in exploring a combination with Charter among a long list of potential acquisition targets. But an agreement between Charter and rival cable provider Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) announced on Monday would prohibit a Verizon-Charter combination.  The agreement, which aims to cut costs and speed up the cable companies’ entry into the wireless market, also bars Comcast and Charter from entering into a material transaction for a year without the other company’s consent. That would prevent either company from tying up with a wireless carrier on its own. At the meeting, McAdam said the agreement does not change the companies’ relationships with Verizon.

1339,VZ,"Comcast, Charter to announce wireless partnership on Monday: source","(Reuters) - Comcast Corp and Charter Communications Inc will announce a wireless partnership on Monday, according to a source familiar with the matter, as the cable providers prepare to enter a highly competitive and oversaturated market for mobile service in the United States. The partnership is aimed at cutting the significant costs of entering the wireless market, as well as speeding up entry, the source said.         The deal will bar either company from entering into a material transaction for a year without the other company’s consent, the source said. That would prevent either company from tying up with a wireless carrier immediately on its own.  In January, Reuters reported Verizon Communications Inc was interested in exploring a combination with Charter as part of a long list of acquisition targets, but no proposal had been made for a tie-up between the two companies. Analysts and investors have also speculated that Comcast could buy a U.S. carrier, such as T-Mobile US Inc or Sprint Corp, as its ambitions grow in the wireless market.  At a Lions Gate Entertainment Corp investor conference in January, John Malone, whose Liberty Broadband Corp is Charter’s largest stakeholder, raised the possibility that major cable companies could get together and buy T-Mobile.  Monday’s agreement between Comcast and Charter will allow the companies to cut costs and share technology expertise, as well as offer customers benefits such as seamless connection between their Wi-Fi hotspots, the source added, asking not to be named because the matter is private.  JPMorgan Chase & Co analysts wrote in January that building a wireless business could cost Comcast hundreds of millions of dollars annually in the first few years, potentially cutting as much as 5 cents to 10 cents off earnings per share in 2017.

1341,VZ,Director Francis Ford Coppola weighs in on preserving net neutrality,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Francis Ford Coppola, director of classic films such as “The Godfather” and “Apocalypse Now,” has sent a letter to the top U.S. telecommunications regulator to urge support for “net neutrality,” which prevents internet companies from blocking, throttling or giving “fast lanes” to particular websites. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai, named by President Donald Trump in January, has said that he plans to scrap a 2015 internet conduct standard aimed at preventing broadband providers from favoring their content over others.  In the letter released late on Sunday by advocacy group Public Knowledge, the Oscar-winning filmmaker said the internet was designed so it would not be dominated by giant corporations. “Trusting the leadership of huge corporations with America’s artistic heritage is a crucial mistake, and can already be seen in the ‘monotony’ of contemporary major studio cinema,”  Coppola wrote.  “The changes you are making at the FCC will only make the fragile balance between artist and businessman more impossible to maintain. I assure you that none of the films that I or my contemporaries are known and celebrated for could exist today in such a climate,” he wrote in the brief letter. Big web companies like Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc and others back net neutrality rules, saying they guarantee equal access to the internet.  Internet service providers such as AT&T; Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Comcast Corp oppose net neutrality rules, saying they made it harder to manage internet traffic and discouraged investment in improving access.

1344,VZ,Verizon beats AT&T; to buy spectrum holder Straight Path,"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) snapped up wireless spectrum holder Straight Path Communications Inc STRP.A in a $3.1 billion deal, roughly double rival AT&T;’s (T.N) initial offer, as Verizon seeks an advantage in the race toward a 5G network. The $184 per share all-stock offer represents a discount of 17.8 percent to Straight Path’s close on Wednesday and an equity value of $2.3 billion. The stock had surged nearly five-fold since April 7, a day before AT&T; made the first move with a $95.63 per share offer. Straight Path is one of the largest holders of millimeter wave spectrum, which is expected to play a large role in 5G. In general, 5G is expected to boast higher speeds, shorter response times and more capacity.  The spectrum is particularly important for 5G broadband services that AT&T; and Verizon hope to launch to better compete with high-speed Internet offerings from cable companies. “Verizon now has all of the pieces in place to quickly accelerate the deployment of 5G,” Hans Vestberg, president of global network and technology at Verizon, said in a statement. AT&T; did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In April, AT&T; said it would buy Straight Path for $1.25 billion in an all stock deal.  Straight Path said later that it received a bid from an unnamed bidder that Reuters reported was Verizon, citing sources.  The transaction “positions Verizon well ahead of peers in access to high frequency spectrum holdings suitable for 5G,” analysts at Jefferies said in a note. But shares of Straight Path slumped 20 percent in midday trading to $178 as news of the deal dashed investor hopes of a bidding war between the two largest U.S. wireless carriers. The frenzy around Straight Path started after an anonymous short-seller tipped off regulators in November 2015 that the company had not built communications systems as it had claimed, leading to an investigation by the U.S. Federal Communication Commission. The company settled with the FCC and put itself on the block in January.  Verizon will pay, on behalf of Straight Path, a termination fee of $38 million to AT&T.; The deal is expected to close within nine months, pending review by the FCC. As part of the earlier settlement with FCC, Straight Path will pay the U.S. government a 20 percent cut from the sale of its spectrum licenses.  Evercore was financial adviser to Straight Path and Weil, and Gotshal & Manges served as company counsel on the deal.  Debevoise & Plimpton LLP served as counsel to Verizon.

reached an agreement with SoftBank Group that would allow the Japanese firm to move ahead with its plan to sell Snapdeal to bigger rival Flipkart, ET Now reported, citing sources. ** T-Mobile US will

Holdings Inc said it would seek a majority stake in any Japanese casino project, one of a few domestic firms to detail plans for a sector already drawing intense interest from global gambling companies. ** Japan’s Tokyo Electric Power Co said it will seek partners for its nuclear business as part of a recovery plan after the Fukushima disaster of six years ago brought the utility to its knees and put it under state control. ** Saudi Arabia’s Al Borg Medical Laboratories, one of the largest private medical laboratory chains in the Gulf, has agreed to buy the lab business of Anglo Arabian Healthcare, majority owned by Waha Capital, sources told Reuters. ** The head of German sportswear company Adidas rejected calls from some shareholders to sell the loss-making Reebok brand,

International Corp, calling the U.S. contract research firm’s shares “undervalued” and that it represented an attractive investment opportunity. ** Wilmar International Ltd, the world’s largest palm

1350,VZ,Fitch Rates Verizon's Sr. Unsecured Offering 'A-'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 12 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to Verizon Communications Inc.'s (NYSE: VZ) issuance of $1.5 billion senior unsecured floating rate notes due 2020. Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of outstanding debt. Verizon's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is 'A-', and the Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS Competitive Position: The ratings are supported by Verizon Wireless's (VZW) strong competitive position, as evidenced through industry-low churn rates, high margins and the extensive coverage of approximately 98% of the U.S. population with its 4G LTE network. These factors are balanced against moderately high leverage for the rating, which stems from the February 2014 acquisition of the remaining 45% stake in VZW, as well as the intensely competitive wireless environment. Core Telecom Leverage: Including the effects of the Yahoo acquisition and data center sale, Fitch expects Verizon's core telecom leverage and total adjusted debt/EBITDAR to remain relatively stable in 2017, relative to year-end 2016 core telecom leverage of 2.4x and total adjusted debt/EBITDAR was 3.0x. Core telecom leverage excludes securitizations (both off-balance-sheet and public/144A and on-balance-sheet asset-backed securitizations). Securitizations are included in total adjusted debt/EBITDAR measures. Pending Yahoo! Acquisition: Verizon's acquisition of Yahoo! Inc.'s operating businesses is expected to close in the second quarter of 2017 (2Q17). In February 2017, the two parties amended their agreement following an investigation into two potentially separate incidents regarding the loss of certain customer data. The amended agreement lowered the price by $350 million to approximately $4.48 billion (subject to closing adjustments) and amended the terms regarding post-close liabilities. Data Center Sale: Verizon completed the $3.6 billion sale of its U.S. and Latin American data center sites to Equinix, Inc. on May 1, 2017. Straight Path Communications: Verizon has agreed to acquire the company in a $3.1 billion in an all-stock transaction. Straight Path holds millimeter wave licenses nationwide in the 39 GHz band and licences in major markets in the 28 GHz. The spectrum will be used to accelerate the deployment of 5G wireless services. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Fitch assumes modest revenue and EBITDA growth for Verizon over the next few years as the effects of the transition to unsubsidized wireless service pricing and unlimited service plans wind down and as acquisitions contribute to growth. --Debt reduction in the core business, combined with EBITDA growth, is expected to reduce core telecom leverage. --VZW will continue to generate strong free cash flow (FCF) on an operational basis. VZW's simple FCF (EBITDA less capital spending) for the LTM ending March 31, 2017 was approximately $27.4 billion. --Fitch expects VZW's consolidated capital spending in 2017 to be within company guidance of $16.8 billion to $17.5 billion. Investment in the wireless network, including related investments in fiber, continues to be an area of emphasis due to the strong demand for 4G LTE capacity for rapidly growing data services. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive Rating Action: Fitch believes a positive rating action is unlikely in the foreseeable future, given current levels of leverage. Negative Rating Action: Fitch may take a negative rating action if operating performance causes deleveraging to take place at a materially slower-than-anticipated pace, either alone or in combination with material debt-financed acquisitions. Discretionary management moves that cause core telecom leverage to rise above 2.5x, such as another material acquisition or stock repurchases, could lead to a negative action in the absence of a strong commitment to deleveraging. LIQUIDITY Strong Liquidity Profile: Verizon's liquidity is supported by its reported consolidated cash balance, which was $4.3 billion at March 31, 2017, and by its undrawn revolving credit facility (RCF). The RCF has availability of $9 billion and matures in September 2020. Fitch expects Verizon to maintain aggregate commercial paper (CP) balances within a level fully backed by the RCF. The credit facility has no ratings triggers or other restrictive financial covenants, such as leverage or interest coverage tests. Verizon's cash from operations in 2017 will be negatively affected by wireless handset financing under the equipment installment programs, as the public securitizations funding handset sales beginning in 3Q16 are recorded in cash from financing activities. Debt Maturities: On a consolidated basis, as of March 31, 2017, Verizon and its subsidiaries had expected debt maturities (excluding capital leases) of approximately $1.8 billion and $5.2 billion in 2017 and 2018, respectively.

1358,VZ,UPDATE 2-U.S. FCC votes 2-1 to advance repeal of Obama-era internet rules,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission voted 2-1 on Thursday to advance a Republican plan to reverse the Obama administration’s 2015 “net neutrality” order. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai wants the commission repeal the rules that reclassified internet service providers as if they were utilities. He thinks the open internet rules adopted under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, were unnecessary and harm jobs and investment. “We propose to repeal utility-style regulation,” Pai said on  Thursday. “This is the right way to go.” Stocks of major internet providers rose on Thursday. The public will have until mid-August to offer comments before the FCC votes on a final plan. Pai wants public input on whether the FCC has the authority or should keep its “bright line” rules barring internet companies from blocking, throttling or giving “fast lanes” to some websites. Pai declined on Thursday to commit to retaining any rules, but said he favors an “open internet.” He added he would make public a final proposal before a final vote. Democratic FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, who voted against the plan, said the end game appears to be an internet without FCC regulatory oversight. She said the proposal “jeopardizes the ability of the open internet to function tomorrow, as it does today.” Many companies and Republicans think Congress should pass legislation clarifying the FCC’s role to resolve a decade-long dispute over internet regulations. The FCC, which has already received more than 1 million comments, is also seeking comment on whether U.S. states should be able to set their own internet regulations governing broadband privacy and other issues. Facebook Inc (FB.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and other internet companies back net neutrality rules, saying they guarantee equal access to the internet. Broadband providers AT&T; Inc (T.N), Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) oppose the 2015 order, saying it discourages investment and innovation. Providers insist they will not engage in blocking or throttling even in the absence of rules, but critics are skeptical. U.S. Senator Brian Schatz, a Democrat, said “it will take millions of people standing up, just like they did before, to say that the internet needs to stay free and open. That’s what it will take to win.” Comcast, Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) and Altice NV’s (ATCA.AS) U.S. unit and others signed an advertisement committing “to an open internet that gives you the freedom to be in charge of your online experience ...

1360,VZ,U.S. FCC to take initial vote to roll back Obama-era internet rules,"May 18 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission will hold an initial vote on Thursday on a Republican plan to reverse the Obama administration’s 2015 “net neutrality” order. FCC chairman Ajit Pai disclosed in April the agency may withdraw “bright line” rules barring internet companies from blocking, throttling or giving “fast lanes” to some websites. The debate over the future of the internet has received less attention than it did in 2015, with many focused on other issues such as President Donald Trump’s May 9 firing of FBI director Jim Comey and its aftermath. “In the rubble of this week, the FCC is formally starting the process of destroying net neutrality,” Senator Brian Schatz, a Democrat, said on Wednesday. A number of Democratic senators plan to attend a rally on Thursday outside the FCC meeting with opponents. The other Republican on the FCC, which currently has three members, supports Pai. The public will have until mid-August to offer comments before the FCC votes on a final plan. Pai said in April he wants the FCC to repeal the rules that reclassified internet service and tightly regulated providers as if they were utilities. He thinks the 2015 open internet rules were unnecessary and harm jobs and investment. “We were not living in some digital dystopia before the partisan imposition of a massive plan hatched in Washington saved all of us,” Pai said in April. Pai wants public input on whether the FCC should keep its “bright line” rules, and said his decision would depend partly on the comments. He has not committed to retaining any rules, but said he favors an “open internet.” Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc and others back net neutrality rules, saying they guarantee equal access to the internet. Broadband providers AT&T; Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Comcast Corp oppose the 2015 order, saying it would discourage investment and innovation.

1363,VZ,Fitch Affirms Verizon's IDR at 'A-'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 01 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'A-' Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) and senior unsecured debt ratings for Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon; NYSE: VZ) and its subsidiaries. Fitch has also affirmed Verizon's Short-Term IDR and commercial paper (CP) ratings at 'F2'. The Rating Outlook remains Stable. A full list of ratings actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Competitive Position: The ratings are supported by Verizon Wireless's (VZW) strong competitive position, as evidenced through industry-low churn rates, high margins and the extensive coverage of approximately 98% of the U.S. population with its 4G LTE network. These factors are balanced against the intensely competitive wireless environment as well as the moderately high leverage for the rating, which stems from the February 2014 acquisition of the remaining 45% stake in VZW. The traditional smartphone offering has matured, and Verizon has had to respond to smaller operators competitively, while emerging applications, where Verizon is strongly positioned, are in a nascent stage. Core Telecom Leverage: Including the effects of a discretionary pension contribution that accelerated near-term minimum contributions, the effects of the Yahoo and XO acquisitions, and the data center sale, Fitch expects Verizon's core telecom leverage to increase slightly to 2.4x in 2017, relative to year-end 2016 core telecom leverage of 2.3x. To determine core telecom leverage, Fitch has applied a 5:1 debt to equity ratio to the company's handset receivables, after adding back off balance sheet securitizations. Impact of Unlimited: On Feb. 12, Verizon responded competitively to the unlimited offers in the market by initiating their unlimited plan. In the near term, the move to unlimited's effect on revenues is negative as 'optimizers' opt down and the company loses revenues from customers on large data packages and those that incur overages. Revenue trends have improved since the introduction of unlimited, but the sustainability of these trends will need to be monitored over the course of 2017. Longer-term, there is potential for some improvement in revenue as customers on lower-sized data plans consume more data and eventually move up to an unlimited package (data traffic on Verizon's LTE network increased 57% year over year). Pending Yahoo! Acquisition: Verizon's acquisition of Yahoo! Inc.'s operating businesses is expected to close in the middle of 2017. In February 2017, the two parties amended their agreement following an investigation into two potentially separate incidents regarding certain security and data breaches impacting customer data. The amended agreement lowered the price by $350 million to approximately $4.48 billion (subject to closing adjustments) and amended the terms regarding post-close liabilities. Data Center Sale: Verizon completed the $3.6 billion sale of its U.S. and Latin American data center sites to Equinix, Inc. on May 1, 2017. Straight Path Communications: Verizon has agreed to acquire the company for $3.1 billion in an all-stock transaction. Straight Path holds millimeter wave licenses nationwide in the 39 GHz band and licences in major markets in the 28 GHz. The spectrum will be used to accelerate the deployment of 5G wireless services. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Fitch assumes modest revenue and EBITDA growth for Verizon over the next few years as the effects of the transition to unsubsidized wireless service pricing and unlimited service plans wind down and as acquisitions contribute to growth. --Core debt is expected to increase modestly in 2017 but then remain relatively stable. --VZW will continue to generate strong free cash flow (FCF) on an operational basis. VZW's simple FCF (EBITDA less capital spending) for the LTM ending March 31, 2017 was approximately $27.4 billion. --Fitch expects Verizon's consolidated capital spending in 2017 to be within company guidance of $16.8 billion to $17.5 billion and within historical levels for 2018. Investment in the wireless network, including related investments in fiber, continues to be an area of emphasis due to the strong demand for 4G LTE capacity for rapidly growing data services. --The company is currently conducting 5G trails, which could lead to higher capital spending, but is dependent on the outcome of those trials and an assessment of the opportunities. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive Rating Action: Fitch believes a positive rating action is unlikely in the foreseeable future, given current levels of leverage. Negative Rating Action: Fitch may take a negative rating action if operating performance causes deleveraging to take place at a materially slower-than-anticipated pace, either alone or in combination with material debt-financed acquisitions. Discretionary management moves that cause core telecom leverage to rise above 2.5x, such as another material acquisition or stock repurchases, could lead to a negative action in the absence of a strong commitment to deleveraging. LIQUIDITY Strong Liquidity Profile: Verizon's liquidity is supported by its reported consolidated cash balance, which was $4.3 billion at March 31, 2017, and by its undrawn revolving credit facility (RCF). The RCF has availability of $9 billion and matures in September 2020. Fitch expects Verizon to maintain aggregate CP balances within a level fully backed by the RCF. The credit facility has no ratings triggers or other restrictive financial covenants, such as leverage or interest coverage tests. Verizon's cash from operations in 2017 will be negatively affected by wireless handset financing under the equipment installment programs, as the public securitizations funding handset sales beginning in 3Q16 are recorded in cash from financing activities. Debt Maturities: On a consolidated basis, as of March 31, 2017, Verizon and its subsidiaries had expected debt maturities (excluding capital leases) of approximately $1.8 billion and $5.2 billion in 2017 and 2018, respectively. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Verizon Communications Inc. --Long-term IDR at 'A-'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A-'; --Senior unsecured bank facility at 'A-'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'. Alltel Corp. GTE Corp. Verizon Delaware Verizon Maryland Verizon New England Verizon New Jersey Verizon New York Verizon Pennsylvania Verizon Virginia --IDR at 'A-'; --Senior unsecured at 'A-'. Cellco Partnership --IDR at 'A-'. Fitch has also assigned the following ratings: Verizon Communications Inc. --Senior unsecured $500 million InterNotes 'A-'; --Senior unsecured Swiss Franc notes 'A-'. Fitch has withdrawn the following rating due to its repayment: Verizon Communications Inc. --Senior unsecured term loan due 2019 'A-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch’s ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided “as is” without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.

1384,VZ,UPDATE 2-Tech firms protest proposed changes to U.S. net neutrality rules,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Facebook Inc (FB.O), Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and dozens of other major technology companies protested online on Wednesday against proposed changes to U.S. net neutrality rules that prohibit broadband providers from giving or selling access to certain internet services over others. In support of the “Internet-Wide Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality,” more than 80,000 websites - from big social media platforms like Facebook to streaming services like Netflix and matchmaking website OkCupid - are displaying banners, alerts, ads and short videos to urge the public to oppose the overturn of the landmark 2015 net neutrality rules. Net neutrality is a broad principle that prohibits broadband providers from giving or selling access to speedy internet, essentially a “fast lane,” to certain internet services over others. The rule was implemented by the Obama administration in 2015. Changes to the rule are being proposed by the head of the U.S. Federal Communications Commision (FCC), Ajit Pai, appointed by President Donald Trump in January.  Pai wants the commission to repeal the rules that reclassified internet service providers as if they were utilities, saying the open internet rules adopted under former President Barack Obama harm jobs and investment. The FCC voted 2-1 in May to advance a Republican plan to reverse the “net neutrality” order. During a speech in April, Pai asked: “Do we want the government to control the internet? Or do we want to embrace the light-touch approach” in place since 1996 until it was revised in 2015. At a Capitol Hill press conference, Democrats and internet companies vowed to fight the changes and suggested internet companies could slow internet speeds. Senator Edward Markey said the internet “is under attack.” “We will not let this takeover happen,” Markey said. “A free and open internet is our right and we will fight to defend it.” Major broadband providers, including AT&T; Inc (T.N) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), acknowledged the public support for net neutrality. They emphasized they are in favor of an “open internet” but made clear they oppose the 2015 net neutrality reclassification order that they say could lead to government rate regulation. FCC spokesman Brian Hart declined to comment. FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, the sole Democrat on a commission with two current vacancies, said in a statement on Wednesday she supports “those who believe that a free and open internet is a foundational principle of our democracy.” The public will have until mid-August to send comments to the FCC before the final vote.  More than 550,000 comments have been filed in the last day with the FCC and more than 6.3 million filed to date and thousands of people called Capitol Hill offices to express concerns. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote on the social media platform, “Right now, the FCC has rules in place to make sure the internet continues to be an open platform for everyone. At Facebook, we strongly support those rules.”     Twitter expressed support for the existing rules, encouraging users to protest while promoting the hashtag #NetNeutrality. “Net Neutrality is foundational to competitive, free enterprise, entrepreneurial market entry – and reaching global customers. You don’t have to be a big shot to compete. Anyone with a great idea, a unique perspective to share, and a compelling vision can get in the game,” Twitter said in a blog. Online forum Reddit displayed a pop-up message that slowly loads the text, “The internet’s less fun when your favorite sites load slowly, isn’t it?”  Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) displayed banners on top of the home page while Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) posted a short video explaining net neutrality, urging consumers to send comments to the FCC. A pop-up banner on The American Civil Liberties Union’s website read: “Trump’s FCC wants to kill net neutrality. This would let the cable and phone companies slow down any site they don’t like or that won’t pay extra.” ",7122017,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fcc-neutrality/update-2-tech-firms-protest-proposed-changes-to-u-s-net-neutrality-rules-idUSL1N1K316T

1387,VZ,Verizon in talks to buy WideOpenWest's Chicago network: sources,"(Reuters) - U.S. wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) is in talks to acquire cable operator WideOpenWest Inc’s (WOW.N) fiber network in the Chicago area for more than $200 million, according to people familiar with the matter. There has been a flurry of dealmaking for fiber assets, as growing demand from U.S. businesses for data transmission has fueled a revival in fiber optic services and is pushing large telecommunication companies to bulk up in fiber. Earlier this month, tower operator Crown Castle International Corp (CCI.N) said it would buy Lightower Fiber Networks for $7.1 billion, in a bid to boost its data traffic capabilities. No deal between WideOpenWest and Verizon is certain and negotiations could still fall apart, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Another buyer could still emerge for the asset, the sources added. WideOpenWest, which has market capitalization of around $1.4 billion and went public in May, is working with a financial adviser to explore a sale of the unit, the people said.  WideOpenWest did not respond to a request for comment. Verizon declined to comment.  Since 2014, WideOpenWest has built about 1,200 miles of fiber in the Chicago market for a “leading wireless carrier,” according to a corporate filing. The sources identified this carrier as Verizon. Verizon uses WideOpenWest’s fiber system in Chicago for backhaul, which is the data transfer of mobile traffic over wired lines, according to the sources. While it is under a long-term contract with the wireless carrier, WideOpenWest had said it expected it would find more business customers to use the fiber.  Verizon views fiber as critical for its next generation 5G wireless technology and has been testing a 5G fixed wireless service with equipment maker Ericsson (ERICb.ST) before a commercial launch as early as 2018. Verizon has also said it would evaluate opportunities to build out or buy fiber on a market-by-market basis. In April, it struck a deal to buy optical fiber from Corning Inc (GLW.N) for at least $1.05 billion over the next three years. In February, it closed on its acquisition of XO Communications’ fiber-optic network business for about $1.8 billion. Verizon reported quarterly revenue that topped analyst expectations on Thursday, adding 614,000 subscribers who pay a monthly bill, including tablet customers..

1389,VZ,US STOCKS-Wall St trims gains as tech stocks weigh,"* Facebook jumps after quarterly results beat expectations * Twitter falls on weaker-than-expected user growth * Verizon up after posting subscriber growth * Amazon, Intel, Starbucks to report results after the bell * Dow up 0.19 pct, S&P; off 0.05 pct, Nasdaq down 0.22 pct (Updates to early afternoon) By Tanya Agrawal July 27 (Reuters) - Wall Street trimmed gains in early afternoon trading on Thursday as tech stocks, including heavyweights Apple and Google parent Alphabet , edged lower. The three major indexes hit record highs earlier in the day, powered by a barrage of strong quarterly earnings, led by Facebook and Verizon. Facebook jumped as much as 5.96 percent to a record high after the social network’s results topped Wall Street estimates. Verizon surged 7.27 percent to a three-month high after the company reported quarterly subscriber additions that topped estimates. The stock put the S&P; telecommunications index on track to post its biggest one-day percentage gain in more than eight years. Still, the S&P; technology sector remains the best performing sector as investors look for growth in an otherwise low-growth environment. The index was down 0.88 percent. Online giant Amazon is due to report results after the bell, along with Intel. “Technology stocks are beating estimates by a large margin and most tech companies are growing at a core, organic rate without the economy growing too much,” said Aaron Clark, portfolio manager at GW&K; Investment Management. Earnings of S&P; 500 companies are now expected to have climbed 10.7 percent in the second quarter, up from an 8 percent rise estimated at the start of the month, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. With equity markets at record levels, investors have been counting on strong earnings to justify the relatively expensive stock valuations. “While multiples are not cheap and are expected to grow further, strong earnings are justifying these levels,” said Clark. At 12:55 p.m. ET (1655 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 40.46 points, or 0.19 percent, at 21,751.47, the S&P; 500 was down 1.46 points, or 0.05 percent, at 2,476.37. The Nasdaq Composite was down 14.01 points, or 0.22 percent, at 6,408.74. Five of the 11 major S&P; sectors were higher, with the telecommunication index’s 4.50 percent rise leading the advancers. However, losses in Amgen, Johnson and Johnson and Celgene led to a 0.32 percent drop in the healthcare sector. Industrials were driven lower by a 3.95 percent fall in United Parcel Service, despite the package service company posting a better-than-expected quarterly profit. Twitter fell as much as 14.07 percent, putting it on track for it’s biggest one-day fall since October, after the company’s quarterly results showed it failed to add users on a monthly basis in the second quarter, compared with the first quarter. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,466 to 1,323. On the Nasdaq, 1,742 issues fell and 1,038 advanced.

1390,VZ,Verizon quarterly subscriber additions top estimates; shares up,"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc reported quarterly revenue that topped expectations on Thursday as the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier attracted more subscribers with its unlimited data plan. Shares jumped 3.6 percent to $46.01 in premarket trading. In the quarter, Verizon added 614,000 subscribers who pay a monthly bill, including tablet customers, compared to an increase of 615,000 in the year-earlier period. The additions were higher than the JPMorgan estimate of 115,000 and consensus expectations of 70,000, JPMorgan analysts said in a research note on Thursday. Verizon has been competing for customers with smaller rivals T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp in a saturated U.S. market for wireless service as most consumers already have cell phones.  In February, Verizon reintroduced an unlimited data plan for the first time in more than five years. Since then, other carriers have launched aggressive promotions. Sprint said in June that it was offering free unlimited data, talk and text for a year to consumers who bring their own devices in a promotion aimed at Verizon subscribers. The company added 358,000 phone-only subscribers, compared with 86,000 net additions a year ago. Verizon’s unlimited plan, priced at $80 a month for a single line, is more expensive than competing plans. Chief Financial Officer Matthew Ellis said Thursday’s post-earnings conference call that “even with the price premium we have, it shows that customers value the high-quality network experience that we deliver.” Churn, or the rate of customer defections for subscribers paying a monthly bill, was flat at 0.94 percent from the year-earlier period, and lower than analysts’ estimates of 1.1 percent, according to JPMorgan.  Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, called the subscriber numbers “very strong,” but added that “we remain cautious on Verizon equity given what we regard as unsustainable margins and returns in a competitive market.” Net income attributable to Verizon rose to $4.36 billion, or $1.07 per share, in the second quarter, from $702 million, or 17 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, earnings were 96 cents per share. Total operating revenue edged up to $30.55 billion from $30.53 billion a year earlier. Analysts expected adjusted earnings per share of 96 cents on revenue of $29.91 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The latest quarter included a gain from the sale of data centers and lower expenses. Earnings in the year-earlier period were also hurt by a strike in the wireline business.

Facebook jumped 4.23 percent, lifting both the S&P; 500 and the Nasdaq Composite indexes, after the social network’s results beat Wall Street estimates. Verizon surged 6 percent to $47 after its quarterly subscriber additions topped estimates. The stock was the second-biggest gainer on both the S&P; and the Dow. Earnings of S&P; 500 companies are now expected to have climbed 9.9 percent in the second quarter, up from a projection of an 8 percent rise at the start of the month, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. With equity markets at record levels, investors have been counting on strong earnings to justify the relatively expensive stock valuations. “The earnings season has arguably taken on additional importance this quarter due to the inability of Donald Trump to, so far, deliver on the growth agenda that won him the White House back in November,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at online forex broker Oanda. “Even in the absence of tax cuts and fiscal stimulus, corporate America has continued to perform well, with companies exceeding expectations on both the top and bottom line.” Investor sentiment also got a boost after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday. The central bank noted that both overall inflation and a measure of underlying price gains had declined. The statement was perceived as dovish by investors, with rate futures pricing in a 38 percent chance of an interest rate hike by December, compared with a little over 50 percent chance priced in before the meeting. At 9:43 a.m. ET (1343 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 64.76 points, or 0.3 percent, at 21,775.77 and the S&P; 500 was up 3.18 points, or 0.12 percent, at 2,481.01. The Nasdaq Composite was up 23.83 points, or 0.37 percent, at 6,446.57. Five of the 11 major S&P; sectors were higher, with the telecommunication index’s 2.39 percent rise leading the advancers. Twitter was down 13.46 percent after the company’s quarterly results showed it failed to add users on a monthly basis in the second quarter, compared with the first quarter. PayPal Holdings rose 2.53 percent, while Dunkin’ Brands was up 2.60 percent after their quarterly reports. United Parcel Service fell 2.25 percent despite the U.S. domestic package service posting a better-than-expected quarterly profit. Online giant Amazon, Intel, Starbucks and Mattel are among those reporting results after the bell. Economic data showed durable goods orders rose more than-expected in June, while weekly jobless claims rebounded from a three-month low last week. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,263 to 1,249. On the Nasdaq, 1,177 issues rose and 1,154 fell.

1392,VZ,"UPDATE 1-Comcast 2nd-qtr results top estimates on film, theme parks growth","(Adds details from the earnings call, updates share price) By Anjali Athavaley and Jessica Toonkel NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp on Thursday reported quarterly results that topped analysts’ estimates on higher revenue in its filmed entertainment and theme parks businesses, even as the No. 1 U.S. cable operator lost more video subscribers. Comcast’s shares rose 2 percent to $40.16 in early trading. Comcast and other pay television operators are facing pressure as younger viewers drop bigger cable bundles for cheaper streaming options such as Netflix Inc and the growing number of online “skinny bundles” of channels. Comcast and cable operator Charter Communications Inc are in talks with Sprint Corp about a partnership to boost the two U.S. cable companies’ wireless offerings, sources had told Reuters in June. Meanwhile, Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts dismissed speculation on Thursday that Comcast needed to buy or merge with another company. “I think I’ve said, and I think we’ve said in multiple forms, that we really feel we are not missing anything,” Roberts said on the company’s analyst call Thursday morning. Comcast has taken a number of steps to allow users of its X1 set top box to get access to a variety of content. Last year, Comcast made Netflix available through X1 and announced a similar deal with Alphabet Inc’s YouTube in February. Still, Comcast lost 34,000 video subscribers in the quarter, compared with the 4,000 customers lost in the year-earlier period. Comcast also added 175,000 broadband subscribers, compared with additions of 220,000 a year ago. The proliferation of “skinny bundles,” however, helps its NBCUniversal media unit’s bottom line because the company has very favorable terms for its content on those services, Roberts said, adding he was skeptical about the skinny-bundle business becoming profitable. Comcast introduced a wireless service in May in hopes of bundling more services together and increasing customer loyalty. The service, called Xfinity Mobile, launched on Verizon Communications Inc’s airwaves as part of a 2011 agreement between the companies. Early results indicate the mobile service is off to a strong start, though the company did not disclose subscriber numbers. Net income attributable to Comcast rose 23.9 percent to $2.51 billion, or 52 cents a share, in the second quarter, from $2.03 billion, or 41 cents a share. Revenue was up 9.8 percent to $21.16 billion. Analysts expected earnings of 48 cents per share on revenue of $20.85 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Filmed entertainment revenue rose 59.6 percent on the strength of movies such as “The Fate of the Furious” while theme parks revenue increased 15.6 percent.

1405,VZ,Verizon launches cheaper unlimited plan to compete with rivals,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc said on Tuesday that it was introducing a cheaper unlimited mobile data plan with some limits as it tries to lure customers away from rival wireless carriers. The plan, to be introduced on Wednesday, is priced at $75 a month for a single line and will include DVD-quality video streaming on smartphones rather than high definition. It allows Verizon to slow down consumers’ data speeds in times of congestion and does not include calling and data in Mexico and Canada. It also has slower mobile hotspot speeds of 600 kilobits per second. “While entry-level pricing appears more competitive, the changes more likely reflect the impact current plans are having on Verizon’s network,” Mike McCormack, an analyst at Jefferies, said in a note. “The move also follows a trend of differentiating unlimited plans to manage congestion and monetize the network.” Verizon has been competing for customers with smaller rivals T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp in a saturated U.S. market for wireless service as most consumers already have cell phones.  Other carriers have been launching aggressive promotions in recent months. Sprint said in June it was offering free unlimited data, talk and text for a year to consumers who bring their own devices in a promotion aimed at Verizon subscribers. Verizon’s new cheaper plan is aimed at casual smartphone users versus customers who want to stream a lot of video, a Verizon spokeswoman said. The company also is introducing a higher-end unlimited data plan for $85 a month for a single line that includes HD-quality streaming on phones and calling, texting and data in Mexico and Canada, and mobile hotspot with up to 15 gigabytes of LTE speeds.

1406,VZ,Verizon launches cheaper unlimited plan to compete with rivals,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc said on Tuesday that it was introducing a cheaper unlimited mobile data plan with some limits as it tries to lure customers away from rival wireless carriers. The plan, to be introduced on Wednesday, is priced at $75 a month for a single line and will include DVD-quality video streaming on smartphones rather than high definition. It allows Verizon to slow down consumers’ data speeds in times of congestion and does not include calling and data in Mexico and Canada. It also has slower mobile hotspot speeds of 600 kilobits per second. “While entry-level pricing appears more competitive, the changes more likely reflect the impact current plans are having on Verizon’s network,” Mike McCormack, an analyst at Jefferies, said in a note. “The move also follows a trend of differentiating unlimited plans to manage congestion and monetize the network.” Verizon has been competing for customers with smaller rivals T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp in a saturated U.S. market for wireless service as most consumers already have cell phones.  Other carriers have been launching aggressive promotions in recent months. Sprint said in June it was offering free unlimited data, talk and text for a year to consumers who bring their own devices in a promotion aimed at Verizon subscribers. Verizon’s new cheaper plan is aimed at casual smartphone users versus customers who want to stream a lot of video, a Verizon spokeswoman said. The company also is introducing a higher-end unlimited data plan for $85 a month for a single line that includes HD-quality streaming on phones and calling, texting and data in Mexico and Canada, and mobile hotspot with up to 15 gigabytes of LTE speeds.   The options will replace Verizon’s previous unlimited data plan, launched in February for $80 a month for a single line.  Verizon shares were down 4 cents to $48.10 in morning trading.

1408,VZ,Yahoo must face litigation by data breach victims: U.S. judge,"(Reuters) - A U.S. judge said Yahoo must face nationwide litigation brought on behalf of well over 1 billion users who said their personal information was compromised in three massive data breaches. Wednesday night’s decision from U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, was a setback for efforts by Verizon Communications Inc, which paid $4.76 billion for Yahoo’s Internet business in June, to limit potential liability. The breaches occurred between 2013 and 2016, but Yahoo was slow to disclose them, waiting more than three years to reveal the first. Revelations about the scope of the cyber attacks prompted Verizon to lower its purchase price for the company. In a 93-page decision, Koh rejected Yahoo’s contention that breach victims lacked standing to sue, and said they could pursue some breach of contract and unfair competition claims. “All plaintiffs have alleged a risk of future identity theft, in addition to loss of value of their personal identification information,” the judge wrote. Koh said some plaintiffs also alleged they had spent money to thwart future identity theft or that fraudsters had misused their data. Others, meanwhile, could have changed passwords or canceled their accounts to stem losses had Yahoo not delayed disclosing the breaches, the judge said. While many claims were dismissed, Koh said the plaintiffs could amend their complaint to address her concerns. “We believe it to be a significant victory for consumers, and will address the deficiencies the court pointed out,” John Yanchunis, a lawyer for the plaintiffs who chairs an executive committee overseeing the case, said in an interview. “It’s the biggest data breach in the history of the world.” Verizon spokesman Bob Varettoni said the New York-based company declined to comment on pending litigation. Yahoo is now part of a Verizon unit called Oath. In court papers, Yahoo had argued that the breaches were “a triumph of criminal persistence” by a “veritable ‘who’s who’ of cybercriminals,” and that no security system is hack-proof. On March 15, the U.S. Department of Justice charged two officers of the Russian Federal Security Service and two hackers in connection with the second breach in late 2014. The August 2013 breach affected more than 1 billion accounts, while the 2014 breach affected more than 500 million. A third breach occurred in 2015 and 2016.

1413,VZ,Verizon has moved on from plans to acquire cable companies: CEO,"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) said on Thursday that it has moved on from plans to acquire cable companies and instead will focus on building out its own fiber infrastructure. Speculation over a tie-up with Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) was building up after Chief Executive Lowell McAdam told Wall Street analysts last year that such a deal would make “industrial sense”. McAdam said on Thursday at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia Conference that Verizon is more interested in building up its fiber infrastructure. “We did, I guess, about a year ago, go through a process of taking a look at cable companies. But the fiber infrastructure isn’t there,” McAdam said. In April, Verizon agreed to buy optical fiber from Corning Inc (GLW.N) for at least $1.05 billion over the next three years to improve its network infrastructure. McAdam said at the conference on Thursday the company would be acquiring content for its Oath business and a content deal is expected by the end of September. Verizon bought Yahoo’s core business for $4.48 billion in 2016. It then combined Yahoo with AOL to form a venture called Oath. McAdam said the company expects cost savings of $10 billion over four years from operating expenses and capital expenses, which would fund their dividends in 2022.

1415,VZ,U.S. Senate plans to vote on FCC chairman tenure this week,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday moved to force the Senate to vote later this week on the nomination of Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai to serve another five-year term. The vote on Pai is expected after Democrats plan to harshly criticize him for moving to dismantle Obama-era internet access rules and taking other steps to deregulate U.S. telecommunications rules. McConnell on Tuesday filed a petition to force a vote to end debate on Pai’s nomination. Pai, a former Justice Department, FCC and Capitol Hill staffer, has been moving swiftly to undo many of the regulations adopted by the FCC during the Obama administration since assuming the chairmanship. Pai joined the FCC as a commissioner in March 2012 and was elevated to chairman by President Donald Trump in January. He would be forced to leave at the end of this year if the Senate does not reconfirm him to a new five-year-term In April, Pai proposed overturning the landmark 2015 net neutrality rules. On Tuesday, Pai declined to say when he might ask the FCC to give final approval to the proposal. The rules, which the FCC put in place under Democratic President Barack Obama, prohibit broadband providers from giving or selling access to speedy internet, essentially a “fast lane,” to certain internet services over others. The rules reclassified internet service providers much like utilities. They were favored by web companies like Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc and others, which said they would guarantee equal access to the internet to all, but opposed by internet service providers, which said they could eventually result in rate regulation, inhibit innovation and make it harder to manage traffic. Internet providers such as AT&T; Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Comcast Corp have argued that the net neutrality rules have made investment in additional capacity less likely. Earlier this year, the FCC voted 2-1 to reverse a 2016 decision that limits the number of television stations some broadcasters can buy. Pai has said he plans to take a new look at the current overall limit on companies owning stations serving no more than 39 percent of U.S. television households and plans a comprehensive review of close to 1,000 pages of media regulations.

1422,VZ,Breakingviews - Yahoo’s corpse keeps festering at Verizon," NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Yahoo is like a zombie feasting on Verizon’s brains. Marni Walden, a top executive at the $200 billion U.S. telecom group, is leaving just a day after the internet firm she helped to acquire tripled its tally of customer accounts exposed to a 2013 hack. While the company suggests the timing is a coincidence, it’s clear that Yahoo is a problem that continues to fester.  Verizon disclosed that Walden will exit at the end of the year in a two-sentence regulatory filing on Wednesday. The 50-year-old executive vice president was a rising star and a rare female in the upper ranks, who could have been a credible successor to Chief Executive Lowell McAdam. As the head of media, Walden also oversaw the creation of Oath, a combination of acquired 1990s internet brands Yahoo and AOL, to help shore up Verizon’s digital advertising offerings.  Even if buying Yahoo had a certain business rationale, it has proven to be a real pain in the side. Two hacking incidents revealed last year nearly scotched the deal. Verizon wrangled a $350 million price cut from Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer, but that may have been too little. On Tuesday it emerged that all 3 billion of Yahoo’s user accounts were compromised.  Verizon said that Walden’s departure and the latest revelation were unrelated. She is pursuing outside opportunities because she was unlikely to be the next chief executive, the Wall Street Journal reported. Others now in the running to replace McAdam, 63, include John Stratton, head of global operations, and Hans Vestberg, who once led Ericsson and is now Verizon’s chief technology officer.  Either of those would suggest that Verizon is now more interested in building out a fiber network than reinventing the media landscape. At least it only plunked down $9 billion for Oath. Meanwhile, rival AT&T is still splashing out on satellite distribution and media, paying some $175 billion for DirecTV and Time Warner. It ought to learn from Verizon’s experience: risky deals may come back to haunt.

1427,VZ,Verizon to pay $17.7 million to resolve school broadband probe,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) said on Tuesday it will pay $17.7 million to resolve a probe by U.S. regulators and the Justice Department into potential payment violations related to a federal school broadband program. The program, called E-rate, is a federal government-backed scheme that provides subsidized broadband and internet service for schools and libraries in the United States and is funded through monthly fees on phone service. The Federal Communications Commission, the U.S. telecoms regulator, and the Department of Justice said Verizon had invoiced the FCC for consultant charges that were not allowed under an E-rate contract it had to supply the New York City Department of Education with its services. Verizon said on Tuesday that “today’s settlements fairly resolve years of work by Verizon and the government to return funding to the program.” The company said that it was a victim of fraud, citing the conviction of a former New York City Department of Education consultant, Willard Lanham. Lanham was sentenced to 37 months in prison in 2012. “Like the New York school system, Verizon was a victim of that fraud and five years ago helped to convict Lanham,” the company said. Government documents said the fraud may have lasted from as long as 2002 through 2008, but Verizon was only charged in a federal civil complaint with filing a fraudulent bill in 2006.  The government cited a New York City Department of Education investigative report that said Lanham was responsible for significant fraud, creating a subcontracting scheme through which he billed millions of dollars to the city school department for consultants he employed without the city or Verizon’s knowledge.  Lanham “manipulated bills Verizon sent” to the department, the FCC said. In December 2015, the department agreed to pay $3 million to resolve the FCC investigation. The department, which has approximately 1.1 million students in over 1,800 schools, has received approximately $1.3 billion in E-rate program payments since 1998. As part of the FCC settlement, Verizon will operate under a compliance plan for three years. It also agreed to surrender any appeal rights to more than $100 million in E-rate subsidy payments.  FCC chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement that the settlement was an “important measure that both enforces our rules and restores critical taxpayer dollars” to the Universal Service Fund, a government fund that provides subsidies for telecommunications services. Democratic FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn said in a statement the incident caused “over $50 million of harm to the Universal Service Fund” and said the FCC settled “for a fraction of that harm.” ",10172017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-verizon-fcc/verizon-to-pay-17-7-million-to-resolve-school-broadband-probe-idUSKBN1CM33O
1428,VZ,Univision appeals to regulator after Verizon pulls the plug,"(Reuters) - Spanish language broadcaster Univision Communications Inc [UVN.UL] has sent a letter to the U.S. media regulator lambasting Verizon Communications Inc for pulling Univision’s networks from 4.7 million of its customers on Monday without warning. At 4:59 p.m. on Monday, two minutes before Univision’s carriage deal with Verizon was set to expire, Verizon pulled Univision’s channels from its fiber optic network service, called FiOs, and wireless platforms, the letter said. Verizon also refused to sign a contract extension that would have kept the networks on the air, according to the letter, which was sent by Univision Chief Executive Randy Falco to Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai on Tuesday and viewed by Reuters.  “In my 40 plus years in the business, I have never seen a distributor so precipitously reject an extension and abruptly cease negotiating with a broadcaster,” Falco wrote in the letter. “Verizon should resume good-faith negotiations immediately.” The letter did not specify what action Univision wanted the regulator to take.  In an emailed statement, Univision urged Verizon “to come back to the negotiating table so we can reach a fair deal.” Requests for comment to the FCC and Verizon were not immediately returned. In a statement on its website, Verizon told customers that Univision was asking for an “excessive price increase.” “While some customers are relying on coverage of the recent natural disasters in Puerto Rico and Mexico, Univision is proposing an increase of more than double what they charge for access to their channels today,” it said. Negotiations between pay-TV operators and programmers have become increasingly difficult as more viewers become “cord cutters,” opting to watch their favorite shows online. Six of the largest U.S. pay-TV providers lost a total of 723,000 subscribers during the second quarter. Viacom Inc and Charter Communications are still in negotiations over a contract that was initially set to expire on Sunday evening.  Viacom, whose networks include Comedy Central and MTV, have warned the 16.6 million subscribers of Charter’s Spectrum service that they could lose the channels. And earlier this month, Walt Disney Co and cable operator Altice USA finalized a multi-year programming agreement, following contentious negotiations.  However, it is unusual for a programmer to have its networks taken off the air without any warning. “You have entered a period where video subscribers to the bundle are falling and bundles are getting smaller and advertising is under pressure,” said Rich Greenfield, an industry analyst with BTIG.

1431,VZ,Verizon quarterly revenue tops estimates as subscribers rise,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc’s (VZ.N) quarterly revenue topped Wall Street analyst estimates on Thursday and the company added more phone subscribers than expected, sending shares of the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier up in mid-morning trading. Verizon has struggled to fend off smaller rivals T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) and Sprint Corp (S.N) in a mature market for wireless service.  AT&T; Inc (T.N), its No. 2 competitor, plans to diversify its revenues with an $85.4-billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), a deal that, if approved by regulators, would give it ownership of premium content like HBO.    Verizon maintains it does not need to do a large content acquisition. “Just through licensing content, we can have access to content that we want to distribute to our customers,” Chief Financial Officer Matthew Ellis said in an interview.  He said Verizon was continuing to work on a deal for content rights referenced by Chief Executive Officer Lowell McAdam at an investor conference in September but declined to comment on the type of content or partner. Verizon said that it added 274,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill on a net basis. Churn, or rate of defections for all customers paying a monthly bill, including tablet subscribers, was 0.97 percent.  Wells Fargo analysts had expected subscriber additions of 185,000 and churn of 1.05 percent. They said in an earlier note that the quarter was relatively less competitive, with consumers pushing out decisions to switch carriers until the fourth quarter when Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) iPhone X is expected to debut. New phone launches typically give customers incentive to upgrade plans and change service providers.  Verizon shares, part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI, rose 2.4 percent to $49.82. Verizon also said it lost 18,000 video subscribers in the third quarter, citing a shift from traditional pay-TV packages to cheaper streaming services. Other companies have pointed to the trend, saying it contributed to a more competitive environment during the period.   Revenues in its Oath media business, which includes AOL and Yahoo, were $2 billion in the first full quarter to include both internet businesses.   Net income attributable to Verizon was $3.62 billion, or 89 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, flat from the year earlier period.  Excluding items, earnings per share was 98 cents.

1439,VZ,"Gorilla Glass fuels Corning's profit, revenue beat","(Reuters) - Corning Inc (GLW.N) posted its sixth straight quarter of profit and revenue beat as demand remained strong for its flagship Gorilla Glass used in smartphones and its fiber optic products from telecom companies looking to upgrade their networks. The company’s shares rose as much as 6.6 percent to a three-month high of $32 on Tuesday. Demand for Gorilla Glass, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary, has surged as smartphone makers expand its use and also from increased adoption in the automotive market.  “Corning looks to be riding on the shoulders of Gorilla Glass over the next year which will benefit the top and bottom line,” said Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer at research firm GBH Insights. Earnings from the company’s specialty materials unit, which makes the Gorilla Glass, surged 71.4 percent to $71 million in the third quarter. Corning is also reaping rich rewards as U.S. telecom companies revamp their network infrastructure to improve coverage and to speed up 5G technology deployments.  No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier Verizon (VZ.N) in April signed a deal worth at least $1.05 billion with Corning to buy optical fiber over the next three years. Revenue from Corning’s optical communications division, which makes fiber optic products, rose about 15 percent to $917 million, beating estimates of $895.7 million, according to research firm FactSet. The unit’s profit climbed 21.4 percent to $102 million.  “During the quarter, we achieved an exciting milestone – 1 billion fiber kilometers sold,” CEO Wendell Weeks said. Net income attributable to Corning rose to $390 million, or 39 cents per share, from $284 million, or 26 cents per share, a year earlier. The Corning, New York-based company reported core earnings of 43 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of 41 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

1444,VZ,"SoftBank, Deutsche Telekom hit wall in Sprint, T-Mobile talks: sources","(Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp and Deutsche Telekom AG have reached an impasse in their talks to merge Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc, sources said, sending shares in the Japanese Internet giant sliding. At a SoftBank board meeting on Friday, several directors expressed doubts about giving up control of Sprint, people familiar with the matter told Reuters, the latest twist in on-and-off talks to unite the two U.S. wireless carriers that began earlier this summer. One person briefed on the deal said SoftBank was moving toward breaking off the talks. SoftBank declined to comment. According to tentative deal terms that Reuters was first to report last month, SoftBank and other Sprint shareholders would have received close to 40 percent or a little more of the combined company. If talks fall apart, it would be the second time an attempted merger of Sprint and T-Mobile, controlled by Deutsche Telekom, has failed. Together, they would have more than 130 million U.S. subscribers, behind Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T; Inc. The two companies came close to announcing a merger in 2014, but called it off at the last minute due to regulatory concerns. Failure to clinch an agreement could also damage the dealmaking credentials of SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son, who has raised close to $100 billion for his Vision Fund to invest in technology companies, and uses his image as a reliable counterparty to clinch deals.  SoftBank shares were down 5 percent in Tuesday afternoon trade after rising around 15 percent in the past month, helped by hopes of a deal. Industry watchers had long expected Sprint and T-Mobile to attempt another deal, especially after a quiet period associated with a U.S. government auction of wireless airwaves concluded in April, freeing up companies in the telecom industry to discuss mergers and acquisitions.  But no deal was announced immediately following the conclusion of the restriction on merger talks, and both Sprint and T-Mobile said they were open to exploring other options. A source told Reuters in July that SoftBank was considering an acquisition offer for Charter Communications Inc in a deal where it would combine the cable company with Sprint. Sprint is in the middle of a turnaround plan and has sought to strengthen its balance sheet by cutting costs. But industry analysts have expressed concern that the company, weighed down with total debt of $38 billion, has few financial options. Even though its customer base has expanded under CEO Marcelo Claure, growth has been driven by heavy discounting. Sprint’s junk bonds were among the hardest hit in Monday afternoon trading, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters capital markets news service. Claure said in August that while Sprint could sustain itself, cost savings from a transaction were significantly better than remaining a standalone entity. Analysts have estimated a deal could result in more than $30 billion in savings. Sprint shares fell as much as 13 percent on Monday after the Nikkei business daily first reported that SoftBank had doubts about a deal, and ended down 9.3 percent. T-Mobile shares ended down 5.4 percent.  The Nikkei also reported that SoftBank would inform Germany’s Deutsche Telekom as early as Tuesday that it was proposing to call off the deal talks, but sources who spoke to Reuters could not confirm this. As of late Monday, T-Mobile still considered the negotiations with Sprint to be active, according to the sources.  Sprint, T-Mobile, Deutsche Telekom also declined to comment. The due diligence between T-Mobile and Sprint was almost complete as of last week, and the focus had shifted to working out a business plan for the combined company as well as an integration strategy, sources had told Reuters. Even so, it was not clear that U.S. regulators would clear a deal between the two carriers. Analysts have expected consolidation in the U.S. wireless industry to ease pricing pressure in the market, which could benefit AT&T; and Verizon, who have lost share to their smaller rivals. Cable companies Comcast Corp and Charter Communications are also entering the market with wireless service on Verizon’s airwaves. “With no merger of Sprint and T-Mobile, as well as the entrance of Comcast and Charter into wireless, we expect Verizon to have a difficult run going forward,” said Philip Cusick, an analyst at JPMorgan, in a research note. Verizon shares closed down 2.1 percent. “Sprint as well could struggle to maintain positive subscriber momentum as cable enters, making its balance sheet look unsustainable.” Shares in satellite television provider Dish Network Corp, which has been widely considered a potential partner for T-Mobile or Sprint because of its spectrum holdings, closed up 4 percent.

1446,VZ,"UPDATE 1-Qualcomm, JMC seek to exit Alphabet-backed New York WiFi project -sources","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc and private equity firm JMC Capital Partners are looking to sell their stakes in a joint venture that operates more than 1,300 free WiFi kiosks fashioned from old phone booths around New York City, according to people familiar with the matter. The move is the latest twist in the project overseen by Daniel Doctoroff, former chief executive of news and data provider Bloomberg LP and former deputy mayor of New York City. He now runs Sidewalk Labs, an urban development unit of Google parent Alphabet Inc. Doctoroff is chairman of a Sidewalk Labs subsidiary that is the top investor in the joint venture. Qualcomm and JMC are working with an investment bank to explore the sale of their stakes in CityBridge, the venture that is behind the LinkNYC WiFi project, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Qualcomm is seeking to exit the venture because it views it as non-core, while the private equity firm JMC is aiming to generate a profitable return on its investment, the people said.  Qualcomm and Sidewalk Labs declined to comment. JMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jovana Rizzo, a spokesperson for CityBridge, said in a statement that the group is “committed to fulfilling its obligation to the city of New York and continuing the expansion of LinkNYC across the five boroughs.” A spokeswoman for New York City’s Information Technology & Telecommunications Department said in a statement that the city would have to approve any changes and so far “nothing has been presented to us. Any decision we make has to center around continuing the success of the program and ensuring New Yorkers’ best interests are met.” LinkNYC emerged in 2014 as part of a 12-year contract with New York City to replace 7,500 payphone stands and was expected to generate $500 million in revenue for the city’s coffers.  The program’s launch in February 2016 prompted complaints from business owners and residents about crowds hanging around the hotspots for hours at a time and users browsing online pornography on kiosk screens. LinkNYC removed the web-browsing feature. More than 2.7 million people have registered to use the kiosks, which also have phone charging stations and free calling services, LinkNYC said Wednesday. LinkNYC kiosks generate revenue through ad sales.  Qualcomm and JMC each invested about $25 million into the joint venture in 2014, the sources said. Another $50 million came from an outdoor advertising company and a software firm that were later bought by a consortium led by Sidewalk Labs and merged in 2015 under the name Intersection. Sidewalk Labs remains the lead investor. Sidewalk Labs, which already owns more half of the CityBridge joint venture through Intersection, could be a potential acquirer of the stakes, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. Sidewalk Labs declined to comment on its potential interest. Large wireless carriers such as Verizon Communications and AT&T; could potentially be good partners as well in the joint venture, according to the sources. Verizon and AT&T; could not immediately be reached for comment.  Sidewalk Labs’ Intersection expanded its network of Internet kiosks to London in June, turning on the first of 1,000 expected to be installed with Britain broadband provider BT and a local advertising firm. On Wednesday, Intersection announced plans to open 100 kiosks in Philadelphia without any business partners starting next year.

1449,VZ,"UPDATE 4-Former Yahoo CEO apologizes for data breaches, blames Russians","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer apologized on Wednesday for two massive data breaches at the internet company, blaming Russian agents for at least one of them, at a hearing on the growing number of cyber attacks on major U.S. companies. “As CEO, these thefts occurred during my tenure, and I want to sincerely apologize to each and every one of our users,” she told the Senate Commerce Committee, testifying alongside the interim and former CEOs of Equifax Inc (EFX.N) and a senior Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) executive.  “Unfortunately, while all our measures helped Yahoo successfully defend against the barrage of attacks by both private and state-sponsored hackers, Russian agents intruded on our systems and stole our users’ data.” Verizon, the largest U.S. wireless operator, acquired most of Yahoo Inc’s assets in June, the same month Mayer stepped down. Verizon disclosed last month that a 2013 Yahoo data breach affected all 3 billion of its accounts, compared with an estimate of more than 1 billion disclosed in December. In March, federal prosecutors charged two Russian intelligence agents and two hackers with masterminding a 2014 theft of 500 million Yahoo accounts, the first time the U.S. government has criminally charged Russian spies for cyber crimes. Those charges came amid controversy relating to alleged Kremlin-backed hacking of the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible links between Russian figures and associates of President Donald Trump. Russia has denied trying to influence the U.S. election in any way. Special Agent Jack Bennett of the FBI’s San Francisco Division said in March the 2013 breach was unrelated and that an investigation of the larger incident was continuing. Mayer later said under questioning that she did not know if Russians were responsible for the 2013 breach, but earlier spoke of state-sponsored attacks.  Senator John Thune, a Republican who chairs the Commerce Committee, asked Mayer on Wednesday why it took three years to identify the data breach or properly gauge its size.  Mayer said Yahoo has not been able to identify how the 2013 intrusion occurred and that the company did not learn of the incident until the U.S. government presented data to Yahoo in November 2016. She said even “robust” defenses are not enough to defend against state-sponsored attacks and compared the fight with hackers to an “arms race.” Yahoo required users to change passwords and took new steps to make data more secure, Mayer said. “We now know that Russian intelligence officers and state-sponsored hackers were responsible for highly complex and sophisticated attacks on Yahoo’s systems,” Mayer said. She said “really aggressive” pursuit of hackers was needed to discourage the efforts, and that even the most well-defended companies “could fall victim to these crimes.” The current and former chief executives of credit bureau Equifax, which disclosed in September that a data breach affected as many as 145.5 million U.S. consumers, said they did not know who was responsible for the attack.   Senator Bill Nelson said “only stiffer enforcement and stringent penalties will help incentivize companies to properly safeguard consumer information.” Thune told reporters after the hearing the Equifax data breach had created “additional momentum” for Congress to approve legislation. He said Mayer’s testimony was “important in shaping our future reactions.” The Senate Commerce Committee took the unusual step of subpoenaing Mayer to testify on Oct. 25 after a representative for Mayer declined multiple requests for her voluntarily testimony. A representative for Mayer said on Tuesday she was appearing voluntarily.

The U.S. cell tower market is currently dominated by three companies: American Tower Corp, SBA Communications Corp, and Crown Castle International Corp.  The agreement announced on Monday shows that Verizon and AT&T;, the No. 1 and No. 2 biggest U.S. wireless carriers, are willing to strike deals with other vendors to secure better prices for the towers they use to transmit wireless signals, analysts and company officials said.  Both carriers are seeking to add to their network capacity at a time when consumers are using increasing amounts of cellular data.  Carriers are “always looking for alternative partners to lessen their dependence on the big three guys,” said Jonathan Chaplin, analyst at New Street Research.  As part of the agreement, Tillman will construct the towers and AT&T; and Verizon will serve as anchor tenants. Construction will begin in the first quarter of 2018.  “This is Verizon and AT&T; working together with a new provider to put some competition into the mix,” said Susan Johnson, AT&T;’s senior vice president of supply chain, in an interview, adding, “we do really hope this will be a future model.” Shares of American Tower were flat in afternoon trading, while shares of SBA Communications were down 1.9 percent and Crown Castle was down 0.3 percent.

1462,VZ,Verizon plan to launch 5G broadband lifts shares,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) shares rose 2 percent in midday trading on Thursday after the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier said it would launch next-generation high-speed Internet services in three to five U.S. markets in 2018.  The company said on Wednesday it had successfully tested its 5G broadband service in 11 markets this year and that its first commercial launch was planned for Sacramento, California, in the second half of 2018. 5G is expected to offer faster speeds and response times, and higher capacity. Both Verizon and rival AT&T; Inc (T.N) have been testing faster broadband services, where the last leg of the connection is delivered via a radio signal to a home or business using high-band wireless airwaves known as millimeter wave. Verizon shares were up 2.1 percent at $50.96. The service, called fixed wireless, is considered to be the first application of 5G technology and could eventually be a competitor to the high-speed Internet services offered by cable companies. Verizon said it estimates the market opportunity for initial 5G residential broadband services to be about 30 million households nationwide. Shares of cable companies Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) and Altice USA Inc (ATUS.N) were down 2.6 percent and 3.7 percent, respectively. Shares of Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), the largest U.S. cable provider, fell 0.3 percent.

Under the partnership, Verizon renews its agreement to stream NFL games on its mobile devices but loses its exclusive rights to the airings. Representatives from Verizon and the NFL declined to comment on the financial terms of the deal but the No.1 U.S. wireless carrier said the deal will go into effect in January with streaming of NFL playoff games on Yahoo and Yahoo Sports, in addition to the go90 streaming platform and the NFL mobile app. The partnership will also include mobile access to jointly-developed original content, Verizon said. Jennifer Fritzsche, analyst at Wells Fargo, said in a research note that the deal shows how Verizon is trying to expand its mobile advertising platform. In June, Verizon bought Yahoo’s core assets for $4.48 billion and combined it with AOL to form its Oath business.  “With the recent consolidation of these properties in the Oath division, we would expect this to take on more of a growing focus for (Verizon) in 2018,” Fritzsche said.  Verizon estimates that it reaches more than 200 million U.S. monthly unique mobile and digital users. The company has said its goal for Oath is to contribute $20 billion in revenue by 2020.

Walt Disney struck a deal to buy Twenty-First Century Fox’s assets for $52.4 billion in stock. Fox rose 4.12 percent and Disney 2.2 percent, boosting the consumer discretionary sector by 0.5 percent. Other media stocks Netflix and Comcast were also higher. Gains in technology stocks Alphabet and Facebook lifted the Nasdaq up 0.15 percent to 6,886.32. Healthcare stocks were the biggest laggards, led by a 0.7 percent fall in Johnson & Johnson and 1.3 percent fall in AbbVie. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.04 percent at 24,594.28, while the S&P; 500 was down 0.02 percent, at 2,662.32. Indexes were still hovering near record levels on optimism over the progress in Republican-led tax overhaul and the Federal Reserve’s economic growth projection. A final tax bill could be unveiled by Friday, with decisive votes expected next week in both chambers. The Fed on Wednesday raised interest rate by a quarter-percentage-point for the third time in 2017 and raised its 2018 economic growth forecast to 2.5 percent from 2.1 percent. “Talks on tax reforms and the Fed announcement brings confidence in the fact that the economy is still moving in a positive and sustained fashion,” said Paul Springmeyer, investment managing director at U.S. Bank Private Wealth Management. “You’ve seen some M&A; activity hit the screens that is driving some interest as well - that’s a three-legged soul that’s moving the market.” Growth outlook was also bolstered by data that showed a better-than-expected increase in U.S. retail sales in November.

The Fed now expects a burst of growth fueled by tax cuts and ultra-low unemployment of below 4 percent in 2018 and 2019, though little movement on inflation. A final bill could be unveiled by Friday, with decisive votes expected next week in both chambers. Congressional Republicans reached a deal on final tax legislation on Wednesday that would slash the corporate tax rate to 21 percent. “Talks on tax reforms and the Fed announcement brings confidence in the fact that the economy is still moving in a positive and sustained fashion,” said Paul Springmeyer, investment managing director at U.S. Bank Private Wealth Management. Shares of big banks recovered from an initial decline after the Federal Reserve raised rates by 25 basis points but kept its outlook for 2018 and 2019 unchanged. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Bank of America rose by between 0.76 percent and 1.51 percent, pushing up the S&P; financial index 0.38 percent. “You’ve seen some M&A; activity hit the screens that is driving some interest as well - that’s a three-legged soul that’s moving the market.” Walt Disney Co struck a deal to buy film, television and international businesses from Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox for $52.4 billion in stock. Disney’s shares inched up 0.12 percent in volatile trading and Fox shares rose 3 percent.

Verizon said it took down the news network last month because it did not want to pay for it when viewers can access it for free online. It remained unclear whether the companies could come to an agreement allowing the network to return to Verizon’s customers.  “Bloomberg is proposing that we pay for content that they make available to all consumers for free on their website and mobile app,” the company said in its alert to Verizon’s FIOS TV customers about the removal of Bloomberg TV.  Verizon is advising customers to go to Bloomberg’s website and app to watch Bloomberg TV, a Verizon spokeswoman said.  A spokesman for Bloomberg declined to comment. Cable and satellite companies have been losing more subscribers, making them much less willing to pay up for television programing that is also available online. Six U.S. cable providers, including Verizon, lost more than 1.6 million subscribers through the third quarter of 2017. Verizon is one of a growing number of distributors that are using a new negotiating tactic with programmers by referring customers to the programmers’ own streaming services. This week, Altice USA Inc, advised customers to sign up for Starz’ online streaming service after it pulled its channels from 3.4 million of its customers. Meanwhile, Bloomberg has been focused on expanding its online viewership. In December it launched a 24/7 news service with Twitter to reach the microblogging service’s 330 million active users.

1476,VZ,Internet Association to join expected net neutrality lawsuit,"WASHINGTON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - The Internet Association, a trade group representing companies such as Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc, said on Friday it intends to join an expected lawsuit against a decision to roll back net neutrality rules. Several states including New York, and public interest advocacy groups have said they intend to sue to stop the mid-December ruling by the Federal Communications Commission. The approval of FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s proposal in a 3-2 vote marked a victory for internet service providers such as AT&T; Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc, handing them power over what content consumers can access. Democrats, Hollywood and companies such as Google parent Alphabet and Facebook had urged Pai, a Republican appointed by U.S. President Donald Trump, to keep the Obama-era rules barring service providers from blocking, slowing access to or charging more for certain content. “The final version of Chairman Pai’s rule, as expected, dismantles popular net neutrality protections for consumers. This rule defies the will of a bipartisan majority of Americans and fails to preserve a free and open internet,” the Internet Association said in a statement. The new rules give internet service providers sweeping powers to change how consumers access the internet but must have new transparency requirements that will require them to disclose any changes to consumers. Internet Association members also include Airbnb, Etsy Inc, Amazon.com and several dozen online and social media companies.

1480,VZ,"Verizon quarterly revenue, subscribers beat estimates","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) on Tuesday reported quarterly revenue that exceeded analyst estimates as it added phone subscribers, and the company’s chief executive said it was not currently considering a large media acquisition. Analysts have wondered whether Verizon, the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier, will buy a media company as its rival AT&T; Inc (T.N) tries to close on an $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc (TWX.N). The U.S. Department of Justice sued to block that deal late last year.  “I can say unequivocally, there is nothing going on right now with us considering a large media play,” Verizon Chief Executive Lowell McAdam said on a post-earnings conference call, adding that “being independent is a very good place to play for us right now.”    Verizon also said a tax-overhaul bill signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump late last year would boost cash flow from operations in 2018 by about $3.5 billion to $4 billion. McAdam said on the call that Verizon would provide more details on how it is investing in employees. Later on Tuesday, he told CNBC that Verizon’s non-executive employees, numbering about 155,000, will each get 50 shares of restricted stock.   When asked on CNBC about chipmaker Broadcom Ltd’s (AVGO.O) takeover attempt of rival Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), one of Verizon’s partners on 5G, or fifth-generation technology, McAdam said “the most important thing is to keep the innovation engine and research and development organization intact” at Qualcomm. Analysts have said Broadcom would cut a big portion of Qualcomm’s R&D; budget if it was successful in acquiring the company. Verizon shares closed down 0.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange at $53.23. Net income attributable to Verizon was $18.7 billion, or $4.56 per share, in the fourth quarter through Dec. 31, up considerably from $4.5 billion, or $1.10 a share, a year earlier.  Excluding items such as the impact of the tax cuts, earnings per share were 86 cents. Total revenue rose to $34.0 billion from $32.34 billion a year earlier. According to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, analysts expected adjusted earnings per share of 88 cents on revenue of $33.26 billion. The company added 431,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill on a net basis. Analysts at Wells Fargo said in an earlier note that they expected 320,000.   Verizon added 47,000 Fios Internet connections in the quarter and lost 29,000 Fios video connections as consumers shifted to cheaper streaming services.  The company expects full-year revenue for 2018 to grow at a low single-digit percentage rate and service revenue growth to turn positive around the end of the year or early in 2019.  It also expects low single-digit percentage growth in adjusted earnings per share, excluding the impact of the tax reforms and a new accounting standard it has adopted.

1487,VZ,U.S. telco shares fall on 5G network reports despite skepticism,"Jan 29 (Reuters) - Shares in the biggest U.S. communications companies slipped on Monday after reports President Donald Trump’s national security team is considering building its own 5G high-speed wireless network. While investors fled, regulators and analysts scorned the proposal, which is being considered as a way to counter the threat of China spying on U.S. phone calls, according to U.S. media reports. Shares in wireless providers Verizon Communications, AT&T; Inc, Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US fell more 1 percent before paring losses. Even Comcast Corp , a provider of cable television and landline internet services, was last down 1.4 percent. Charter Communications was down 0.8 percent. But Moffett Nathanson analyst Craig Moffett said Monday’s dip was a buying opportunity for telecom stocks. “The story is utterly ridiculous. Investors shouldn’t spend three seconds worrying that this has even the remotest chance of becoming a national policy,” said Moffett, adding that it was economically and politically infeasible and has no legal basis. Moffett said the only real thing that will come of the plan is a continuation of efforts to prohibit equipment from China’s Huawei. This month AT&T; had to scrap a plan to sell Huawei phones. In 2012 the United States probed whether Chinese network gear provided an opportunity for foreign espionage. JPMorgan analyst Philip Cusick said construction would likely take longer than three years and that the idea of a national 5G network “seems to be in preliminary stages, and likely won’t go any further.” Even the top U.S. telecommunications regulators said they were against the idea. The Federal Communications Commission chairman said he would oppose such a move, calling it “costly and counterproductive.” Another FCC commissioner Michael O’Reilly called the proposal “nonsensical.” Cusick said there are other ways the U.S. government could help bolster U.S. network development. “In our view the best thing the government could do to get 5G networks up faster would be to allocate more spectrum to them,” for commercial operators looking to upgrade their networks, Cusick said. But New Street Research analyst Blair Levin gave the idea some credence saying “the existence of the plan means that all investments in incumbent ISPs (internet service providers) are a bet on whether, how and to what extent, the plan succeeds.” AT&T; shares were last down 0.7 percent. Verizon was down 0.8 percent. Sprint was down 0.8 percent. T-Mobile was down 1.1 percent. In comparison the S&P; 500 fell 0.3 percent.

1490,VZ,UPDATE 4-Dish says Sling TV has 2.2 million subscribers,"(Reuters) - Dish Network Corp (DISH.O) said on Wednesday its online streaming service, Sling TV, added 160,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter, disclosing numbers for the first time and providing an overall figure of 2.21 million. Dish has been losing customers as they move away from satellite TV packages to online streaming services such as Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) Prime Video. The total subscribers for Sling pales in comparison with Netflix’s about 118 million worldwide or Amazon Prime Video’s 40 million, but they have been accumulated from scratch in just two years at a time when other cable TV providers are struggling. At a post-earnings call with analysts on Wednesday, Chairman Charlie Ergen responding to a question on slower growth for Sling TV said he was not worried about that, but did note that monthly churn is high across all the online streaming services as many people sign up for free trials and then cancel. Dish had 14 million subscribers in January 2015 when it launched Sling TV at $20 per month to target younger consumers avoiding pricey cable and satellite subscriptions. However, the company posted a loss of another 121,000 subscribers for Dish TV in the fourth quarter and said revenue from its total 13.24 million users of both services fell. Jefferies analyst Scott Goldman said Dish’s average revenue per user of $84.63 was below his estimate of $85.71 and Wall Street estimate of $86.10. New Street Research analyst Jonathan Chaplin said the results were “not great”, but that the primary value of the satellite business is to provide cash flow while Ergen seeks to monetize the rights it has accumulated to radio frequencies. Dish has spent billions buying up wireless airwaves, or spectrum, in recent years, making it a potential acquisition target for U.S. wireless carriers. The company faces a Federal Communications Commission deadline of 2021 to build its first wireless network.  Thomas Cullen, executive vice president of corporate development, told a post-earnings call that the company expects to spend up to $1 billion to complete Phase I of the network by March 2020. Dish’s revenue fell 7.2 percent in the fourth quarter to $3.48 billion, missing analysts’ average estimate of $3.53 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company’s shares were down 1.4 percent at $43.93 in afternoon trade. Dish added about 39,000 pay-TV subscriber on a net basis in the quarter, including 75,000 reactivations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands that were removed after Hurricane Maria. Net income jumped to $1.39 billion from $355 million a year earlier due to a $1.2 billion benefit related to U.S. tax law reforms. Excluding that and other one-time items, Dish earned 57 cents per share, topping analysts’ estimates by 2 cents.

The carpooling start-up Splitting Fares Inc, whose app connects people who share the same route to their place of work or study, will be part of Bosch’s new Connected Mobility Solutions division, the world’s largest automotive supplier said.

1493,VZ,Groups refile lawsuits to block net neutrality reversal,"WASHINGTON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Web browser developer Mozilla Corp and video-sharing website Vimeo Inc said on Thursday they had refiled legal challenges intended to block the Trump administration’s repeal of landmark net neutrality rules from taking effect. A coalition of more than 20 state attorneys general led by New York’s Eric Schneiderman separately plans to refile a legal challenge as early as today. The Federal Communications Commission officially published its order overturning net neutrality rules in the Federal Register on Thursday, a procedural step that allows for the filing of legal challenges. The Republican-led FCC in December voted 3-2 to overturn rules barring service providers from blocking, slowing access to or charging more for certain content. The White House Office of Management and Budget still must sign off on some aspects of the FCC reversal before it takes legal effect and that could take months. Congressional aides say the publication will trigger a 60-legislative-day deadline for Congress to vote on whether to overturn the decision. U.S. Senate Democrats have the backing of 50 members of the 100-person chamber for repeal, leaving them just one vote short of a majority. Even if Democrats could win a majority in the Senate, reinstatement of net neutrality would also require a favorable vote in the House of Representatives, where Republicans hold a larger majority, and would still be subject to a likely veto by President Donald Trump. Democrats need 51 votes to win any proposal in the Republican-controlled Senate because Vice President Mike Pence can break any tie. On Friday, a coalition of more than 20 state attorneys general and advocacy groups agreed to withdraw a protective petition filed in January that sought to preserve the right to sue. Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, said last week the office agreed to withdraw “the original petition and will simply refile it once the final rule is published. Either way, our coalition of AGs is taking the FCC to court to challenge its illegal rollback of net neutrality.” The repeal was a victory for internet service providers like AT&T; Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc, conferring power over what content consumers can access. Technology companies including Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc have thrown their weight behind the congressional bid to reverse the FCC December vote.

1495,VZ,U.S. Senate Democrats push for support to reinstate net neutrality,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democrats launched efforts on Tuesday to win a vote to reinstate Obama-era rules guaranteeing an open internet, suggesting it would be a major issue in the 2018 mid-term elections. Democrats remain one Republican senator shy of winning a majority in the Senate to reverse the Federal Communications Commission’s order to undo the 2015 open internet rules. Even then the effort would not likely pass the Republican-controlled House of Representatives or survive a veto by President Donald Trump.  The FCC in December voted 3-2 to reverse Obama-era rules barring service providers from blocking, slowing access to or charging more for certain online content.  The new FCC rules, once effective, would give internet service providers sweeping powers to change how consumers access the internet but include new transparency requirements that require them to disclose any changes to consumers. Last week, a coalition of 22 state attorneys general refiled legal challenges intended to block the Trump administration’s repeal of net neutrality. The FCC published its order overturning net neutrality last week, a procedural step that allows for the filing of legal challenges. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has said often he is confident the order will be upheld. The repeal of the net neutrality rules was a victory for internet service providers like AT&T; Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc, conferring power over what content consumers can access. On the other side, technology companies including Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc have thrown their weight behind the congressional bid to reverse the repeal.    Democrats said on Tuesday that the issue would be big in the mid-term election, especially among younger internet-savvy voters.     New York Senator Charles Schumer, the Democratic leader, suggested that under the FCC’s approach internet providers could block a young couple from watching Netflix programming or a college student watching an educational video. Schumer said Americans should blame Republicans for slow internet service “while Democrats fought to fix it.”  Republicans have said the FCC vote would eliminate heavy-handed government regulations, encourage investment and return the internet to pre-2015 rules. Under Senate rules, the earliest the Senate could vote on the issue is March 15 and they must seek a vote by June 20. Senator Edward Markey, the chief sponsor, said Democrats are undecided on when they would force a vote. Democrats, who control 49 seats in the 100-person chamber, have the backing of 50 senators for repeal, leaving them one vote short of a majority. Democrats need 51 votes to win any proposal in the Republican-controlled Senate because Vice President Mike Pence can break any tie.

1496,VZ,"Verizon, Straight Path pay $614 million civil penalty to U.S. FCC: statement","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and its Straight Path Communications Inc unit paid a $614 million civil penalty as part of a January 2017 settlement with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, the agency said on Wednesday. The telecommunications regulator said the settlement resolved an investigation into allegations that Straight Path failed to use the spectrum it was awarded, and in doing so violated the FCC’s rules in connection with approximately 1,000 licenses.  The settlement required Straight Path to sell those licenses and remit 20 percent of the overall proceeds. Verizon said on Wednesday it had completed its $3.1 billion acquisition of the company it announced in May 2017. The settlement represents the largest civil penalty paid to resolve an FCC investigation. A Verizon spokesman declined to comment. The settlement resolved conduct from before Verizon’s announced acquisition. The sales proceeds does not include a separate $15 million penalty that Straight Path paid to the FCC in January 2017. The licenses are important to emerging 5G technology that will allow for much faster wireless networks and could usher in advances like remote surgical procedures and self-driving vehicles. The FCC said in January 2017 that Straight Path was “squatting on spectrum licenses” and that was “fundamentally inconsistent with the public good.” The FCC probe was prompted by allegations of fraud in November 2015 by an anonymous short seller of the company’s stock, Reuters reported earlier. Verizon outbid AT&T; Inc (T.N), which made a bid to buy Straight Path in April 2017 valued at $1.6 billion.

1501,VZ,U.S. appeals court in San Francisco will hear net neutrality appeal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judicial panel said on Thursday that challenges to the Federal Communications Commission’s repeal of the Obama era open internet rules will be heard by an appeals court based in San Francisco.   The U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict litigation said it randomly selected the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court Nth circuit to hear the consolidated challenges. The FCC declined to comment on the decision.  A dozen challenges have been filed by 22 state attorneys general, public interest groups, internet companies, a California county and the state’s Public Utilities Commission seeking to block the Trump administration’s repeal of landmark rules designed to ensure a free and open internet from taking effect. The suits were filed in both the Ninth Circuit and District of Columbia appeals court.  Of the Ninth Circuit court’s 24 active judges, 18 were appointed by Democratic presidents and six by Republican President George W. Bush. There are six current vacancies and President Donald Trump has nominated two candidates. The FCC published its order overturning the net neutrality rules in the Federal Register on Feb. 22, a procedural step that allowed for the filing of legal challenges. The Republican-led FCC in December voted 3-2 to overturn 2015 rules barring service providers from blocking, slowing access to or charging more for certain content on the internet. Trump in January criticized opponents for filing cases in the Ninth Circuit and asserted in a tweet they “almost always” win before being reversed.  New York, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Pennsylvania are among the states challenging the decision, arguing the FCC cannot make “arbitrary and capricious” changes to existing policies and that it misinterpreted and disregarded “critical record evidence on industry practices and harm to consumers and businesses.” FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has said he is confident the order will be upheld.

1506,VZ,"Fox chose Disney over Comcast on regulatory, stock fears: filing","(Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O), which agreed in December to sell most of its assets to Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) for $52.4 billion, had previously rejected a bid from Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) over concerns about the regulatory risks and its stock value, a regulatory filing on Wednesday showed. The joint filing by Disney and Fox, which outlines the timeline of their negotiations, offers the most detailed insight yet into Fox’s thinking, as it goes head-to-head against Comcast, a U.S. cable operator, in its bid to acquire European pay-TV company Sky Plc (SKYB.L), in which Fox holds a 39 percent stake. Comcast announced in February it was working on a $31 billion bid that would top Fox’s deal for Sky. It has not made a new attempt to bid for the Fox assets after the Disney deal, so investors are keen for information on the hurdles that prevented an agreement between Fox and Comcast. The filing does not mention Comcast by name, but refers to it as Party B. Another bidder for the Fox assets, U.S. wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), is referred to as Party A. Verizon and Comcast representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Comcast on Nov. 14 offered to acquire most of Fox’s assets in an all-stock deal valued at $34.41 per share, the filings said. Fox ended up announcing an all-stock deal with Disney for $29.54 per share. Like Disney, Comcast sought to buy Fox’s entertainment networks, movie studios, television production and international assets, the documents show.  In the filing, Disney and Fox said the ongoing antitrust scrutiny of U.S. telecommunications provider AT&T; Inc’s (T.N) planned merger with media conglomerate Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) heightened concerns about potential regulatory hurdles to Comcast’s bid. The U.S. Department of Justice has sued AT&T; and Time Warner to thwart their deal, and the case is in court. The companies added that, unlike Disney, Comcast declined to offer a reverse deal termination fee, which would compensate Fox in the event that regulators stymied a deal. Disney offered a reverse termination fee of $2.5 billion.  The companies also said that Fox saw Disney’s stock as more valuable than Comcast’s, based on historic prices, and felt that a deal between Disney and Fox would generate greater long-term value. The Roberts family controls Comcast through a dual-class stock structure. Comcast’s proposal, on the other hand, would reduce the compensation offered to Fox shareholders in the event that asset sales were required to reassure antitrust regulators, increasing the potential risk to Fox shareholders, the filing said.  Verizon’s bid was rejected because it offered to acquire Fox at market value, without a meaningful premium, according to the filing.

1508,VZ,Telecom standards group puts new technology on hold in wake of U.S. probe,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A telecommunications standards organization - GSMA - said on Saturday it is delaying implementation of a new cellphone technology due to a U.S. government probe of alleged coordination between the group, AT&T; Inc (T.N) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) to hinder consumers from easily switching wireless carriers. GSMA said in a statement that the move to a global standard for eSIM technology is “on hold pending the completion of an investigation by the United States Department of Justice.”         At issue is a technology that could make carriers’ business more volatile. ESIM allows consumers to switch wireless providers without having to insert a new physical SIM card, an identifying microchip. That makes it easier to compare wireless networks and easily select a new service when desired. “This standard contains a wide range of features, including the option for the eSIM to be locked. In the United States, consumers would have this option; however, they would need to explicitly consent to this under specific commercial agreements with their mobile operator, for example when purchasing a subsidized device,” GSMA said. It added that it was cooperating fully with the Department of Justice. Verizon on Friday called the probe “much ado about nothing,” adding it has been working with the Justice Department for several months “regarding the inquiry,” according to spokesman Rich Young. AT&T; also indicated it was they are working with the Justice Department.      Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and other equipment makers have complained to the Justice Department about wireless carrier practices related to eSIM technology, two sources familiar with the matter said.

Verizon called the probe “much ado about nothing,” adding that it has been working with the Justice Department for several months “regarding the inquiry,” according to spokesman Rich Young. The New York Times reported on Friday that the Justice Department had opened an investigation about five months ago after at least one device maker and one wireless carrier filed formal complaints with the Justice Department. The Justice Department sent demands to AT&T;, Verizon and the GSMA, an industry standards-setting group, on efforts to thwart  eSIM.  Apple Inc and other equipment makers have complained to the Justice Department about wireless carrier practices related to eSIM technology, two sources familiar with the matter said. Apple declined to comment. “The reality is that we have a difference of opinion with a couple of phone equipment manufacturers regarding the development of e-SIM standards. Nothing more,” Verizon’s Young said. An AT&T; spokesman said in an email: “Along with other GSMA members, we have provided information to the government in response to their requests and will continue to work proactively within GSMA, including with those who might disagree with the proposed standards.” News of the probe comes at a critical time for AT&T; which is being sued by the Justice Department to stop its deal to buy media company Time Warner Inc. The U.S. government has argued in a trial that is nearing completion that the proposed deal would spur AT&T; to charge its pay TV rivals more for Time Warner content. However, Judge Richard Leon, who will decide if AT&T; will be allowed to buy Time Warner, is unlikely to consider a report of potential wrongdoing by the wireless giant because it is irrelevant to the merger trial under way in Washington, said Seth Bloom, a veteran of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division.     The Department of Justice and the GSMA, the telecommunications standard setting group, declined to comment on news of the investigation. Shares of AT&T; and Verizon dipped after the initial Times report, with AT&T; closing down 0.4 percent at $34.67, and Verizon ending off 1.1 percent, at $47.90. The person briefed on the matter told Reuters that other wireless operators potentially received inquiries from the government.  It is common practice for the Justice Department to send CIDs, the civil equivalent of a subpoena, to all major players in the industry because the agency wants evidence from companies that allegedly participate in any conspiracy as well as those outside of it, according to Ethan Glass, a former trial attorney with the Justice Department now at the law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP.  The source said the Obama administration had investigated similar claims in 2016 but did not take any action.

Consumer advocates support the idea of an electronic SIM card, which is in the process of being rolled out, since it allows phone owners to bargain hunt and contract with any network or to shift networks easily while traveling, said Feld. “I am very happy that the DOJ is taking its job as a cop on the beat very seriously,” said Feld.

1511,VZ,Verizon first-quarter results beat estimates,"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) reported better-than-expected first-quarter results on Tuesday as the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier lost fewer monthly phone subscribers than feared, and the company’s chief financial officer said it was continuing to explore a new video service. Shares of the company rose 1.8 percent to $49.55. Verizon lost 24,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill, while analysts expected it to lose 69,000 subscribers, according to financial and data analytics firm FactSet. Speaking on the post-earnings conference call, Verizon Chief Financial Officer Matthew Ellis said the company was not interested at this time in acquiring broadcast or cable networks, but continued to look at “over-the-top” options, or cheaper streaming video packages with fewer channels. Verizon was a bidder for Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) assets, which Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) is trying to buy for $52.4 billion. The company expects to have an overall product offering for consumers in the three to five markets where it plans to launch home 5G broadband later this year, and will add more content to Oath, its subsidiary that owns Yahoo! and AOL, Ellis said.  That could include news, sports, finance or entertainment content, Ellis said in an interview.  Analysts questioned whether Verizon had its sights on traditional media similar to AT&T; Inc (T.N), which is fighting in court against the U.S. Department of Justice to close its acquisition of Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), and while Ellis said the company would look at potential deals, it is not the main focus. Verizon instead expects to add to its distribution rights for digital content, Ellis said.  Net income attributable to Verizon rose to $4.55 billion, or $1.11 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31 from $3.45 billion, or 85 cents per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.17 per share. Total operating revenue rose to $31.77 billion from $29.81 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected adjusted earnings of $1.10 per share and revenue of $31.26 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Verizon added 66,000 Fios internet customers during the quarter and lost 22,000 Fios video subscribers.  Verizon’s first-quarter 2018 earnings per share included about 21 cents due to tax reform and accounting changes for revenue recognition.  The company said it expected savings from tax reform to generate a net $3.5 billion to $4 billion benefit to cash flow from operations in 2018, resulting in a 55 to 65 cent increase in 2018 earnings per share.

1519,VZ,UPDATE 2-U.S. commerce secretary says 5G priority for Trump administration,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. commerce secretary said on Tuesday that building a next-generation 5G mobile network was a priority for President Donald Trump’s administration, boosting the argument behind the proposed merger of wireless carriers Sprint Corp (S.N) and T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O). “I think the pitch that Sprint and T-Mobile are making is an interesting one, that their merger would propel Verizon and AT&T; into more active pursuit of 5G,” Wilbur Ross told CNBC. “Whoever pursues it, whoever does it, we’re very much in support of 5G. We need it. We need it for defense purposes, we need it for commercial purposes,” he added. T-Mobile and Sprint said on Sunday they had agreed on a $26 billion all-stock merger, capping four years of on-and-off talks between the third and fourth largest U.S. wireless carriers. Regulators are expected to grill the firms on how they will price their combined wireless offerings. T-Mobile, majority-owned by Deutsche Telekom AG (DTEGn.DE), and Sprint, controlled by Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T), said the combined company would invest $40 billion over the next three years to upgrade networks to accommodate 5G. The Federal Communications Commission said in February it planned new auctions of high-band spectrum starting later this year to speed the launch of next-generation 5G networks. Carriers have spent billions of dollars acquiring spectrum and are beginning to develop and test 5G networks, which are expected to be at least 100 times faster than current 4G networks and cut latency, or delays, to less than one-thousandth of a second from one-hundredth of a second in 4G, the FCC has said. Policymakers and mobile phone companies have said the next generation of wireless signals needs to be much faster and far more responsive to allow advanced technologies like virtual surgery or controlling machines remotely. Shares for Sprint closed down 3.6 percent, while T-Mobile was off 1.8 percent. T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere met with two FCC commissioners in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the merits of the deal. Democratic Senator Ed Markey called for a hearing on the proposed combined company that would have more than 120 million subscribers and be 42 percent-owned by Deutsche Telekom. “Without sufficient alternatives to the other two major wireless providers, consumers may be left with no option to switch to a provider offering better, more affordable services,” he said.

1520,VZ,U.S. Commerce Secretary says 5G priority for Trump administration,"WASHINGTON, May 1 (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Tuesday said building a next generation 5G mobile network was a priority for the Trump administration, boosting the argument behind wireless carriers Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc’s proposed deal. “I think the pitch that Sprint and T-Mobile are making is an interesting one, that their merger would propel Verizon and AT&T; into more active pursuit of 5G,” Ross told CNBC. “Whoever pursues it, whoever does it, we’re very much in support of 5G. We need it. We need it for defense purposes, we need it for commercial purposes,” he added.

1521,VZ,Verizon's Oath signs distribution deal with Samsung,"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc’s Oath Inc subsidiary has signed a deal to place four of its most popular apps on millions of Samsung devices across the U.S. and eventually globally, the company told Reuters on Tuesday. Under the terms of the deal, Oath’s Newsroom app, Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Finance and Go90 mobile video apps will be pre-populated on all Verizon Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ devices.  Oath’s deal with Samsung is part of an effort to get its content and partners’ ads in front of the growing number of TV viewers watching their favorite shows on mobile devices instead of through cable and satellite television, Oath’s chief executive officer, Tim Armstrong, told Reuters. “The amount of content consumption on phones is continuing to skyrocket and I think brands and consumers want more high quality content,” Armstrong said. The number of viewers who watch video on smartphones is expected to jump 8 percent by 2020 to 196.4 million, according to research firm eMarketer. Meanwhile, the number of TV watchers is expected to decrease more than half a percentage point to 295.9 million over the same period. The agreement will also allow advertisers to place “native ads,” or advertisements that blend in with the content where they appear, within Oath’s apps as well as Samsung’s Galaxy app. “This gets ads one step closer to being direct to consumer,” Armstrong said. “You can’t be more direct than being on the mobile phone home screen and app environment.”  Samsung and Oath will share ad revenue, Armstrong said, declining to comment on the terms of the deal.  Nine-month-old Oath was created after Verizon bought Yahoo and merged it with AOL. Oath plans to announce its deal with Samsung as part of its presentation to media buyers in New York Tuesday evening, outlining its strategy for the year.

1527,VZ,U.S. Senate to vote to reinstate open internet rules,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate is set to vote in the coming week on rejecting the Federal Communications Commission decision in December to repeal Obama-era rules guaranteeing an open internet. Proponents currently have the backing of 47 Democrats and two independents who caucus with Democrats as well as Republican Senator Susan Collins. With the prolonged absence of Senator John McCain due to illness, proponents believe they will win on a 50-49 vote. Senate Democrats on Wednesday will officially file petition to force a net neutrality vote and 10 hours of floor debate under the Congressional Review Act. Advocates believe the Senate will vote before the end of next week. The FCC in December voted 3-2 to reverse Obama-era rules barring service providers from blocking, slowing access to or charging more for certain online content. The new FCC rules, once effective, would give internet service providers sweeping powers to change how consumers access the internet but include new transparency requirements that require them to disclose any changes to consumers. The FCC has not yet disclosed when the new rules will be effective, but officials have said the commission will likely give at least 30 days notice before the rules officially take effect. The FCC could soon formally publish the effective date in the coming days, officials say. If the Senate approves the measure, the measure would not likely pass the Republican-controlled House of Representatives or survive a veto by President Donald Trump. In February, a coalition of 22 state attorneys general refiled legal challenges intended to block the Trump administration’s repeal of net neutrality.  FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has said often he is confident the order will be upheld. The repeal of the net neutrality rules was a victory for internet service providers like AT&T; Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc, conferring power over what content consumers can access. On the other side, technology companies including Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc have thrown their weight behind the congressional bid to reverse the repeal. Democrats have repeatedly said they believe the issue would be big in the mid-term election, especially among younger internet-savvy voters. Republicans have said the FCC vote would eliminate heavy-handed government regulations, encourage investment and return the internet to pre-2015 rules.

1528,VZ,U.S. to reveal winners of drone program that has attracted top companies,"(Reuters) - Major technology and aerospace companies including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Intel Corp (INTC.O), Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) and Airbus SE (AIR.PA) are vying to take part in a new slate of drone tests the United States is set to announce on Wednesday, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. The wide interest in the U.S. initiative, launched by President Donald Trump last year, underscores the desire of a broad range of companies to have a say in how the fledgling industry is regulated and ultimately win authority to operate drones for everything from package delivery to crop inspection. The pilot program will allow a much larger range of tests than are generally permitted by federal aviation regulators,  including flying drones at night, over people and beyond an operator’s line of sight. The U.S. Transportation Department said it will announce 10 winning state, local or tribal governments to host the experiments on Wednesday. The governments in turn have partnered with companies who will play a role in the tests. Senator Dean Heller of Nevada, who is up for re-election in November, said in a press release the city of Reno was named one of the winners. The city is partnered with Nevada-based Flirtey, a company that has worked on delivering defibrillators by drone, as well as pizza for Domino’s. At least 200 companies spanning 149 applications are vying to be part of the program, a U.S. official said. Many major U.S. companies are part of the winning submissions. Winners include projects focused on package delivery, environmental monitoring, precision agriculture, pipeline oversight and integrating drones near airports, the U.S. official said.   Companies such as Boeing Co (BA.N) and Ford Motor Co (F.N) have also expressed interest in the program, sources said, though it was unclear whether they had joined applications and what they would be testing. Amazon declined to comment. Airbus, Intel and Qualcomm confirmed they on one or more applications, with Airbus noting it is interested in topics like risk analysis for airspace management. Qualcomm hopes to test network connectivity along with partners Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T; Inc. Raytheon Co (RTN.N) said it had not applied but was in talks with partners who have. Other companies did not immediately answer requests for comment. Changes to U.S. policy that result from the tests are not expected for some time. Package delivery, which can be particularly complex, might not take place until later on during the program. Earl Lawrence, who directs the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration’s unmanned aircraft systems integration office, told a Senate panel on Tuesday that many of the other projects “could go forward under the FAA’s existing rules, including with waivers where appropriate.” He said after “the 10 selections for the pilot program are announced, the FAA will be reaching out to other applicants, as well as interested state and local authorities, to provide additional information on how to operationalize their proposed projects.” The FAA is also working on proposed regulations to ensure the safety of drones and their integration into U.S. airspace.  The initiative is significant for the United States, which has lagged other countries in drone operations for fear of air crashes. That had pushed companies like Amazon to experiment overseas. In the United Kingdom, the world’s largest online retailer already sends some packages by drone. It completed its first such mission in late 2016, taking 13 minutes from click to delivery.
